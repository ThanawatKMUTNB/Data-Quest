suspect after studio blazePublished19 July 2019SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Kyoto Animation offices on fireJapanese police have named the man suspected of carrying out a deadly arson attack on an animation studio.Shinji Aoba was taken into police custody in hospital and was being treated there for burns.The fire swept through Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) on Thursday, claiming at least 33 lives and injuring many in one of Japan\'s worst mass killings in years.People who witnessed Shinji Aoba\'s arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouted: ""Die!"" In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation\'s president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building\'s roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building\'s third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan\'s fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building\'s three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni\'s series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry\'s standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive.\xa0Battles in Donbas will look like World War Two, says UkraineCourt orders vote into Pakistan PM Khan leadershipPublished1 hour agoRussian troops discussed killings in Bucha - reportPublished2 hours agoFeaturesDo Bucha civilian killings amount to genocide?Hindu-Muslim divide tarnishing India\'s Silicon ValleyRussian forces focus on the south and east of UkraineA spellbinder\'s story of survival, no longer kept secretUkraine\'s dream of a Eurovision win.

This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we\'ve seen before.Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The judging panel consists of THE9\'s Esther Yu, actress Angelababy and rapper Lil Ghost - a former talent show discoveryiQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray.Among the 31 virtual contenders, there\'s an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges\' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show\'s judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards.Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman.  On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Why I \'married\' a cartoon characterThe curious rise of virtual celebritiesK-pop band\'s panda cuddle raises hackles in ChinaTalent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain\'s Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China\'s youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that\'s why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London\'s Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend\'s game character Akali perform \'offline\' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year\'s research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters \'to life\'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show\'s judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they\'re multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China\'s Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China\'s Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show\'s design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China\'s Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we\'ve seen before.Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The judging panel consists of THE9\'s Esther Yu, actress Angelababy and rapper Lil Ghost - a former talent show discoveryiQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray.Among the 31 virtual contenders, there\'s an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges\' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show\'s judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards.Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman.  On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Why I \'married\' a cartoon characterThe curious rise of virtual celebritiesK-pop band\'s panda cuddle raises hackles in ChinaTalent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain\'s Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China\'s youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that\'s why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London\'s Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend\'s game character Akali perform \'offline\' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year\'s research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters \'to life\'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show\'s judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they\'re multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China\'s Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China\'s Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show\'s design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China\'s Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

Pokémon started life as an 8-bit video game in Japan -  where players capture creatures and store them in pocket-sized capsules (Pokémon is short for ""pocket monsters"") - but has grown into a cultural megahit.By some estimates, Pokémon is now the biggest media franchise in history, worth more than Harry Potter and Star Wars combined. Over its 25-year journey, it has spawned several global crazes, involving celebrities paying millions for trading cards and people walking tens of thousands of kilometres in pursuit of rare monsters. These are the moments when Pokémania swept the globe.Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold!Image source, Tom BatemanImage caption, Pikachu, one of 898 monsters in the Pokémon world, is the most recognisablePokémon started small. The game\'s developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. ""It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,"" says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games\' development team.  He turned out to be right. The series\' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version. ""But we never considered selling Pokémon abroad,"" Mr Ishihara says.""People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn\'t play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.""Image source, Tom BatemanPokémon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pokémon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.""All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that\'s when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games\' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. ""The cool thing about Pokémon is it\'s a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there\'d probably be someone that I know from Pokémon that I could probably crash with. I think that\'s so cool,"" he says. 16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 secondsOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. The channel, ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"", broadcast a stream of Pokémon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch\'s built-in chat. ""I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You\'ve got the video, you\'ve got the chat, it was right for something like that,"" says Marcus ""djWHEAT"" Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.Image source, TwitchImage caption, Tens of thousands of players are controlling one character""The streamer\'s original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I\'ll begin parsing them into the game and we\'ll see what chaos this creates,"" he says. The chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.Twitch Plays Pokémon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream\'s peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream\'s most beloved Pokémon to be ""released"", meaning they were lost forever. But after 16 days, seven hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds of play, the stream completed the game. In all, 1.16 million people had played, and more than nine million had watched. Marcus Graham believes the ""Pokémon"" part of Twitch Plays Pokémon was the key to success, as the stream combined the simple goals of catching monsters and collecting gym badges with players\' nostalgia for the classic game and its cast of familiar characters. ""I really do think that because the game was Pokémon that played a massive part in the explosive virality of it all. It was kind of that perfect storm.""Gotta catch \'em allWhile the world watched millions play Pokémon Red on Twitch, a Japanese software engineer was working on an April Fool\'s joke. Tatsuo Nomura (who declined to be interviewed for this article) worked for Google\'s maps division. A Pokémon fan since childhood, Nomura decided to blend the two, hiding Pokémon on a map of the world for users to find. Image source, PG/Bauer-Griffin""Mr Nomura used to find exploits in Pokémon Red and Green when he was a kid, that\'s how he became interested in computer programming,"" explains the Pokémon Company\'s Tsunekazu Ishihara, who greenlit the project after receiving a pitch from Google-owned game developer Niantic.""That passion led him to join Google, then Google Maps, and consequently he created Pokémon GO.""The mobile game was an instant success, introducing millions of players to a world of ""augmented reality"" gaming. To play, users must walk around in the real world in order to find and catch Pokémon on their phone screens.One Japanese player, playing under the name Kyarorina, got hooked after his workplace organised a walking competition for its staff.   ""The goal of simply walking turned into an obsession with chasing after rare Pokémon and catching them all,"" he says.The stats tell the full story: since first downloading Pokémon GO in July 2016, he has walked over 31,000km (19,200 miles) and visited more than a million Pokéstops - real-life locations where players can collect in-game items. In 2019, Kyarorina became the first person to catch one million Pokémon in-game. Image source, The Pokemon CompanyImage caption, Some of the most popular characters""Recently I\'ve been spending about eight to 10 hours a day catching Pokémon, about 2,000 a day. I think I\'ll hit two million by the end of this month and announce it on Twitter,"" he tells the BBC.Pokémon GO\'s initial popularity was matched by its profitability. In 2020, five years after the game was first released, it saw record revenues of over $1bn (£718m). The free-to-play game makes money both by charging players for items and by charging businesses for the privilege of appearing on the in-game map. For Neriko Doerr and Debra Occhi, cultural anthropologists who co-authored a book on Pokémon GO, the game is evidence of Pokémon\'s broad appeal - something that can help explain the franchise\'s success. ""Pokemon GO attracted people who are into going outside, walking around and people who are happy with just collecting Pokemon into the game world, some of whom became very enthusiastic,"" Ms Doerr says.The red pinsAs Pokémon\'s 25th birthday approached, the franchise once again hit headlines as YouTuber Logan Paul paid $2m for six boxes of vintage Pokémon cards.""This is a newfound obsession of mine and I am so excited to share it with other enthusiasts around the world,"" the controversial entertainer wrote on social media.  Image source, Yvonne Hemsey""Pokemon cards have always been highly prized,"" says Tracy Martin, an expert in valuing post-war collectables. ""This is down to nostalgia and obviously the rarity of a card, but also Pokemon is still very current. It\'s a phenomenon that seems to grip both children and adults, and that\'s the main reason why it\'s still going strong,"" she says. ""That was not what we expected,"" says Pokémon\'s Tsunekazu Ishihara, who was himself featured on a Pokémon card that last year sold for $50,000.So what does Ishihara expect the next 25 years will bring for Pokémon? ""World domination"" he says, eyes fixed on the red pins that dot his map.

The series\' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version.

I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that\'s when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games\' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK.

According to Twitch, the stream\'s peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream\'s most beloved Pokémon to be ""released"", meaning they were lost forever.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC\'s Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife\'s voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he\'s holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko\'s ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe\'s the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn\'t official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that\'s obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko\'s hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year\'s survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won\'t consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it\'s getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it\'s a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there\'s lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that\'s not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there\'s a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan\'s economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I\'ve never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I\'m not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That\'s why I love her and why she\'s so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can\'t do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can\'t do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan\'s hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan\'s elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of \'came out\',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he\'s open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He\'s working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku\'s written above the doorbell.And most importantly he\'s happy.""In this society there\'s a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family. But that shouldn\'t be the only way. I don\'t fall into that template. ""We have to consider all kinds of love and all kinds of happiness.""You may also be interested in:Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC\'s Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife\'s voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he\'s holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko\'s ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe\'s the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn\'t official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that\'s obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko\'s hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year\'s survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won\'t consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it\'s getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it\'s a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there\'s lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that\'s not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there\'s a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan\'s economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I\'ve never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I\'m not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That\'s why I love her and why she\'s so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can\'t do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can\'t do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan\'s hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan\'s elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of \'came out\',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he\'s open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He\'s working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku\'s written above the doorbell.And most importantly he\'s happy.""In this society there\'s a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC\'s Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife\'s voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he\'s holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko\'s ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe\'s the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn\'t official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that\'s obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko\'s hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year\'s survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won\'t consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it\'s getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it\'s a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there\'s lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that\'s not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there\'s a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan\'s economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I\'ve never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I\'m not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That\'s why I love her and why she\'s so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can\'t do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can\'t do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan\'s hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan\'s elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of \'came out\',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he\'s open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He\'s working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku\'s written above the doorbell.And most importantly he\'s happy.""In this society there\'s a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family.

It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it.
