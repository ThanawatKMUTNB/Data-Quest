this show, I can say that this is the very definition of masterpiece. A genuine masterpiece. if you are not fond of a lot of symbolism and a \"Show, not Tell\" visual storytelling technique in this show, then this is not for you.  \r let alone the most controversial theme of this anime. I know, a lot of people tried nitpicking the show about discrimination and racism on the first cour that they forgot how well written these characters are. I must say that's just 10% of the show, hating the show because of the theme won't work on me. It only serves as a drive for the character development. If you compare 86 Eighty-six to its predecessors that shares the same theme (Aldnoah, Code Geass both R1 and Akito the Exiled, FMAB, Shingeki no Kyojin etc...). is that it dives deeper into characterization instead of just leaving it as if it did not affect the character at all. I've never felt like this in 11 years since the FMA: Brotherhood. Do people just like to hate what's popular and forget the main point of the story? I love every anime that was produced earlier and up to this date.   \r So for the review, this is just my summary and will not go into details. I'm not that vocal when it comes to anime review.  \r Storyline 10/10: A balanced dialogue and more visual storytelling compared to most anime, attention to detail are top-notch, a lot of foreshadowing and symbolism. So for the story, the first cour covers their everyday life on the frontline while the second cour focuses on the 86's (especially Shin's) experience and relationship with the new peaceful environment they're in, finding their purpose in life only to return back again. Moving on from the battlefield takes a LOT of time, especially when fighting till death is their daily routine. The pacing is great, just enough to understand whole point of the story. We can see the main antagonist of the story (Legion) are evolving both their strategy and military strength. The world building you will see in the anime is just the beginning and will get 20/10 better as soon as the next arc kicks in.  \r Art 10/10: Art is good, not to mention the great use of CGI animation, probably one of the best mechanical CGI I've seen that just felt right. Thanks I-IV for the mechanical designs you made for 86, The design is so great that it convinces me that it can be made in real life, compared to other mecha counterpart, this is the first one I think(my experience) that is supported by real life technical req. and blueprints inspired from world war 2 and cold war era. Its just that accurate. \r Characters 10/10: Characters are very well-written, as much as the 86's tries to fit in, we can see their struggles on the society/environment they're in. We got new characters that vital on the next arc and beyond (further character development will come soon). What I like on 86 Eighty-six is that not one of them have a victim mentality, a character that knows their responsibility upholding their morals ever since the previous spearhead squadron's founding. Seeing our Reaper, slowly regaining his emotion and become more human than he was before he put his brother to rest was an honest heartbreaking moment. If anything a person would say its your regular shounen? then you are a lost soul.  \r Sound 10/10: the soundtrack are amazing, thanks to Amazarashi, Kohta Yamamoto, and Hiroyuki Sawano. especially the last two endings. The opening music is a total banger and the ending song from episode 23 (epilogue of vol. 3) LilaS sang by Honoka Takahashi. Everything was spot-on emotional and meaningful. Not one 86 Eighty-six fans can forget.  \r \"I won't forget\".  \r Overall 11/10: This has to be the best season 1 with sequel, ending of an anime that no one in the anime series ever reached before which rivals the so called 'best' from any generation, to see the weakest arc get adapted into a masterpiece? I would highly recommend this show. Again, lot of symbolism and a \"Show, not Tell\" visual storytelling since the first cour thanks to passionate director, staffs and author herself, Asato Asato. If not this year, then sooner or later, 86 Eighty-six will get the fame and recognition it deserves.

If anything a person would say its your regular shounen? then you are a lost soul.  \r Sound 10/10: the soundtrack are amazing, thanks to Amazarashi, Kohta Yamamoto, and Hiroyuki Sawano. especially the last two endings. The opening music is a total banger and the ending song from episode 23 (epilogue of vol. 3) LilaS sang by Honoka Takahashi. Everything was spot-on emotional and meaningful. Not one 86 Eighty-six fans can forget.  \r \"I won't forget\".  \r Overall 11/10: This has to be the best season 1 with sequel, ending of an anime that no one in the anime series ever reached before which rivals the so called 'best' from any generation, to see the weakest arc get adapted into a masterpiece? I would highly recommend this show. Again, lot of symbolism and a \"Show, not Tell\" visual storytelling since the first cour thanks to passionate director, staffs and author herself, Asato Asato. If not this year, then sooner or later, 86 Eighty-six will get the fame and recognition it deserves.

A genuine masterpiece. if you are not fond of a lot of symbolism and a \"Show, not Tell\" visual storytelling technique in this show, then this is not for you.  \r let alone the most controversial theme of this anime. I know, a lot of people tried nitpicking the show about discrimination and racism on the first cour that they forgot how well written these characters are. I must say that's just 10% of the show, hating the show because of the theme won't work on me. It only serves as a drive for the character development. If you compare 86 Eighty-six to its predecessors that shares the same theme (Aldnoah, Code Geass both R1 and Akito the Exiled, FMAB, Shingeki no Kyojin etc...). is that it dives deeper into characterization instead of just leaving it as if it did not affect the character at all. I've never felt like this in 11 years since the FMA: Brotherhood. Do people just like to hate what's popular and forget the main point of the story? I love every anime that was produced earlier and up to this date.   \r So for the review, this is just my summary and will not go into details. I'm not that vocal when it comes to anime review.  \r Storyline 10/10: A balanced dialogue and more visual storytelling compared to most anime, attention to detail are top-notch, a lot of foreshadowing and symbolism. So for the story, the first cour covers their everyday life on the frontline while the second cour focuses on the 86's (especially Shin's) experience and relationship with the new peaceful environment they're in, finding their purpose in life only to return back again. Moving on from the battlefield takes a LOT of time, especially when fighting till death is their daily routine. The pacing is great, just enough to understand whole point of the story. We can see the main antagonist of the story (Legion) are evolving both their strategy and military strength. The world building you will see in the anime is just the beginning and will get 20/10 better as soon as the next arc kicks in.  \r Art 10/10: Art is good, not to mention the great use of CGI animation, probably one of the best mechanical CGI I've seen that just felt right. Thanks I-IV for the mechanical designs you made for 86, The design is so great that it convinces me that it can be made in real life, compared to other mecha counterpart, this is the first one I think(my experience) that is supported by real life technical req. and blueprints inspired from world war 2 and cold war era. Its just that accurate. \r Characters 10/10: Characters are very well-written, as much as the 86's tries to fit in, we can see their struggles on the society/environment they're in. We got new characters that vital on the next arc and beyond (further character development will come soon).

remember that anime is not made by studios, but people. They may be released and financed under the company name, but it is men and women, sometimes from around the world, who are the ones that actually put pen to paper (or stylus and mouse to screen, rather) to produce the content we care about. The studios\u2019 management is involved as well, but the current landscape of the anime industry is often not friendly to its staff, sometimes dumping projects on them with no time to get them finished or rushing them out the door despite their lacking quality. More and more stories like these are becoming documented, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge them. \r \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" was a Winter 2022 anime that regrettably got this problem. One month before the show started airing, key animation director Kiminori Itou vocally stated on Twitter that he was not optimistic about the project, and that the amount of time given to the production paled in comparison to CloverWorks\u2019 other two shows that aired this season, Akebi\u2019s Sailor Uniform and My Dress-Up Darling. This puts \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" in a weird light \u2013 if it succeeded despite itself, it would be all the more impressive. If it failed, it would likely be the result of the series not having enough time to pull itself together. Whether that is the result of CloverWorks themselves, or Aniplex, the company that licensed it, we can only guess. Either way, it is the end product that determines an outcome like that. \r The series takes place in a futuristic, economically-divided ward that might be integrated into the larger city of Tokyo. After their friend Asumi dies in a fire at their old elementary school, childhood friends Shuta, Ran, and Koki all receive a mysterious phone call at the same time from someone claiming to be Asumi. Upon answering the call, they receive a vision of one of their friends and her dog stuck on a railroad track and must decide whether to allow the train to hit them or slow down the train and risk hurting the passengers. <play that sequence> The phone call also imbues them with enhanced abilities, as they spring into action to try and resolve this rather-literal Trolley Problem. As time passes, more Trolley Problem complications will be presented that the three friends must contend with, and it will test the boundaries of their friendships, the ward, and whatever is causing these things to happen. \r One of the Trolley Problem\u2019s caveats in practical application, among many, is that it presents two moral extremes for which there is no possible alternative, which dangerously runs the risk of being too disconnected or disassociated from real life to have any significant meaning (even if one can cherry-pick actual stories of Trolley Problem-esque occurrences). An additional downside is that it can reduce a person\u2019s perception of a situation down to its numerical value rather than an empathic value, which doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for psychological interpretation. To put it another way as Spock did, one could look at the Problem and argue that \u201cthe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,\u201d without understanding the resulting implications for who lives and who dies and the world beyond the problem\u2019s framework. Thus, a story using the Trolley Problem starts on a fundamentally shaky ground because it needs to frame the scenarios as being justifiable both in terms of setting them up and the extremes it presents. \r The fact that \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" takes place in a futuristic setting allows its incorporation of the Trolley Problem to work more seamlessly than it would otherwise. Because the series utilizes advanced machines, surveillance, and revolves primarily around the lives of its three main characters, the Problems read as being the expected result of things not occurring within expected parameters. The machines not doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, or actually doing precisely what they\u2019re supposed to be doing but in an unforeseen manner, is why the Trolley Problems themselves manifest. Shuta, Ran, and Koki all have various outlooks on the Problems, which helps fuel the conflict surrounding the moralistic decisions they face, as well as their tolerance of each other\u2019s reasoning. \r But as far as the three friends are concerned, their chemistry together, regardless of being fractured from Asumi\u2019s death, isn\u2019t pleasant to watch. Shuta fashions himself as the hero of the 24th Ward and upset that he failed to save Asumi, but fails moreso to have a character beyond being a \u201cnice guy\u201d with a superhero ideology, and sadly not much in the way of intelligence. Wanting to help people is certainly noble, but the more-fascinating relationship among the mains, the one between Ran and Koki, is such because they are at complete odds with one another \u2013 Ran is a graffiti artist that uses his talents to convey messages, while Koki is a by-the-book, calculating individual with a penchant for siding with law and order. They naturally gravitate towards different circles and schools of thought. \r Interestingly enough, for people who supposedly care so much about Asumi, including the fact that Koki is her brother, it is mind-boggling that Shuta, Ran, and Koki never at any point have an earnest conversation about whether it really is Asumi talking to them, or someone pretending to be her. Especially given the crazy happenings that led to the events in episode one\u2019s climax, one would reasonably expect that there would be some kind of brainstorming session to determine what precisely happened. Even if no conclusion had been reached, even if tempers get particularly flared, or even absent any agreement, this is a conversation that needed to happen. Months in-universe transpire without that dialogue. \r The reason for this is because, without Asumi\u2019s insistence that when the three are working together that anything is possible, the narrative doesn\u2019t really have a friendship to cultivate for them. The show plays up the chasm between the three in light of Asumi\u2019s death, which makes sense. But whether through flashback or present-time events, we see little evidence of an earnestness between the mains that existed beforehand. Hence, a dialogue taking place evaluating the truth of whether Asumi called them after the first episode cannot happen because the connection via friendship is, more or less, nonexistent.  \r Instead, the second episode follows the Ward putting on a cooking festival for the residents, resulting in a controversy over someone buying up all the cabbage. This handling of storytelling priority is a part of what makes \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" so bewildering; the series will propose plots or threads that are theoretically interesting, but shies away from exploring many of them. And when it does try to explore some of those threads, its sense of dramaturgy makes for some questionable decisions. During that same cooking festival arc, the three main characters are outside a warehouse and are deciding whether to bust in and get the cabbage they need for their friend\u2019s okonomiyaki recipe, only to be told by someone that they don\u2019t need to do that because they found some more cabbage lying around that they could use. There\u2019s a build-up that insinuates some kind of action-style sequence will occur, only to pull the rug out from under itself by saying that such a thing wasn\u2019t necessary in the first place. <play that sequence> \r The roster of secondary characters is wide, and it\u2019s rather sad that they tend to be vastly more interesting and theoretically-compelling than most stories involving the trio. Given the outcomes of some of the Trolley Problems that take place, the secondaries occasionally have to face the ramifications of the trio\u2019s decisions. Kozue is one particular character who stands out in this respect, as an entire episode is centered around her in the aftershock of what happened. But she, like many others, is stymied by \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" having her take actions or decisions that either lead to unspectacular payoffs via poor buildup or head-scratching choices.  \r And unfortunately, not even the overall animation or aesthetic can carry the show along, either. It seems that Kiminori Itou\u2019s frustrations make themselves most evident in this regard. Despite the decent look of the cityscape and the ward itself, the character designs are rather uninteresting or are, at worst, horribly off-model. Watching this show from week-to-week made it feel like the show got quite shortchanged in regards to the animation side of production, and given that episodes were delayed twice with a mid-series recap thrown in, this really becomes a nuisance. That doesn\u2019t mean that there are no moments that don\u2019t work, because some do. But given the level of animation CloverWorks is capable of, they are few and far between. <Asumi call sequence> \r Perhaps the biggest frustration within \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" is that the various ideas that are on display here are indeed more than capable of filling out a twelve-episode narrative. But as presented, it is oversaturated and cannot accommodate everything in a satisfactory manner. The result is a slew of concepts that are half-baked, unable to reach anything moderately close to full realization, whatever that could be. If the show wants to propose a series of ethical or moralistic decisions that our characters are thrust into, or paint its world with overarching themes that carry particular significance for its characters, then it needs to make a commitment to actually investigate them seriously. It doesn\u2019t need offer a complete, perfect solution to each question (and it would be presumptuous to assume one exists), but the exercise of engaging with the discussions the show wants to have must still be fun in and of itself. For me, this wasn\u2019t. \r One could argue that the series is not trying to actually probe that deeply about its concepts, that a series where conflicts are presented to generally last a couple of episodes doesn\u2019t bear the responsibility to fully flesh them out. But when the series puts forward the ideas of economic class disparity via Shantytown, ethical decisions about who should live and die via the Trolley Problems, technology\u2019s growing presence in our lives and its misuse, and stopping crimes before they happen (among other things), it\u2019s not really a compliment to make a claim that the show doesn\u2019t have to put in the legwork. It doesn\u2019t need to be on the level of elegant prose, but it cannot read as disingenuous, which was what it left me with. By the time the final episode had rolled around and presented its last predicament, my interest had, much like Asumi, long since died. \r \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" is an inconsistent lumping of concepts and aesthetic, trying to have its various pieces come together in a way that makes sense, but cannot commit to doing so. Its drama often does not work both at the individual episodic level and the grander narrative overall, with characters making unusual decisions or having revelations that lack dramatic weight and sensibility. The designs are often off-model, and the plot is a hodgepodge of events that don\u2019t deliver despite trying to make use of its Trolley Problem framework. Ultimately, it was a misfire. It\u2019s ironic that a series about having to make decisions with little time to spare was made by animators and writers with little time to spare themselves. Delaying an episode an extra week or having a placeholder recap is only a temporary band-aid for a larger wound. This is one case however where life imitating art resulted in the worser of two results.

They may be released and financed under the company name, but it is men and women, sometimes from around the world, who are the ones that actually put pen to paper (or stylus and mouse to screen, rather) to produce the content we care about. The studios\u2019 management is involved as well, but the current landscape of the anime industry is often not friendly to its staff, sometimes dumping projects on them with no time to get them finished or rushing them out the door despite their lacking quality. More and more stories like these are becoming documented, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge them. \r \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" was a Winter 2022 anime that regrettably got this problem. One month before the show started airing, key animation director Kiminori Itou vocally stated on Twitter that he was not optimistic about the project, and that the amount of time given to the production paled in comparison to CloverWorks\u2019 other two shows that aired this season, Akebi\u2019s Sailor Uniform and My Dress-Up Darling. This puts \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" in a weird light \u2013 if it succeeded despite itself, it would be all the more impressive. If it failed, it would likely be the result of the series not having enough time to pull itself together. Whether that is the result of CloverWorks themselves, or Aniplex, the company that licensed it, we can only guess. Either way, it is the end product that determines an outcome like that. \r The series takes place in a futuristic, economically-divided ward that might be integrated into the larger city of Tokyo. After their friend Asumi dies in a fire at their old elementary school, childhood friends Shuta, Ran, and Koki all receive a mysterious phone call at the same time from someone claiming to be Asumi. Upon answering the call, they receive a vision of one of their friends and her dog stuck on a railroad track and must decide whether to allow the train to hit them or slow down the train and risk hurting the passengers. <play that sequence> The phone call also imbues them with enhanced abilities, as they spring into action to try and resolve this rather-literal Trolley Problem. As time passes, more Trolley Problem complications will be presented that the three friends must contend with, and it will test the boundaries of their friendships, the ward, and whatever is causing these things to happen. \r One of the Trolley Problem\u2019s caveats in practical application, among many, is that it presents two moral extremes for which there is no possible alternative, which dangerously runs the risk of being too disconnected or disassociated from real life to have any significant meaning (even if one can cherry-pick actual stories of Trolley Problem-esque occurrences). An additional downside is that it can reduce a person\u2019s perception of a situation down to its numerical value rather than an empathic value, which doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for psychological interpretation. To put it another way as Spock did, one could look at the Problem and argue that \u201cthe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,\u201d without understanding the resulting implications for who lives and who dies and the world beyond the problem\u2019s framework. Thus, a story using the Trolley Problem starts on a fundamentally shaky ground because it needs to frame the scenarios as being justifiable both in terms of setting them up and the extremes it presents. \r The fact that \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" takes place in a futuristic setting allows its incorporation of the Trolley Problem to work more seamlessly than it would otherwise. Because the series utilizes advanced machines, surveillance, and revolves primarily around the lives of its three main characters, the Problems read as being the expected result of things not occurring within expected parameters. The machines not doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, or actually doing precisely what they\u2019re supposed to be doing but in an unforeseen manner, is why the Trolley Problems themselves manifest. Shuta, Ran, and Koki all have various outlooks on the Problems, which helps fuel the conflict surrounding the moralistic decisions they face, as well as their tolerance of each other\u2019s reasoning. \r But as far as the three friends are concerned, their chemistry together, regardless of being fractured from Asumi\u2019s death, isn\u2019t pleasant to watch. Shuta fashions himself as the hero of the 24th Ward and upset that he failed to save Asumi, but fails moreso to have a character beyond being a \u201cnice guy\u201d with a superhero ideology, and sadly not much in the way of intelligence. Wanting to help people is certainly noble, but the more-fascinating relationship among the mains, the one between Ran and Koki, is such because they are at complete odds with one another \u2013 Ran is a graffiti artist that uses his talents to convey messages, while Koki is a by-the-book, calculating individual with a penchant for siding with law and order. They naturally gravitate towards different circles and schools of thought. \r Interestingly enough, for people who supposedly care so much about Asumi, including the fact that Koki is her brother, it is mind-boggling that Shuta, Ran, and Koki never at any point have an earnest conversation about whether it really is Asumi talking to them, or someone pretending to be her. Especially given the crazy happenings that led to the events in episode one\u2019s climax, one would reasonably expect that there would be some kind of brainstorming session to determine what precisely happened. Even if no conclusion had been reached, even if tempers get particularly flared, or even absent any agreement, this is a conversation that needed to happen. Months in-universe transpire without that dialogue. \r The reason for this is because, without Asumi\u2019s insistence that when the three are working together that anything is possible, the narrative doesn\u2019t really have a friendship to cultivate for them. The show plays up the chasm between the three in light of Asumi\u2019s death, which makes sense. But whether through flashback or present-time events, we see little evidence of an earnestness between the mains that existed beforehand. Hence, a dialogue taking place evaluating the truth of whether Asumi called them after the first episode cannot happen because the connection via friendship is, more or less, nonexistent.  \r Instead, the second episode follows the Ward putting on a cooking festival for the residents, resulting in a controversy over someone buying up all the cabbage. This handling of storytelling priority is a part of what makes \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" so bewildering; the series will propose plots or threads that are theoretically interesting, but shies away from exploring many of them. And when it does try to explore some of those threads, its sense of dramaturgy makes for some questionable decisions. During that same cooking festival arc, the three main characters are outside a warehouse and are deciding whether to bust in and get the cabbage they need for their friend\u2019s okonomiyaki recipe, only to be told by someone that they don\u2019t need to do that because they found some more cabbage lying around that they could use. There\u2019s a build-up that insinuates some kind of action-style sequence will occur, only to pull the rug out from under itself by saying that such a thing wasn\u2019t necessary in the first place. <play that sequence> \r The roster of secondary characters is wide, and it\u2019s rather sad that they tend to be vastly more interesting and theoretically-compelling than most stories involving the trio. Given the outcomes of some of the Trolley Problems that take place, the secondaries occasionally have to face the ramifications of the trio\u2019s decisions. Kozue is one particular character who stands out in this respect, as an entire episode is centered around her in the aftershock of what happened. But she, like many others, is stymied by \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" having her take actions or decisions that either lead to unspectacular payoffs via poor buildup or head-scratching choices.  \r And unfortunately, not even the overall animation or aesthetic can carry the show along, either. It seems that Kiminori Itou\u2019s frustrations make themselves most evident in this regard. Despite the decent look of the cityscape and the ward itself, the character designs are rather uninteresting or are, at worst, horribly off-model. Watching this show from week-to-week made it feel like the show got quite shortchanged in regards to the animation side of production, and given that episodes were delayed twice with a mid-series recap thrown in, this really becomes a nuisance. That doesn\u2019t mean that there are no moments that don\u2019t work, because some do. But given the level of animation CloverWorks is capable of, they are few and far between. <Asumi call sequence> \r Perhaps the biggest frustration within \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" is that the various ideas that are on display here are indeed more than capable of filling out a twelve-episode narrative. But as presented, it is oversaturated and cannot accommodate everything in a satisfactory manner. The result is a slew of concepts that are half-baked, unable to reach anything moderately close to full realization, whatever that could be. If the show wants to propose a series of ethical or moralistic decisions that our characters are thrust into, or paint its world with overarching themes that carry particular significance for its characters, then it needs to make a commitment to actually investigate them seriously. It doesn\u2019t need offer a complete, perfect solution to each question (and it would be presumptuous to assume one exists), but the exercise of engaging with the discussions the show wants to have must still be fun in and of itself. For me, this wasn\u2019t. \r One could argue that the series is not trying to actually probe that deeply about its concepts, that a series where conflicts are presented to generally last a couple of episodes doesn\u2019t bear the responsibility to fully flesh them out. But when the series puts forward the ideas of economic class disparity via Shantytown, ethical decisions about who should live and die via the Trolley Problems, technology\u2019s growing presence in our lives and its misuse, and stopping crimes before they happen (among other things), it\u2019s not really a compliment to make a claim that the show doesn\u2019t have to put in the legwork. It doesn\u2019t need to be on the level of elegant prose, but it cannot read as disingenuous, which was what it left me with. By the time the final episode had rolled around and presented its last predicament, my interest had, much like Asumi, long since died. \r \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" is an inconsistent lumping of concepts and aesthetic, trying to have its various pieces come together in a way that makes sense, but cannot commit to doing so. Its drama often does not work both at the individual episodic level and the grander narrative overall, with characters making unusual decisions or having revelations that lack dramatic weight and sensibility. The designs are often off-model, and the plot is a hodgepodge of events that don\u2019t deliver despite trying to make use of its Trolley Problem framework. Ultimately, it was a misfire. It\u2019s ironic that a series about having to make decisions with little time to spare was made by animators and writers with little time to spare themselves. Delaying an episode an extra week or having a placeholder recap is only a temporary band-aid for a larger wound.

Upon answering the call, they receive a vision of one of their friends and her dog stuck on a railroad track and must decide whether to allow the train to hit them or slow down the train and risk hurting the passengers. <play that sequence> The phone call also imbues them with enhanced abilities, as they spring into action to try and resolve this rather-literal Trolley Problem. As time passes, more Trolley Problem complications will be presented that the three friends must contend with, and it will test the boundaries of their friendships, the ward, and whatever is causing these things to happen. \r One of the Trolley Problem\u2019s caveats in practical application, among many, is that it presents two moral extremes for which there is no possible alternative, which dangerously runs the risk of being too disconnected or disassociated from real life to have any significant meaning (even if one can cherry-pick actual stories of Trolley Problem-esque occurrences). An additional downside is that it can reduce a person\u2019s perception of a situation down to its numerical value rather than an empathic value, which doesn\u2019t necessarily bode well for psychological interpretation. To put it another way as Spock did, one could look at the Problem and argue that \u201cthe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,\u201d without understanding the resulting implications for who lives and who dies and the world beyond the problem\u2019s framework. Thus, a story using the Trolley Problem starts on a fundamentally shaky ground because it needs to frame the scenarios as being justifiable both in terms of setting them up and the extremes it presents. \r The fact that \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" takes place in a futuristic setting allows its incorporation of the Trolley Problem to work more seamlessly than it would otherwise. Because the series utilizes advanced machines, surveillance, and revolves primarily around the lives of its three main characters, the Problems read as being the expected result of things not occurring within expected parameters. The machines not doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, or actually doing precisely what they\u2019re supposed to be doing but in an unforeseen manner, is why the Trolley Problems themselves manifest. Shuta, Ran, and Koki all have various outlooks on the Problems, which helps fuel the conflict surrounding the moralistic decisions they face, as well as their tolerance of each other\u2019s reasoning. \r But as far as the three friends are concerned, their chemistry together, regardless of being fractured from Asumi\u2019s death, isn\u2019t pleasant to watch. Shuta fashions himself as the hero of the 24th Ward and upset that he failed to save Asumi, but fails moreso to have a character beyond being a \u201cnice guy\u201d with a superhero ideology, and sadly not much in the way of intelligence. Wanting to help people is certainly noble, but the more-fascinating relationship among the mains, the one between Ran and Koki, is such because they are at complete odds with one another \u2013 Ran is a graffiti artist that uses his talents to convey messages, while Koki is a by-the-book, calculating individual with a penchant for siding with law and order. They naturally gravitate towards different circles and schools of thought. \r Interestingly enough, for people who supposedly care so much about Asumi, including the fact that Koki is her brother, it is mind-boggling that Shuta, Ran, and Koki never at any point have an earnest conversation about whether it really is Asumi talking to them, or someone pretending to be her. Especially given the crazy happenings that led to the events in episode one\u2019s climax, one would reasonably expect that there would be some kind of brainstorming session to determine what precisely happened. Even if no conclusion had been reached, even if tempers get particularly flared, or even absent any agreement, this is a conversation that needed to happen. Months in-universe transpire without that dialogue. \r The reason for this is because, without Asumi\u2019s insistence that when the three are working together that anything is possible, the narrative doesn\u2019t really have a friendship to cultivate for them. The show plays up the chasm between the three in light of Asumi\u2019s death, which makes sense. But whether through flashback or present-time events, we see little evidence of an earnestness between the mains that existed beforehand. Hence, a dialogue taking place evaluating the truth of whether Asumi called them after the first episode cannot happen because the connection via friendship is, more or less, nonexistent.  \r Instead, the second episode follows the Ward putting on a cooking festival for the residents, resulting in a controversy over someone buying up all the cabbage. This handling of storytelling priority is a part of what makes \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" so bewildering; the series will propose plots or threads that are theoretically interesting, but shies away from exploring many of them. And when it does try to explore some of those threads, its sense of dramaturgy makes for some questionable decisions. During that same cooking festival arc, the three main characters are outside a warehouse and are deciding whether to bust in and get the cabbage they need for their friend\u2019s okonomiyaki recipe, only to be told by someone that they don\u2019t need to do that because they found some more cabbage lying around that they could use. There\u2019s a build-up that insinuates some kind of action-style sequence will occur, only to pull the rug out from under itself by saying that such a thing wasn\u2019t necessary in the first place. <play that sequence> \r The roster of secondary characters is wide, and it\u2019s rather sad that they tend to be vastly more interesting and theoretically-compelling than most stories involving the trio. Given the outcomes of some of the Trolley Problems that take place, the secondaries occasionally have to face the ramifications of the trio\u2019s decisions. Kozue is one particular character who stands out in this respect, as an entire episode is centered around her in the aftershock of what happened. But she, like many others, is stymied by \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" having her take actions or decisions that either lead to unspectacular payoffs via poor buildup or head-scratching choices.  \r And unfortunately, not even the overall animation or aesthetic can carry the show along, either. It seems that Kiminori Itou\u2019s frustrations make themselves most evident in this regard. Despite the decent look of the cityscape and the ward itself, the character designs are rather uninteresting or are, at worst, horribly off-model. Watching this show from week-to-week made it feel like the show got quite shortchanged in regards to the animation side of production, and given that episodes were delayed twice with a mid-series recap thrown in, this really becomes a nuisance. That doesn\u2019t mean that there are no moments that don\u2019t work, because some do. But given the level of animation CloverWorks is capable of, they are few and far between. <Asumi call sequence> \r Perhaps the biggest frustration within \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" is that the various ideas that are on display here are indeed more than capable of filling out a twelve-episode narrative. But as presented, it is oversaturated and cannot accommodate everything in a satisfactory manner. The result is a slew of concepts that are half-baked, unable to reach anything moderately close to full realization, whatever that could be. If the show wants to propose a series of ethical or moralistic decisions that our characters are thrust into, or paint its world with overarching themes that carry particular significance for its characters, then it needs to make a commitment to actually investigate them seriously. It doesn\u2019t need offer a complete, perfect solution to each question (and it would be presumptuous to assume one exists), but the exercise of engaging with the discussions the show wants to have must still be fun in and of itself. For me, this wasn\u2019t. \r One could argue that the series is not trying to actually probe that deeply about its concepts, that a series where conflicts are presented to generally last a couple of episodes doesn\u2019t bear the responsibility to fully flesh them out. But when the series puts forward the ideas of economic class disparity via Shantytown, ethical decisions about who should live and die via the Trolley Problems, technology\u2019s growing presence in our lives and its misuse, and stopping crimes before they happen (among other things), it\u2019s not really a compliment to make a claim that the show doesn\u2019t have to put in the legwork. It doesn\u2019t need to be on the level of elegant prose, but it cannot read as disingenuous, which was what it left me with. By the time the final episode had rolled around and presented its last predicament, my interest had, much like Asumi, long since died. \r \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" is an inconsistent lumping of concepts and aesthetic, trying to have its various pieces come together in a way that makes sense, but cannot commit to doing so. Its drama often does not work both at the individual episodic level and the grander narrative overall, with characters making unusual decisions or having revelations that lack dramatic weight and sensibility. The designs are often off-model, and the plot is a hodgepodge of events that don\u2019t deliver despite trying to make use of its Trolley Problem framework. Ultimately, it was a misfire. It\u2019s ironic that a series about having to make decisions with little time to spare was made by animators and writers with little time to spare themselves. Delaying an episode an extra week or having a placeholder recap is only a temporary band-aid for a larger wound. This is one case however where life imitating art resulted in the worser of two results.

They may be released and financed under the company name, but it is men and women, sometimes from around the world, who are the ones that actually put pen to paper (or stylus and mouse to screen, rather) to produce the content we care about. The studios\u2019 management is involved as well, but the current landscape of the anime industry is often not friendly to its staff, sometimes dumping projects on them with no time to get them finished or rushing them out the door despite their lacking quality. More and more stories like these are becoming documented, and it\u2019s important to acknowledge them. \r \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" was a Winter 2022 anime that regrettably got this problem. One month before the show started airing, key animation director Kiminori Itou vocally stated on Twitter that he was not optimistic about the project, and that the amount of time given to the production paled in comparison to CloverWorks\u2019 other two shows that aired this season, Akebi\u2019s Sailor Uniform and My Dress-Up Darling. This puts \"Tokyo 24th Ward\" in a weird light \u2013 if it succeeded despite itself, it would be all the more impressive. If it failed, it would likely be the result of the series not having enough time to pull itself together. Whether that is the result of CloverWorks themselves, or Aniplex, the company that licensed it, we can only guess. Either way, it is the end product that determines an outcome like that. \r The series takes place in a futuristic, economically-divided ward that might be integrated into the larger city of Tokyo.

spoilers in this review, though it'd be best to put it all together like a fine douche portrait of an intellectual philisophical research paper of a work. \r Overly exuberant ambition, undermined by problems from behind-the-scenes pre-production woes to wistfully \"grand\" exposition and storytelling, that only begrdudgingly concocts as a servitude to hide the fact that you don't actually need to be a \"big brain\" of a fool to even understand a conch of this work. This is the story of Tokyo 24-ku a.k.a Tokyo 24th Ward, brought to you by CloverWorks, the studio now infamous for the \"3 shows per season lineup\" moniker that the Black Sheep of the season has to suffer inherent problems, and this show is that Black Sheep of blame. \r Let's start by laying the groundwork for this show: directed by Jojo director Naokatsu Tsuda, with scriptwriter and series composer Vio Shimokura from Nitroplus (the company responsible for churning out visual novel games, created from writers like the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi), Tokyo 24-ku can be summed with these words alone: groupism, artificial intelligence, altruism, utilitarianism, individualism, consequentialism, principle of double effect. But the most important aspect of how Tokyo 24-ku works is by this barreling issue called the \"trolley problem\", first invented and accounted in a 1967 philosophy paper by English philosopher Philippa Ruth Foot, one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics that are inspired by Aristotle, along with fellow philosophist Judith Jarvis Thomson. \r To understand Tokyo 24-ku, you need to understand what is this \"trolley problem\" all about. This thought experiment is described as such: a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number, that usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially \"safe\" person to save the others. \r And this trolley problem is placed on the 3 central characters: Shuta \"Shu\" Aoi, Ran Akagi and Koki \"Ko\" Suido, or as nicknamed as such: RGB, because of their hair colours. How all these events conspired to turn on their heads, falls on their history growing up in the 24th Ward a.k.a Shantytown as childhood friends with their own typical ambitions in life, being raised in different family backgrounds, hobbies and personalities, with friends being close and typical as family-like. But one event changes everything, and that's when their historic elementary school suffered an arson attack that at first, was thought to be a rando terrorist attack, but it was insignificant things like rats nibbling on old wiring that caused the school to catch fire, and that someone was Koki's younger sister Asumi whom was caught in the flames, the causal effect to lose her life. Asumi is close to the RGB boys, in fact, she'd call them as such to signify their closeness, but with her death, she is seemingly not done yet as her tentative soul lives through phone calls to the RGB guys to present to them the trolley problems known as \"Visions\", though for what purpose remains to be seen in the beginning, that slowly begins to unravel the ugliness that's harnessing those \"Visions\" and the very things that make up the special district of the 24th Ward. \r So first off, I mentioned that you do not need to have a big brain to understand this show, because at hindsight, these trolley problems or \"Visions\" start out as being 2-way choices of limiting innocent deaths by the count. But as time progresses, the Visions get progressively more nuanced, taking into accounts of the nihilistic nature of human radical behaviours from the likes of utilitarianism, altruism and consequentialism, that despite the descriptions of the trolley problem at hand, raises the stakes that would always result in a win-lose situation. And this is where the mysterious Carneades comes in to thwart the RGB guys, thereby raising the stakes higher that death is imminent for at least an innocent being despite the choices that they make. This is pretty significant because Carneades (in history) is known as an academic skeptic, whom holds the belief that all knowledge is impossible a.k.a acatalepsy (meaning \"inability to comprehend\", incomprehensibleness, or the impossibility of comprehending or conceiving a thing), except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible, that human knowledge never amounts to certainty, but only to plausibility. On the basis of truth, Carneades argues that if there were a criterion, it must exist either in reason (logos), sensation (aisth\u00easis), or conception (phantasia). But then reason itself depends on conception, and this again on sensation; have no means of judging whether humans' sensations are true or false, whether they correspond to the objects that produce them, or carry wrong impressions to the mind, producing false conceptions and ideas, and leading reason also into error. Therefore, sensation, conception, and reason, are alike disqualified for being the criterion of truth. \r Alas, the happenings within Shantytown have a butt-ton of problems to deal with. Starting with the RGB guys, or as I would like to call them, Shuta \"Mr. 24 hero\" Aoi, Ran \"DoRed\" Akagi and Koki \"SARG\" Suido, each of their ambitions are very different, and yet thus serve a different aspect that shows the faction divisions within the ward. The red-haired Ran Akagi is the leader of his graffiti group called DoRed, whom exhibits a strong personality and is able to convey his emotions and feelings through the art of graffiti, which has progressed in the series to be more like a cult following for people opposing the government's radical changes against their will. Together with friends like Kinako, technological hacker Kudo \"Kunai\" Naito, and influencers like Kuchikiri  (better known as 0th) Ran is a force to be reckoned with. The green-haired Koki Suido comes from his familial line of intelligents, with his father Gori being the mayor of the 24th Ward, save for the deceased sister Asumi. Together, they run the 24th Ward with the usual bigotry treatments of fabrications and lies (as you would expect of any governmental system) heralding from the system utilized to keep the ward in their grasp, funded with the help from fellow chief researcher Sakiko \"Satchan\" Tsuzuragawa. And this is so because Koki works in SARG, Shantytown's police faction equivalent to keep harmony within the midst from the likes of Hazard Cast (their version of police surveillance control) and the KANAE System, named after the Suido family's deceased mother (which is an upgraded feature that severely limits privacy in exchange for security) through phones specially supplied to and heavily controlled in the ward, known as cPhones. The blue-haired Shuta Aoi, he's your typical neighbourhood boy with a childish ambition to match, and is the one that always knocks time off around with the people of Shantytown, doing the regular work that's just like the normal average layman. Together with Mari Sakuragi whom manages the 24th Ward's popular okonomiyaki restaurant \"Itadaki\", Shuta is the most average person alive whom has a good side to him being of childlike wonder, yet scramble to action when the Visions occur because he finds it to be a recurring dilemma of choice, because he is known as Mr. 24 the hero of Shantytown, and he wouldn't want anyone dying right in front of his eyes to befall emotional curses upon himself. \r The other characters ploughing through this wonky series, it's sad but obvious to say that they're nothing more than plot movers, because where else would you concoct characters that only have ulterior motives, only to scrap them when their duties are done. Guess this shows that character dynamics are essential, yet when executed wrongly, can become the most glaring of issues to question why does \"this and that\" characters need to be around to begin with. A very hard pass on having too many characters to reflect the adage of \"too many cooks spoil the broth\". \r By now, you should've known the terror that is the behind-the-scenes production woes at CloverWorks, and probably already guessed it by now: the Wonder Egg Priority curse has struck again. In case you didn't know, in Japan, it's prohibited for staff to share what's going on with the production of shows, think of it as like NDAs. But yet above all, one person did: chief animation director Kiminori Itou, whose pessimistic troubles were so rampant enough that he literally documented, chronicled and shared the events leading up to release on his Twitter account. Starting way back last year on October 24th when the anime was officially announced (and mind you, that was after announcements for both Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi's Sailor Uniform), the staff only literally had 2 months (give and take) to create, make and finish the entire production, even if it meant that they had to outsource animators to finish up the job. To put things into perspective, Episode 1 (the double-length premiere) was only completed in the nick of time before the TV broadcast. What resulted in all of that was inconsistent animation, visuals that look nice but was hampered to the point of overlays (the RGB guys displayed many instances of overlay visuals), and though the CloverWorks name is attached to it, the perception that the Wonder Egg Priority curse had already taken over the entire anime in general was already realized even before we the audience actually got to see Episode 1 in the flesh. Yikes, what a mess. \r Of all the bad occurences in this show, there is some sliver of hope, and although the musical function is decent, I just can't feel it with so much dialogue and information being pushed down to our throats. All I can say that the OP is great, and come on, it's the same J-Pop band that brought you Vinland Saga's 1st OP. Survive Said The Prophet never misses, and shows their pedigree here. The ED's title references the RGB colour codes in unison to the RGB MCs, though the song is a bit on the meh side. \r When all is said and done, even after taking everything into consideration, music alone can't really save the entire hectic production that leaves people to having tireless crunch and overwork, it's just so inhumane to see this, but this is the life of the anime industry in Japan, and there's no way to salvage this practice for years to come (that's why we advocate KyoAni in a different light, geddit?). Whatever the reason here, if Wonder Egg Priority was a showcase that if not taken severely enough, then Tokyo 24-ku is the next work to point a finger at both CloverWorks and Aniplex on a practice so deadly that it could cost people their lives and precious time wasted. And this is a protest that the anime industry will not listen to, because it's quantity over quality, and money is the root of all evil. \r So there you have it: the classic case of greedy corporations at the oversight of quality, that rather of Tokyo 24-ku as a standalone show telling its own internal side of the story, there's an external side waiting to be scrutinized and criticized just as hard.

This is the story of Tokyo 24-ku a.k.a Tokyo 24th Ward, brought to you by CloverWorks, the studio now infamous for the \"3 shows per season lineup\" moniker that the Black Sheep of the season has to suffer inherent problems, and this show is that Black Sheep of blame. \r Let's start by laying the groundwork for this show: directed by Jojo director Naokatsu Tsuda, with scriptwriter and series composer Vio Shimokura from Nitroplus (the company responsible for churning out visual novel games, created from writers like the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi), Tokyo 24-ku can be summed with these words alone: groupism, artificial intelligence, altruism, utilitarianism, individualism, consequentialism, principle of double effect. But the most important aspect of how Tokyo 24-ku works is by this barreling issue called the \"trolley problem\", first invented and accounted in a 1967 philosophy paper by English philosopher Philippa Ruth Foot, one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics that are inspired by Aristotle, along with fellow philosophist Judith Jarvis Thomson. \r To understand Tokyo 24-ku, you need to understand what is this \"trolley problem\" all about. This thought experiment is described as such: a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number, that usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially \"safe\" person to save the others. \r And this trolley problem is placed on the 3 central characters: Shuta \"Shu\" Aoi, Ran Akagi and Koki \"Ko\" Suido, or as nicknamed as such: RGB, because of their hair colours. How all these events conspired to turn on their heads, falls on their history growing up in the 24th Ward a.k.a Shantytown as childhood friends with their own typical ambitions in life, being raised in different family backgrounds, hobbies and personalities, with friends being close and typical as family-like. But one event changes everything, and that's when their historic elementary school suffered an arson attack that at first, was thought to be a rando terrorist attack, but it was insignificant things like rats nibbling on old wiring that caused the school to catch fire, and that someone was Koki's younger sister Asumi whom was caught in the flames, the causal effect to lose her life. Asumi is close to the RGB boys, in fact, she'd call them as such to signify their closeness, but with her death, she is seemingly not done yet as her tentative soul lives through phone calls to the RGB guys to present to them the trolley problems known as \"Visions\", though for what purpose remains to be seen in the beginning, that slowly begins to unravel the ugliness that's harnessing those \"Visions\" and the very things that make up the special district of the 24th Ward. \r So first off, I mentioned that you do not need to have a big brain to understand this show, because at hindsight, these trolley problems or \"Visions\" start out as being 2-way choices of limiting innocent deaths by the count. But as time progresses, the Visions get progressively more nuanced, taking into accounts of the nihilistic nature of human radical behaviours from the likes of utilitarianism, altruism and consequentialism, that despite the descriptions of the trolley problem at hand, raises the stakes that would always result in a win-lose situation. And this is where the mysterious Carneades comes in to thwart the RGB guys, thereby raising the stakes higher that death is imminent for at least an innocent being despite the choices that they make. This is pretty significant because Carneades (in history) is known as an academic skeptic, whom holds the belief that all knowledge is impossible a.k.a acatalepsy (meaning \"inability to comprehend\", incomprehensibleness, or the impossibility of comprehending or conceiving a thing), except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible, that human knowledge never amounts to certainty, but only to plausibility. On the basis of truth, Carneades argues that if there were a criterion, it must exist either in reason (logos), sensation (aisth\u00easis), or conception (phantasia). But then reason itself depends on conception, and this again on sensation; have no means of judging whether humans' sensations are true or false, whether they correspond to the objects that produce them, or carry wrong impressions to the mind, producing false conceptions and ideas, and leading reason also into error. Therefore, sensation, conception, and reason, are alike disqualified for being the criterion of truth. \r Alas, the happenings within Shantytown have a butt-ton of problems to deal with. Starting with the RGB guys, or as I would like to call them, Shuta \"Mr. 24 hero\" Aoi, Ran \"DoRed\" Akagi and Koki \"SARG\" Suido, each of their ambitions are very different, and yet thus serve a different aspect that shows the faction divisions within the ward. The red-haired Ran Akagi is the leader of his graffiti group called DoRed, whom exhibits a strong personality and is able to convey his emotions and feelings through the art of graffiti, which has progressed in the series to be more like a cult following for people opposing the government's radical changes against their will. Together with friends like Kinako, technological hacker Kudo \"Kunai\" Naito, and influencers like Kuchikiri  (better known as 0th) Ran is a force to be reckoned with. The green-haired Koki Suido comes from his familial line of intelligents, with his father Gori being the mayor of the 24th Ward, save for the deceased sister Asumi. Together, they run the 24th Ward with the usual bigotry treatments of fabrications and lies (as you would expect of any governmental system) heralding from the system utilized to keep the ward in their grasp, funded with the help from fellow chief researcher Sakiko \"Satchan\" Tsuzuragawa. And this is so because Koki works in SARG, Shantytown's police faction equivalent to keep harmony within the midst from the likes of Hazard Cast (their version of police surveillance control) and the KANAE System, named after the Suido family's deceased mother (which is an upgraded feature that severely limits privacy in exchange for security) through phones specially supplied to and heavily controlled in the ward, known as cPhones. The blue-haired Shuta Aoi, he's your typical neighbourhood boy with a childish ambition to match, and is the one that always knocks time off around with the people of Shantytown, doing the regular work that's just like the normal average layman. Together with Mari Sakuragi whom manages the 24th Ward's popular okonomiyaki restaurant \"Itadaki\", Shuta is the most average person alive whom has a good side to him being of childlike wonder, yet scramble to action when the Visions occur because he finds it to be a recurring dilemma of choice, because he is known as Mr. 24 the hero of Shantytown, and he wouldn't want anyone dying right in front of his eyes to befall emotional curses upon himself. \r The other characters ploughing through this wonky series, it's sad but obvious to say that they're nothing more than plot movers, because where else would you concoct characters that only have ulterior motives, only to scrap them when their duties are done. Guess this shows that character dynamics are essential, yet when executed wrongly, can become the most glaring of issues to question why does \"this and that\" characters need to be around to begin with. A very hard pass on having too many characters to reflect the adage of \"too many cooks spoil the broth\". \r By now, you should've known the terror that is the behind-the-scenes production woes at CloverWorks, and probably already guessed it by now: the Wonder Egg Priority curse has struck again. In case you didn't know, in Japan, it's prohibited for staff to share what's going on with the production of shows, think of it as like NDAs. But yet above all, one person did: chief animation director Kiminori Itou, whose pessimistic troubles were so rampant enough that he literally documented, chronicled and shared the events leading up to release on his Twitter account. Starting way back last year on October 24th when the anime was officially announced (and mind you, that was after announcements for both Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi's Sailor Uniform), the staff only literally had 2 months (give and take) to create, make and finish the entire production, even if it meant that they had to outsource animators to finish up the job. To put things into perspective, Episode 1 (the double-length premiere) was only completed in the nick of time before the TV broadcast. What resulted in all of that was inconsistent animation, visuals that look nice but was hampered to the point of overlays (the RGB guys displayed many instances of overlay visuals), and though the CloverWorks name is attached to it, the perception that the Wonder Egg Priority curse had already taken over the entire anime in general was already realized even before we the audience actually got to see Episode 1 in the flesh. Yikes, what a mess. \r Of all the bad occurences in this show, there is some sliver of hope, and although the musical function is decent, I just can't feel it with so much dialogue and information being pushed down to our throats. All I can say that the OP is great, and come on, it's the same J-Pop band that brought you Vinland Saga's 1st OP. Survive Said The Prophet never misses, and shows their pedigree here. The ED's title references the RGB colour codes in unison to the RGB MCs, though the song is a bit on the meh side. \r When all is said and done, even after taking everything into consideration, music alone can't really save the entire hectic production that leaves people to having tireless crunch and overwork, it's just so inhumane to see this, but this is the life of the anime industry in Japan, and there's no way to salvage this practice for years to come (that's why we advocate KyoAni in a different light, geddit?). Whatever the reason here, if Wonder Egg Priority was a showcase that if not taken severely enough, then Tokyo 24-ku is the next work to point a finger at both CloverWorks and Aniplex on a practice so deadly that it could cost people their lives and precious time wasted. And this is a protest that the anime industry will not listen to, because it's quantity over quality, and money is the root of all evil. \r So there you have it: the classic case of greedy corporations at the oversight of quality, that rather of Tokyo 24-ku as a standalone show telling its own internal side of the story, there's an external side waiting to be scrutinized and criticized just as hard.

How all these events conspired to turn on their heads, falls on their history growing up in the 24th Ward a.k.a Shantytown as childhood friends with their own typical ambitions in life, being raised in different family backgrounds, hobbies and personalities, with friends being close and typical as family-like. But one event changes everything, and that's when their historic elementary school suffered an arson attack that at first, was thought to be a rando terrorist attack, but it was insignificant things like rats nibbling on old wiring that caused the school to catch fire, and that someone was Koki's younger sister Asumi whom was caught in the flames, the causal effect to lose her life. Asumi is close to the RGB boys, in fact, she'd call them as such to signify their closeness, but with her death, she is seemingly not done yet as her tentative soul lives through phone calls to the RGB guys to present to them the trolley problems known as \"Visions\", though for what purpose remains to be seen in the beginning, that slowly begins to unravel the ugliness that's harnessing those \"Visions\" and the very things that make up the special district of the 24th Ward. \r So first off, I mentioned that you do not need to have a big brain to understand this show, because at hindsight, these trolley problems or \"Visions\" start out as being 2-way choices of limiting innocent deaths by the count. But as time progresses, the Visions get progressively more nuanced, taking into accounts of the nihilistic nature of human radical behaviours from the likes of utilitarianism, altruism and consequentialism, that despite the descriptions of the trolley problem at hand, raises the stakes that would always result in a win-lose situation. And this is where the mysterious Carneades comes in to thwart the RGB guys, thereby raising the stakes higher that death is imminent for at least an innocent being despite the choices that they make. This is pretty significant because Carneades (in history) is known as an academic skeptic, whom holds the belief that all knowledge is impossible a.k.a acatalepsy (meaning \"inability to comprehend\", incomprehensibleness, or the impossibility of comprehending or conceiving a thing), except for the knowledge that all other knowledge is impossible, that human knowledge never amounts to certainty, but only to plausibility. On the basis of truth, Carneades argues that if there were a criterion, it must exist either in reason (logos), sensation (aisth\u00easis), or conception (phantasia). But then reason itself depends on conception, and this again on sensation; have no means of judging whether humans' sensations are true or false, whether they correspond to the objects that produce them, or carry wrong impressions to the mind, producing false conceptions and ideas, and leading reason also into error. Therefore, sensation, conception, and reason, are alike disqualified for being the criterion of truth. \r Alas, the happenings within Shantytown have a butt-ton of problems to deal with. Starting with the RGB guys, or as I would like to call them, Shuta \"Mr. 24 hero\" Aoi, Ran \"DoRed\" Akagi and Koki \"SARG\" Suido, each of their ambitions are very different, and yet thus serve a different aspect that shows the faction divisions within the ward. The red-haired Ran Akagi is the leader of his graffiti group called DoRed, whom exhibits a strong personality and is able to convey his emotions and feelings through the art of graffiti, which has progressed in the series to be more like a cult following for people opposing the government's radical changes against their will. Together with friends like Kinako, technological hacker Kudo \"Kunai\" Naito, and influencers like Kuchikiri  (better known as 0th) Ran is a force to be reckoned with. The green-haired Koki Suido comes from his familial line of intelligents, with his father Gori being the mayor of the 24th Ward, save for the deceased sister Asumi. Together, they run the 24th Ward with the usual bigotry treatments of fabrications and lies (as you would expect of any governmental system) heralding from the system utilized to keep the ward in their grasp, funded with the help from fellow chief researcher Sakiko \"Satchan\" Tsuzuragawa. And this is so because Koki works in SARG, Shantytown's police faction equivalent to keep harmony within the midst from the likes of Hazard Cast (their version of police surveillance control) and the KANAE System, named after the Suido family's deceased mother (which is an upgraded feature that severely limits privacy in exchange for security) through phones specially supplied to and heavily controlled in the ward, known as cPhones. The blue-haired Shuta Aoi, he's your typical neighbourhood boy with a childish ambition to match, and is the one that always knocks time off around with the people of Shantytown, doing the regular work that's just like the normal average layman. Together with Mari Sakuragi whom manages the 24th Ward's popular okonomiyaki restaurant \"Itadaki\", Shuta is the most average person alive whom has a good side to him being of childlike wonder, yet scramble to action when the Visions occur because he finds it to be a recurring dilemma of choice, because he is known as Mr. 24 the hero of Shantytown, and he wouldn't want anyone dying right in front of his eyes to befall emotional curses upon himself. \r The other characters ploughing through this wonky series, it's sad but obvious to say that they're nothing more than plot movers, because where else would you concoct characters that only have ulterior motives, only to scrap them when their duties are done. Guess this shows that character dynamics are essential, yet when executed wrongly, can become the most glaring of issues to question why does \"this and that\" characters need to be around to begin with. A very hard pass on having too many characters to reflect the adage of \"too many cooks spoil the broth\". \r By now, you should've known the terror that is the behind-the-scenes production woes at CloverWorks, and probably already guessed it by now: the Wonder Egg Priority curse has struck again. In case you didn't know, in Japan, it's prohibited for staff to share what's going on with the production of shows, think of it as like NDAs. But yet above all, one person did: chief animation director Kiminori Itou, whose pessimistic troubles were so rampant enough that he literally documented, chronicled and shared the events leading up to release on his Twitter account. Starting way back last year on October 24th when the anime was officially announced (and mind you, that was after announcements for both Sono Bisque Doll and Akebi's Sailor Uniform), the staff only literally had 2 months (give and take) to create, make and finish the entire production, even if it meant that they had to outsource animators to finish up the job. To put things into perspective, Episode 1 (the double-length premiere) was only completed in the nick of time before the TV broadcast. What resulted in all of that was inconsistent animation, visuals that look nice but was hampered to the point of overlays (the RGB guys displayed many instances of overlay visuals), and though the CloverWorks name is attached to it, the perception that the Wonder Egg Priority curse had already taken over the entire anime in general was already realized even before we the audience actually got to see Episode 1 in the flesh. Yikes, what a mess. \r Of all the bad occurences in this show, there is some sliver of hope, and although the musical function is decent, I just can't feel it with so much dialogue and information being pushed down to our throats. All I can say that the OP is great, and come on, it's the same J-Pop band that brought you Vinland Saga's 1st OP. Survive Said The Prophet never misses, and shows their pedigree here. The ED's title references the RGB colour codes in unison to the RGB MCs, though the song is a bit on the meh side. \r When all is said and done, even after taking everything into consideration, music alone can't really save the entire hectic production that leaves people to having tireless crunch and overwork, it's just so inhumane to see this, but this is the life of the anime industry in Japan, and there's no way to salvage this practice for years to come (that's why we advocate KyoAni in a different light, geddit?). Whatever the reason here, if Wonder Egg Priority was a showcase that if not taken severely enough, then Tokyo 24-ku is the next work to point a finger at both CloverWorks and Aniplex on a practice so deadly that it could cost people their lives and precious time wasted. And this is a protest that the anime industry will not listen to, because it's quantity over quality, and money is the root of all evil. \r So there you have it: the classic case of greedy corporations at the oversight of quality, that rather of Tokyo 24-ku as a standalone show telling its own internal side of the story, there's an external side waiting to be scrutinized and criticized just as hard. What a shame, really.

This is the story of Tokyo 24-ku a.k.a Tokyo 24th Ward, brought to you by CloverWorks, the studio now infamous for the \"3 shows per season lineup\" moniker that the Black Sheep of the season has to suffer inherent problems, and this show is that Black Sheep of blame. \r Let's start by laying the groundwork for this show: directed by Jojo director Naokatsu Tsuda, with scriptwriter and series composer Vio Shimokura from Nitroplus (the company responsible for churning out visual novel games, created from writers like the acclaimed Gen Urobuchi), Tokyo 24-ku can be summed with these words alone: groupism, artificial intelligence, altruism, utilitarianism, individualism, consequentialism, principle of double effect. But the most important aspect of how Tokyo 24-ku works is by this barreling issue called the \"trolley problem\", first invented and accounted in a 1967 philosophy paper by English philosopher Philippa Ruth Foot, one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics that are inspired by Aristotle, along with fellow philosophist Judith Jarvis Thomson. \r To understand Tokyo 24-ku, you need to understand what is this \"trolley problem\" all about. This thought experiment is described as such: a series of thought experiments in ethics and psychology, involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number, that usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track.
