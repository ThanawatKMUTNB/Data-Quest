                     It's a very good anime and the story is very very excellent and saying it's just good is like an insult, the art is pretty good considering this anime is in 2007 and the characters are very well made and the more you know their story, the more you like the character even if they are an enemy of the main character, my enjoyment on this anime is really over the top and I really get to feel the burden and accomplishment of the main character, the sound of this anime is just fair, overall this anime really makes you really feel like a contractor with remuneration.

                     I love this show, it comes in my top 5 of the season! but the problem is this may not appeal much to the younger crowd, that is the only reason I think this is rated so low. \r Power Rangers, Gojira, samurai Kenshin's, old jap superhero shows if any of these, this show is gonna be a great nostalgia trip. But that s not all of It,\r It does the fanservice the right way, the nostalgia trip is great and also has a mildly cohesive story on work-life culture and a good moral. \r The characters are best left experienced by oneself hence I won't mention them. \r This is seriously something that is for the child that still remains in all of us.\r Now the animation may not be the best but the fights are done exactly how you'd remember them from your favorite shows, the character art is awesome and is a great throwback to the villains of yesteryears, the heroes are all REAL people! there was just so much love poured into this show which I sadly feel is being overlooked. \r this is a very niche anime, I know many will not be very blown away by this one  \r Yet those who have been a long time fans of the old Japanese shows are sure to fall in love with the great recreations of the most memorable kaijin and heroes that we miss so much , a definite recommendation if you are into  stuff like that!

                 Tokusatsu anime are in general a pretty rare thing, and as a somewhat casual fan of the medium this caught my interest. Add on to that a show that actually shows the perspective of the typical evil group of monsters found in toku shows with a female mc from a comedic perspective? Conceptually it\u2019s brilliant, but execution of it is\u2026actually pretty decently good and surprised me in a few ways. Whether you\u2019re a comedy or toku fan, there\u2019s a pretty enjoyable show here. \r The story is relatively simple enough. Kuriotsu is a researcher in the monster development department at the secret, evil corporation of Agastia. It\u2019s her job along with the main head of the department Shinya to create various monsters to tackle our hero of the story, Blader. Of course being a comedy, the story leans heavily into parodying the genre applying real life work culture, budgets, deadlines, etc. to making these monsters, which is in part where some of the humor comes from. The story doesn\u2019t just follow her though, you\u2019ll see side stories following some of the various monsters, a couple of magical girls that treat it more as a job than actual heroics, a girl just trying to live paycheck to paycheck via being a costumed goon for hire for various toku villains that aren\u2019t Agastia, etc. Blader himself gets a good amount of focus too of course being the main hero, and even he has to work a 2nd job to make ends meet on top of being a hero in almost a Spiderman-esque situation.  \r One minor note, I will say is that the series is full of references and cameos of various toku series both popular and niche. You get anything from Ultraseven being the narrator of one episode, or various animated appearances of real toku chars/heroes that are on air in Japan. You don\u2019t need to know any of this stuff and the series certainly doesn\u2019t rely on fanservice to be successful, but it\u2019s a nice extra thing to have for hardcore toku fans. \r As a comedy, I found the jokes to be kinda hit or miss. I did enjoy the series overall as it doesn\u2019t just rely on comedy, but the actual jokes sometimes rely too much on common anime tropes. There\u2019s a solid dozen boob jokes in the series, and the milage you get out of Wolf\u2019s whole running gag of having a guy brain but being in a girl\u2019s body may vary. Largely, I don\u2019t care about that kinda humor, but they\u2019re not the only type of jokes the series does. The parts that did hit often were the parody of toku tropes, office humor, or just various one off gags that worked well.  \r Something that did surprise me about this show was that it actually has a good level of worldbuilding. It explores considerably how society looks at monsters and how both Agastia and other evil corporations operate in the world, but never to the point it felt too serious, dark, or nonsensical. Y\u2019know how I mentioned how the show doesn\u2019t just focus on Kuriotsu and Blader? Well yeah, often those parts of the eps that focus on the other chars help flesh out the world, and I\u2019d say it makes the series as a whole more appealing.  \r The characterization is good enough. There\u2019s definitely better characterization in comedies out there, but you\u2019ll still find a likable cast here. Kuriotsu is a determined young woman, and honestly one of the better female protags I\u2019ve seen in anime. She\u2019s got great leadership skills, looks out for her fellow employees/comrades, is actually pretty strong combat wise, has plenty of tenacity, but still has a cute, relatable side to her. Wolfy is to an extent the deuteragonist of the series, but they have similar qualities to Kuriotsu with a somewhat more aggressive, tsundere side to them. The side cast in general gets alright development, outside of a few I\u2019d say barely any are just one note chars that are just there for some gag. Blader himself gets a good amount of development too, though I\u2019d say it\u2019s sort of just your usual shonen mc development. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say its anything unique, outside of him technically being the antagonist.  \r Animation wise, the show is above average. Characters are certainly expressive, and the visual gags hit well. Otherwise though, I\u2019d say the animation is comparable to your average isekai. I guess one highlight is that I recall there being pretty much no or barely any CGI, so I guess that\u2019s one positive. I think the character designs in general are pretty strong, even if some of the faces on the girls look a bit samey.  \r Voice acting is fine, I don\u2019t have any complaints here. Standard acting for these sort of comedies. Music I actually quite enjoyed. The OP is bombastic and gets you into the action, and you get 2 EDs one being a hotblooded theme song for Blader, and the other just being a silly ED about Kuriotsu. The general soundtrack I liked, but didn\u2019t feel was very memorable. \r Overall, this was a good show. I wouldn\u2019t call it great, but again I think it's highly enjoyable as a toku fan, and still a nice watch for comedy fans. Solid 7/10 series.

Add on to that a show that actually shows the perspective of the typical evil group of monsters found in toku shows with a female mc from a comedic perspective? Conceptually it\u2019s brilliant, but execution of it is\u2026actually pretty decently good and surprised me in a few ways. Whether you\u2019re a comedy or toku fan, there\u2019s a pretty enjoyable show here. \r The story is relatively simple enough. Kuriotsu is a researcher in the monster development department at the secret, evil corporation of Agastia. It\u2019s her job along with the main head of the department Shinya to create various monsters to tackle our hero of the story, Blader. Of course being a comedy, the story leans heavily into parodying the genre applying real life work culture, budgets, deadlines, etc. to making these monsters, which is in part where some of the humor comes from. The story doesn\u2019t just follow her though, you\u2019ll see side stories following some of the various monsters, a couple of magical girls that treat it more as a job than actual heroics, a girl just trying to live paycheck to paycheck via being a costumed goon for hire for various toku villains that aren\u2019t Agastia, etc. Blader himself gets a good amount of focus too of course being the main hero, and even he has to work a 2nd job to make ends meet on top of being a hero in almost a Spiderman-esque situation.  \r One minor note, I will say is that the series is full of references and cameos of various toku series both popular and niche. You get anything from Ultraseven being the narrator of one episode, or various animated appearances of real toku chars/heroes that are on air in Japan. You don\u2019t need to know any of this stuff and the series certainly doesn\u2019t rely on fanservice to be successful, but it\u2019s a nice extra thing to have for hardcore toku fans. \r As a comedy, I found the jokes to be kinda hit or miss. I did enjoy the series overall as it doesn\u2019t just rely on comedy, but the actual jokes sometimes rely too much on common anime tropes. There\u2019s a solid dozen boob jokes in the series, and the milage you get out of Wolf\u2019s whole running gag of having a guy brain but being in a girl\u2019s body may vary. Largely, I don\u2019t care about that kinda humor, but they\u2019re not the only type of jokes the series does. The parts that did hit often were the parody of toku tropes, office humor, or just various one off gags that worked well.  \r Something that did surprise me about this show was that it actually has a good level of worldbuilding. It explores considerably how society looks at monsters and how both Agastia and other evil corporations operate in the world, but never to the point it felt too serious, dark, or nonsensical. Y\u2019know how I mentioned how the show doesn\u2019t just focus on Kuriotsu and Blader? Well yeah, often those parts of the eps that focus on the other chars help flesh out the world, and I\u2019d say it makes the series as a whole more appealing.  \r The characterization is good enough. There\u2019s definitely better characterization in comedies out there, but you\u2019ll still find a likable cast here. Kuriotsu is a determined young woman, and honestly one of the better female protags I\u2019ve seen in anime. She\u2019s got great leadership skills, looks out for her fellow employees/comrades, is actually pretty strong combat wise, has plenty of tenacity, but still has a cute, relatable side to her. Wolfy is to an extent the deuteragonist of the series, but they have similar qualities to Kuriotsu with a somewhat more aggressive, tsundere side to them. The side cast in general gets alright development, outside of a few I\u2019d say barely any are just one note chars that are just there for some gag. Blader himself gets a good amount of development too, though I\u2019d say it\u2019s sort of just your usual shonen mc development. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d say its anything unique, outside of him technically being the antagonist.  \r Animation wise, the show is above average. Characters are certainly expressive, and the visual gags hit well. Otherwise though, I\u2019d say the animation is comparable to your average isekai. I guess one highlight is that I recall there being pretty much no or barely any CGI, so I guess that\u2019s one positive. I think the character designs in general are pretty strong, even if some of the faces on the girls look a bit samey.  \r Voice acting is fine, I don\u2019t have any complaints here. Standard acting for these sort of comedies. Music I actually quite enjoyed. The OP is bombastic and gets you into the action, and you get 2 EDs one being a hotblooded theme song for Blader, and the other just being a silly ED about Kuriotsu. The general soundtrack I liked, but didn\u2019t feel was very memorable. \r Overall, this was a good show.
