              Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is another power-fantasy isekai which takes a highly interesting premise and squanders it with bad writing and shallow characters.  \r At the beginning of the show, our protagonist is some no-name, 37-year-old virgin salary man who gets inexplicably killed in the real world. He reincarnates in a generic fantasy world, but with the added twist that he is a slime - a monster commonly known for being extremely weak. He takes the name Rimuru. Oh, and he also gets the \"extra skill\" Great Sage, which will ensure he has absolutely no trouble with any sort of obstacle or adversity in the future. \r As the story progresses, Rimuru's path to omnipotent power quickly becomes apparent. He can also absorb and analyze things to learn new powers and he can use Great Sage to combine and decompose skills to learn new, unique powers. So right off the bat, Rimuru has the endless potential to use his powers to steal others and create new powers. This might be interesting if the author would at least challenge our protagonist with some life or death battles, but that idea is immediately squashed.  \r In Rimuru's first real fight, he saves some goblins from some Direwolves without breaking a sweat. The battle ends when Rimuru kills the Direwolf chief, demoralizing the rest of the pack. Inexplicably, the son of the chief Direwolf decides to become Rimuru's loyal lapdog because.... reasons? And the issue is never explored any further. The Goblins Rimuru saved also decide to become loyal followers. Rimuru then discovers he can name these monsters which gives them all a free power boost at the expense of making him a little bit tired. Convenient. As a result, by the end of the first episode our slime has a small army of powered-up monsters who are doggedly loyal to him.  \r As the series progresses, the plot never really changes from the basic formula in the first episode. Rimuru or his henchmen encounter a new big bad, the big bad gets a big scary name like World Calamity or Orc Disaster, then Rimuru shows up and destroys the threat in about 3 seconds using various overpowered abilities he gained from his last fight. Rinse and repeat. All along the way, Rimuru is absorbing his opponents and becoming even more unbeatable. \r An Isekai wouldn't be complete without a generic harem, and this show has it in spades. The show tries to distract from the boring story with a parade of beautiful women, all of whom love Rimuru for no particular reason. Rimuru spends most of the show being used as a breast-rest for a particularly buxom Ogre. This could be endearing or even funny, but the show makes no attempts at developing any kind of real relationship with any of the women, nor does it have the self-awareness to poke fun at the absurd relationship. Rimuru's personality is the same copy-paste, bland Isekai protagonist from every other show. His only real \"personality trait\" is being a cute little slime - sometimes.  \r And that brings us to the biggest issue with this show. Rimuru is supposed to be a slime. That is an extremely interesting premise which could be explored in so many ways, but it never goes anywhere. Within the first few episodes, Rimuru has already gained a human form. He spends most of his time in this form. This happens so early in the series, he might as well not be a slime. There is no challenge to being in the world as a slime since he can just walk among humans. He doesn't even use any special human/slime hybrid fighting style that could be interesting to watch. No, instead he just fires off magical explosions or uses his OP \"Gluttony\" ability to create a void vacuum which eats just about everything. Every single aspect of the plot that could be interesting is ignored, glossed over, or completely skipped. Every battle presents zero real challenge and serve as little more than an opportunity to show how awesome Rimuru is. \r Story: (3/10)\r Literally every interesting concept or situation is immediately resolved. Rimuru has extremely nebulous goals of building a monster-friendly town and is somehow wildly successful despite having been a 37-year-old salaryman in his previous life. Everything Rimuru could ever want or need just falls into his lap, whether it is power, a harem, a town, a demon lord... whatever. That might be fine if this show was slice-of-life or comedy, but it's not. The show is only funny if you can laugh at how absurd it is. There is literally a part where a woman infiltrates Rimuru's town and sets up a barrier that causes hundreds of innocent people to die. It turns out she was under another demon lord's control, but she was never actually forced to do it. She created the barrier, knowing it would cause hundreds of innocent people to die, in order to (maybe) save her own life. Rimuru briefly considers getting revenge on her, but then chooses not to. Rimuru not only doesn't take revenge, he doesn't even arrest her. Instead, she's allowed to sit at the strategy table while they make plans to fight back. Rimuru then saves her life and lets her walk around freely based on the extremely small chance that he can resurrect everyone who died and right her wrongs. Oh, and his method for resurrecting those who died? Yea, just slaughtering tens of thousands of human soldiers. So Rimuru can't kill the agent of another nation who directly caused hundreds of his people to die, but he slaughter tens of thousands of people in an opposing army on the small chance that it may resurrect his people. Makes complete sense. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the enemy agent being a waifu. \r Art: (7/10)\r The Art is generally good throughout the show. There is some wonky 3D moments with the large army battles. There is also some clear quality issues in a few scenes in the second season. \r Sound: (7/10)\r I don't really pay attention to sound. It was OK.  \r Characters: (3/10)\r I would have given this a 1/10 if not for Veldora and Milim Nava having some genuinely funny moments. They were the sole redeeming characters in the show. Everyone else is extremely flat, boring, walking stereotypes. The characters show no real emotions and completely unnatural reactions. From the first episode where the son of the direwolf chief sees his father die and immediately forgets about it to join Rimuru, to the middle of the season when the King of the Dwarves continues to talk down to Rimuru as if he is not an all-powerful demon lord running his own nation. Every interaction is completely absurd and not in a funny way.  \r Enjoyment: (2/10)\r It helped put me to sleep every night for about two weeks.

This could be endearing or even funny, but the show makes no attempts at developing any kind of real relationship with any of the women, nor does it have the self-awareness to poke fun at the absurd relationship. Rimuru's personality is the same copy-paste, bland Isekai protagonist from every other show. His only real \"personality trait\" is being a cute little slime - sometimes.  \r And that brings us to the biggest issue with this show. Rimuru is supposed to be a slime. That is an extremely interesting premise which could be explored in so many ways, but it never goes anywhere. Within the first few episodes, Rimuru has already gained a human form. He spends most of his time in this form. This happens so early in the series, he might as well not be a slime. There is no challenge to being in the world as a slime since he can just walk among humans. He doesn't even use any special human/slime hybrid fighting style that could be interesting to watch. No, instead he just fires off magical explosions or uses his OP \"Gluttony\" ability to create a void vacuum which eats just about everything. Every single aspect of the plot that could be interesting is ignored, glossed over, or completely skipped. Every battle presents zero real challenge and serve as little more than an opportunity to show how awesome Rimuru is. \r Story: (3/10)\r Literally every interesting concept or situation is immediately resolved. Rimuru has extremely nebulous goals of building a monster-friendly town and is somehow wildly successful despite having been a 37-year-old salaryman in his previous life. Everything Rimuru could ever want or need just falls into his lap, whether it is power, a harem, a town, a demon lord... whatever. That might be fine if this show was slice-of-life or comedy, but it's not. The show is only funny if you can laugh at how absurd it is. There is literally a part where a woman infiltrates Rimuru's town and sets up a barrier that causes hundreds of innocent people to die. It turns out she was under another demon lord's control, but she was never actually forced to do it. She created the barrier, knowing it would cause hundreds of innocent people to die, in order to (maybe) save her own life. Rimuru briefly considers getting revenge on her, but then chooses not to. Rimuru not only doesn't take revenge, he doesn't even arrest her. Instead, she's allowed to sit at the strategy table while they make plans to fight back. Rimuru then saves her life and lets her walk around freely based on the extremely small chance that he can resurrect everyone who died and right her wrongs. Oh, and his method for resurrecting those who died? Yea, just slaughtering tens of thousands of human soldiers. So Rimuru can't kill the agent of another nation who directly caused hundreds of his people to die, but he slaughter tens of thousands of people in an opposing army on the small chance that it may resurrect his people. Makes complete sense. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the enemy agent being a waifu. \r Art: (7/10)\r The Art is generally good throughout the show. There is some wonky 3D moments with the large army battles. There is also some clear quality issues in a few scenes in the second season. \r Sound: (7/10)\r I don't really pay attention to sound. It was OK.  \r Characters: (3/10)\r I would have given this a 1/10 if not for Veldora and Milim Nava having some genuinely funny moments. They were the sole redeeming characters in the show. Everyone else is extremely flat, boring, walking stereotypes. The characters show no real emotions and completely unnatural reactions. From the first episode where the son of the direwolf chief sees his father die and immediately forgets about it to join Rimuru, to the middle of the season when the King of the Dwarves continues to talk down to Rimuru as if he is not an all-powerful demon lord running his own nation. Every interaction is completely absurd and not in a funny way.  \r Enjoyment: (2/10)\r It helped put me to sleep every night for about two weeks.

He reincarnates in a generic fantasy world, but with the added twist that he is a slime - a monster commonly known for being extremely weak. He takes the name Rimuru. Oh, and he also gets the \"extra skill\" Great Sage, which will ensure he has absolutely no trouble with any sort of obstacle or adversity in the future. \r As the story progresses, Rimuru's path to omnipotent power quickly becomes apparent. He can also absorb and analyze things to learn new powers and he can use Great Sage to combine and decompose skills to learn new, unique powers. So right off the bat, Rimuru has the endless potential to use his powers to steal others and create new powers. This might be interesting if the author would at least challenge our protagonist with some life or death battles, but that idea is immediately squashed.  \r In Rimuru's first real fight, he saves some goblins from some Direwolves without breaking a sweat. The battle ends when Rimuru kills the Direwolf chief, demoralizing the rest of the pack. Inexplicably, the son of the chief Direwolf decides to become Rimuru's loyal lapdog because.... reasons? And the issue is never explored any further. The Goblins Rimuru saved also decide to become loyal followers. Rimuru then discovers he can name these monsters which gives them all a free power boost at the expense of making him a little bit tired. Convenient. As a result, by the end of the first episode our slime has a small army of powered-up monsters who are doggedly loyal to him.  \r As the series progresses, the plot never really changes from the basic formula in the first episode. Rimuru or his henchmen encounter a new big bad, the big bad gets a big scary name like World Calamity or Orc Disaster, then Rimuru shows up and destroys the threat in about 3 seconds using various overpowered abilities he gained from his last fight. Rinse and repeat. All along the way, Rimuru is absorbing his opponents and becoming even more unbeatable. \r An Isekai wouldn't be complete without a generic harem, and this show has it in spades. The show tries to distract from the boring story with a parade of beautiful women, all of whom love Rimuru for no particular reason. Rimuru spends most of the show being used as a breast-rest for a particularly buxom Ogre.

some of my impressions of Tamako Market (mostly the show, but I do know how the movie ends so that might factor into my commentary here) **Some spoilers!**  \r I started Tamako Market initially because it was KyoAni and had the same character designs as K-On!, so I figured it was sure to be cute at least. And right away, something about it pulled me in. It reminded me, in a strange way, of the Soviet-era cartoons my mother showed me when I was little: a talking bird from a southern island, a plot with a prince seeking out a princess\u2026even though everything surrounding Tamako Market, its main setting, is completely Japanese (you could argue that the profession of making mochi is one of the most Japanese ones out there), was completely relatable to me. The warm, homey feeling of the market transmitted itself to me and made me feel at home just watching it all on a screen. \r This anime is a story about a community, leaving aside the princess plot, and about the new generation growing up within it. Even if a lot of it might seem like cute, simple fluff, it\u2019s fluff with heart. All of the characters are so loveable that you just want to root them on (even comic relief Dera). I will say that I wish Choi\u2019s story had gotten more resolution without being moved to shorts/pre-movie scenes because her romance was kinda skimmed over. But in its place came the much stronger development of an unexpectedly progressive love triangle. \r As a dense 14-year-old on my first watch of the show, I completely and totally mistook those scenes of Midori\u2019s crush as her liking Mochizou (admittedly, this is because I had a massive crush on him myself at the time, and still think he\u2019s the cutest love interest ever). But after being educated on who Midori actually liked, I realized that her romantic interest in Tamako is never depicted as a bad thing or something she comes to grow out of, but with sweetness and care and sensitivity. Her love is just as valid as Mochizou\u2019s love for Tamako. The show revolves around \u201ceverybody loves somebody\u201d as its mantra, and that doesn\u2019t mean that love should fit some kind of predetermined standard or societal norm. I also thought it was refreshing that Kanna was just doing her own thing the entire time and not given any romance, but that\u2019s a whole other thing. Even if Midori\u2019s crush doesn\u2019t end up progressing past that stage, it\u2019s never knocked down or disparaged, it\u2019s simply a one-sided love. This is the kind of love triangle (love V?) that had me rooting for both sides interested in Tamako. Also, it took a couple rewatches to realize the pun of Mochizou\u2019s last name being Ooji, basically the same as \u201couji\u201d/prince, which means he was Tamako\u2019s prince the entire time. Just a little nod from the writers there, I guess. \r I think more people can articulate better than I can why Tamako Market is an exemplary slice of life, and my review here is mostly a summary of my strongest impressions after having rewatched it a few times over the years. But that warm, welcome, accepting feeling that I get from it every time, that\u2019s something that I don\u2019t think this review alone can speak to. It might just be me, but Tamako Market is one of KyoAni\u2019s stronger examples of making an extremely atmospheric and real-feeling world that, in the strangest way, coexists alongside talking birds and southern island kingdoms in the same 12 episodes.

And right away, something about it pulled me in. It reminded me, in a strange way, of the Soviet-era cartoons my mother showed me when I was little: a talking bird from a southern island, a plot with a prince seeking out a princess\u2026even though everything surrounding Tamako Market, its main setting, is completely Japanese (you could argue that the profession of making mochi is one of the most Japanese ones out there), was completely relatable to me. The warm, homey feeling of the market transmitted itself to me and made me feel at home just watching it all on a screen. \r This anime is a story about a community, leaving aside the princess plot, and about the new generation growing up within it. Even if a lot of it might seem like cute, simple fluff, it\u2019s fluff with heart. All of the characters are so loveable that you just want to root them on (even comic relief Dera). I will say that I wish Choi\u2019s story had gotten more resolution without being moved to shorts/pre-movie scenes because her romance was kinda skimmed over. But in its place came the much stronger development of an unexpectedly progressive love triangle. \r As a dense 14-year-old on my first watch of the show, I completely and totally mistook those scenes of Midori\u2019s crush as her liking Mochizou (admittedly, this is because I had a massive crush on him myself at the time, and still think he\u2019s the cutest love interest ever). But after being educated on who Midori actually liked, I realized that her romantic interest in Tamako is never depicted as a bad thing or something she comes to grow out of, but with sweetness and care and sensitivity. Her love is just as valid as Mochizou\u2019s love for Tamako. The show revolves around \u201ceverybody loves somebody\u201d as its mantra, and that doesn\u2019t mean that love should fit some kind of predetermined standard or societal norm. I also thought it was refreshing that Kanna was just doing her own thing the entire time and not given any romance, but that\u2019s a whole other thing. Even if Midori\u2019s crush doesn\u2019t end up progressing past that stage, it\u2019s never knocked down or disparaged, it\u2019s simply a one-sided love. This is the kind of love triangle (love V?) that had me rooting for both sides interested in Tamako. Also, it took a couple rewatches to realize the pun of Mochizou\u2019s last name being Ooji, basically the same as \u201couji\u201d/prince, which means he was Tamako\u2019s prince the entire time.

     In Praise of Shin Sekai Yori (spoiler-free)  \r It\u2019s been nearly ten years since this anime aired and already since the pandemic started I\u2019ve rewatched it twice, the second time with a family member who never really watches anime, and still enjoyed it just as much as when I first saw it. Why? \r I first discovered this show when I was a couple of years older than the characters in the second arc (going on 16 at the time) and I\u2019m writing this years later, having bought all three of the novels, downloaded the soundtrack, and rewatched it enough times to practically have it memorized. To be honest, I\u2019m not actually sure why I decided to watch it in the first place: the cover picture and description on Crunchyroll, probably? But that summer that I picked it up had such an impact on me that I\u2019m so glad I stuck with it. \r An adaptation of an extensively written trio of novels, watching this anime makes me feel like I\u2019ve been immersed in the story completely. The story is one that definitely benefited from being told in an animated format because of the brilliant, eerie world that it\u2019s set in and with all the actors that move among it. Some of the episodes with the wonkier animation still work in my opinion, making some of the most tense scenes even more creepy. Even with timeskips and purposefully misheld information, each episode blends well together into the next, and plot points continue throughout the series for a satisfying sense of continuity. \r I think what\u2019s especially important to note is that, really, Saki is an ordinary protagonist. Her resilience and intelligence are not to be underestimated, but her power as just a regular person is what makes her shine. Perhaps because of the setting and structures of her society, nobody stands out because of their backgrounds or any influence they might have with others, but because of their actions, and Saki\u2019s actions speak for themselves. Say what you will about the other characters/their development, but she\u2019s very dynamic and the story explores her growth in so much depth that she feels like a real person. The worldbuilding is also fascinating and really serves to highlight the themes of the story\u2014you learn about it along with Saki and even though there are info-dumps along the way, they are brought up again later and are actually essential to the story. And it all makes rewatching it that much more fun. \r So if you\u2019d like a break from some of the mainstream anime out there and are looking for a deeper story, I\u2019d definitely recommend this show. To me, it brings a story to the screen in a way not many novel adaptations (even live action ones) do.

Perhaps because of the setting and structures of her society, nobody stands out because of their backgrounds or any influence they might have with others, but because of their actions, and Saki\u2019s actions speak for themselves. Say what you will about the other characters/their development, but she\u2019s very dynamic and the story explores her growth in so much depth that she feels like a real person. The worldbuilding is also fascinating and really serves to highlight the themes of the story\u2014you learn about it along with Saki and even though there are info-dumps along the way, they are brought up again later and are actually essential to the story. And it all makes rewatching it that much more fun. \r So if you\u2019d like a break from some of the mainstream anime out there and are looking for a deeper story, I\u2019d definitely recommend this show. To me, it brings a story to the screen in a way not many novel adaptations (even live action ones) do.
