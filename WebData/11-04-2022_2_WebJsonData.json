Home TV TV News Shang Chi's Simu Liu Critiques Arthur Harrow's Mandarin in Moon Knight    Shang Chi's Simu Liu Critiques Arthur Harrow's Mandarin in Moon Knight  By Narayan Liu Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings star Simu Liu critiques Arthur Harrow's attempt at Mandarin in Disney+'s Moon Knight.                 Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings star Simu Liu has evidently seen Moon Knight and does not approve of actor Ethan Hawke's attempt at speaking Mandarin.  On social media, Liu wrote, \"Alright Arthur Harrow needs to fire his Mandarin teacher.\" This is in reference to Moon Knight's second episode, \"Summon the Suit,\" in which Harrow briefly utters a few phrases in attempted Mandarin to one of his disciples, explaining that each member of their community tries to learn three languages. RELATED: Marvel Fans Are Convinced Moon Knight Dropped the MCU's First F-Bomb      Where Harrow's disciple can be heard saying (roughly translated from Mandarin), \"You're still a loser,\" many Mandarin speakers found Harrow's lines incomprehensible, with some criticizing Marvel Studios, which notably produced Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, for seemingly being unable to provide Hawke with corrections or guidance regarding his pronunciation and tones. There are other significant grammatical errors present in the dialogue. All that being said, it is worth noting Harrow's community simply aims to learn different languages and is not shown to possess any language teachers.  Since Liu was cast as Shang-Chi in the 2021 film, the actor has been vocal about Asian representation in film and television. He previously went so far as to call being Asian his \"superpower.\" He said at the 19th annual Unforgettable Gala, \"There are so many people here tonight fighting the good fight\u2026 showing me what it means to be unapologetically Asian... The more I think about it, the more it feels like a super power.\" He then acknowledged other Asian actors who have been \"fighting this war for representation, for so much longer than I have,\" before urging Asian talent to \"show the world how f**king cool it is to be Asian.\"  RELATED: Marc Spector Isn't the MCU's First Moon Knight The second episode of Moon Knight saw Steven Grant confront his alter, Marc Spector and uncover details of Spector's life-- his past life as a mercenary, his marriage and his deal with the Egyptian moon god, Khonshu. It also marked the first appearance of Mr. Knight, in the show. The alter was shown to be Grant's attempt at summoning the Moon Knight suit, allowing him to possess the strength of the Fist of Khonshu, while also retaining his own mind. However, he was ultimately forced to surrender his body to Marc Spector and Moon Knight, in order to defeat the jackal beast Harrow summoned.  Moon Knight director Mohamed Diab previously spoke about the Mr. Knight suit, revealing that the original plan was to give it to Marc Spector. \"Ironically, we started with Steven having Moon Knight and Marc having Mr. Knight, but that's one of the best things about taking your time and developing things,\" Diab said. \"You start realizing no, no, no, this costume is for this guy. This is what works for them.\" New episodes of Moon Knight are released on Wednesdays on Disney+.

Home Anime Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army    Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army  By Kelvin Kwao Published 4 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   My Hero Academia's Twice is the series' most hilarious villain -- however, his mysterious past is anything but.                 The villains of My Hero Academia are no strangers to conflict, but Bubaigawara Jin, aka Twice, literally couldn't imagine his life without it. Following a tragic accident involving the use of his Double Quirk, Twice had to live with an alter ego in his head, constantly second-guessing his decisions and, at times, even blurting out the opposite of what the villain intended to say. It was a condition that severely hampered his ability to relate to others. However, Twice's troubles began long before.  My Hero Academia goes to great lengths to drive home the point that most of its villains are victims, in some way, of the Quirk-based society: Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk gives her an insatiable thirst for blood; Dabi's vendetta against Endeavor stemmed from the abuse he'd endured as a child. However, among them, there was no greater victim of circumstance than Twice. His foray into villainy wasn't a path he chose, nor was it one he seemed to particularly enjoy, but that was the only path left available to him. RELATED: Near-Forgotten MHA Theory Rises From the Ashes - and Dabi May Do the Same                  Twice had been alone from the beginning. He had no family or friends to rely on for support, and he was destitute once a car accident left him with a criminal record. With no one willing to hire a registered felon, Twice took to petty villainy for survival, and used his Double Quirk to create the community he'd lacked, as well as an infinite number of henchmen. All was well until his clones turned on each other, asserting that each was the original Twice. The sight of many iterations of himself physically harming each other broke something within Twice, and ever since, his strange condition manifested, and he vowed not to use his Quirk in himself ever again.  Despite the terrible cards that life had dealt him, Twice maintained his upbeat view on life, and once he joined the League of Villains, he was ecstatic that he'd made new friends. Being a mentally unstable villain left him with few avenues where he was accepted as he was, so he treasured the League for granting him this new community. He was quite devoted to his friends, and was always eager to prove his usefulness to the team. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 Twice proved his devotion to the League several times over. He never used his Quirk for personal gain, although he was arguably the most powerful member of the team; it formed a valuable tool the League could exploit during its guerrilla raids. When the League was in the greatest danger, during the fight against the Meta-Liberation Army, Twice overcame his fear of doubling himself. In an instant,he created an army to rescue his friends, and in a matter of moments had completely turned the tide against the thousands of Liberation soldiers.  Twice's death occurred in the pursuit of his goal to protect the League. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Hawks cornered him and warned that he'd be forced to take Twice down if he didn't surrender. Undeterred by the threat, Twice continued fighting to protect the League, forcing Hawks to end his life lest Twice trigger another unstoppable Sad Man's Parade. Twice's death, apart from being one of the series most emotional moments, was the first instance a Pro-Hero had been shown using fatal force against a villain. At that moment, the line between hero and villain was blurred, especially since the victim was in the pursuit of a goal that would be described as heroic if he was any of the series' main cast. At his core, Twice was just a man who loved and wished to protect his friends burdened with the mistakes of his past. He was the furthest thing from evil and that made him one of My Hero Academia's most interesting villains.

The villains of My Hero Academia are no strangers to conflict, but Bubaigawara Jin, aka Twice, literally couldn't imagine his life without it. Following a tragic accident involving the use of his Double Quirk, Twice had to live with an alter ego in his head, constantly second-guessing his decisions and, at times, even blurting out the opposite of what the villain intended to say. It was a condition that severely hampered his ability to relate to others. However, Twice's troubles began long before.  My Hero Academia goes to great lengths to drive home the point that most of its villains are victims, in some way, of the Quirk-based society: Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk gives her an insatiable thirst for blood; Dabi's vendetta against Endeavor stemmed from the abuse he'd endured as a child. However, among them, there was no greater victim of circumstance than Twice. His foray into villainy wasn't a path he chose, nor was it one he seemed to particularly enjoy, but that was the only path left available to him. RELATED: Near-Forgotten MHA Theory Rises From the Ashes - and Dabi May Do the Same                  Twice had been alone from the beginning. He had no family or friends to rely on for support, and he was destitute once a car accident left him with a criminal record. With no one willing to hire a registered felon, Twice took to petty villainy for survival, and used his Double Quirk to create the community he'd lacked, as well as an infinite number of henchmen. All was well until his clones turned on each other, asserting that each was the original Twice. The sight of many iterations of himself physically harming each other broke something within Twice, and ever since, his strange condition manifested, and he vowed not to use his Quirk in himself ever again.  Despite the terrible cards that life had dealt him, Twice maintained his upbeat view on life, and once he joined the League of Villains, he was ecstatic that he'd made new friends. Being a mentally unstable villain left him with few avenues where he was accepted as he was, so he treasured the League for granting him this new community. He was quite devoted to his friends, and was always eager to prove his usefulness to the team. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 Twice proved his devotion to the League several times over. He never used his Quirk for personal gain, although he was arguably the most powerful member of the team; it formed a valuable tool the League could exploit during its guerrilla raids. When the League was in the greatest danger, during the fight against the Meta-Liberation Army, Twice overcame his fear of doubling himself. In an instant,he created an army to rescue his friends, and in a matter of moments had completely turned the tide against the thousands of Liberation soldiers.  Twice's death occurred in the pursuit of his goal to protect the League. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Hawks cornered him and warned that he'd be forced to take Twice down if he didn't surrender. Undeterred by the threat, Twice continued fighting to protect the League, forcing Hawks to end his life lest Twice trigger another unstoppable Sad Man's Parade. Twice's death, apart from being one of the series most emotional moments, was the first instance a Pro-Hero had been shown using fatal force against a villain. At that moment, the line between hero and villain was blurred, especially since the victim was in the pursuit of a goal that would be described as heroic if he was any of the series' main cast. At his core, Twice was just a man who loved and wished to protect his friends burdened with the mistakes of his past. He was the furthest thing from evil and that made him one of My Hero Academia's most interesting villains.

Captain Marvel star Brie Larson is joining the Fast & Furious family.  Actor Vin Diesel shared a photo of the two laughing on Instagram, confirming that Larson will be involved in the upcoming Fast & Furious 10. After saying how many fans likely recognize Larson as Captain Marvel, Diesel wrote, \"What you don't see however, is the character you will be introduced to in [Fast & Furious 10].

Beyond her beauty, her intellect... her Oscar, haha is this profound soul who will add something you might not have expected but yearned for.

Though Jakob serves as the film's main antagonist, its story concludes with his redemption after he joins the family to stop his former partner and the cyberterrorist Cipher (Charlize Theron). However, Cipher is still at large by the end of the film. While Larson will be joining the franchise in an undisclosed role, her addition comes after actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson said he would not be returning to the racing saga. The actor made this decision back in July 2021, but Diesel called out on social media for him to reprise his role as Luke Hobbs the following November. The two have feuded during the production of previous Fast & Furious films, and Johnson labeled Diesel's post as another \"example of his manipulation,\" though he wished his former co-stars and crew \"the best of luck and success in the next chapter.\"  RELATED: Vin Diesel Announces F&F 10 Production Start With 'Exciting\u2019 New Cast Members What this chapter will entail remains to be seen, though the films have gone to new levels in recent installments. F9 managed to launch Tej Parker (Ludacris) and Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) into Space, while also including super-conductive magnets, jets and more. In addition to Larson in Fast & Furious 10, Aquaman star Jason Momoa will be playing a new villain for the franchise alongside Theron's Cipher. Another DC Extended Universe star, The Suicide Squad's Daniela Melchior, will also be joining the tenth installment in an undisclosed role.  Fast & Furious 10 is set to release in theaters May 19, 2023.

The actor made this decision back in July 2021, but Diesel called out on social media for him to reprise his role as Luke Hobbs the following November. The two have feuded during the production of previous Fast & Furious films, and Johnson labeled Diesel's post as another \"example of his manipulation,\" though he wished his former co-stars and crew \"the best of luck and success in the next chapter.\"  RELATED: Vin Diesel Announces F&F 10 Production Start With 'Exciting\u2019 New Cast Members What this chapter will entail remains to be seen, though the films have gone to new levels in recent installments. F9 managed to launch Tej Parker (Ludacris) and Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson) into Space, while also including super-conductive magnets, jets and more. In addition to Larson in Fast & Furious 10, Aquaman star Jason Momoa will be playing a new villain for the franchise alongside Theron's Cipher. Another DC Extended Universe star, The Suicide Squad's Daniela Melchior, will also be joining the tenth installment in an undisclosed role.  Fast & Furious 10 is set to release in theaters May 19, 2023.

Home Anime Tiger & Bunny 2\u2019s Kotetsu Sees Himself in a Brand New Hero    Tiger & Bunny 2\u2019s Kotetsu Sees Himself in a Brand New Hero  By Calum Walker Published 19 minutes ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Tiger & Bunny 2's newest hero, Mr. Black, mirrors Kotetsu's own arc from the Season 1 -- something the Wild Tiger is all too aware of in Episode 2.                  The following contains spoilers for Tiger & Bunny 2 Episode 2, \"No One Knows the Weight of Another's Burden,\" now streaming on Netflix.   After a jam-packed season premiere, Tiger & Bunny 2 slows down for its second episode to focus on some of its new characters -- most prominently Subara Sengoku, the barrier-powered superhero Mr. Black.  Before coming to Stern Bild, Sengoku performed superheroics under the alias of ''Hello Goodbye'' in a city called Panjourney alongside two other heroes. After doing well in Stern Bild's superhero hiring exam, he was relocated to the city and his hero name was changed to Mr. Black. However, the difference between his prior hero life and his career in the First League prove to be something of a culture shock for young Sengoku. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Novelizations May Reveal New Premiere Date for Movie                As the lowest-ranked hero in the First League, Sengoku receives pressure from his sponsor and, after missing a mission, the threat of being fired. Sengoku, who became a hero out of a genuine desire to help others, comes to resent the rampant commercialism endemic to Stern Bild's hero culture -- similarly to Kotetsu in Season 1.  While Sengoku receives the brunt of this episode's focus, his partner receives some additional development as well. It's made clear that Thomas Taurus is considered a prodigy among the new batch of heroes, to the extent that Sengoku is asked to be little more than his backup. Sengoku interrogates his fellow First Leaguers' motivations for becoming heroes in the first place, including Thomas'. While Thomas insists he only became one because he ''felt like it'', a quick flashback to an incident from his past reveals this isn't the case. No doubt a later Tiger & Bunny 2 episode will shine a light on what happened to young Thomas to actually make him a hero.  RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                As Kotetsu asks Agnes about Black, it's clear the veteran hero sees himself in the rookie. During Episode 2's climactic mission to stop a drug lord, Sengoku, afraid of being overshadowed by Thomas, tries to take the spotlight all for himself -- blowing Origami Cyclone's cover in the process. While the heroes manage to salvage the mission, they chew out Sengoku for his mistake. He admits he was afraid of being stuck in Thomas' shadow but Kotetsu appeals to his better nature, reassuring him that all the heroes are on the same side and all that matters is saving people -- a lesson Sengoku takes to heart.  Tiger & Bunny 2 Episode 2 also spotlights Kotetsu and Barnaby, with the two receiving new armor courtesy of Doc Saito, imbued with nanotechnology and an even more powerful version of Good Luck Mode -- ''Hyper Good Luck Mode''.

The following contains spoilers for Tiger & Bunny 2 Episode 2, \"No One Knows the Weight of Another's Burden,\" now streaming on Netflix.   After a jam-packed season premiere, Tiger & Bunny 2 slows down for its second episode to focus on some of its new characters -- most prominently Subara Sengoku, the barrier-powered superhero Mr. Black.  Before coming to Stern Bild, Sengoku performed superheroics under the alias of ''Hello Goodbye'' in a city called Panjourney alongside two other heroes. After doing well in Stern Bild's superhero hiring exam, he was relocated to the city and his hero name was changed to Mr. Black. However, the difference between his prior hero life and his career in the First League prove to be something of a culture shock for young Sengoku. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Novelizations May Reveal New Premiere Date for Movie                As the lowest-ranked hero in the First League, Sengoku receives pressure from his sponsor and, after missing a mission, the threat of being fired. Sengoku, who became a hero out of a genuine desire to help others, comes to resent the rampant commercialism endemic to Stern Bild's hero culture -- similarly to Kotetsu in Season 1.  While Sengoku receives the brunt of this episode's focus, his partner receives some additional development as well. It's made clear that Thomas Taurus is considered a prodigy among the new batch of heroes, to the extent that Sengoku is asked to be little more than his backup. Sengoku interrogates his fellow First Leaguers' motivations for becoming heroes in the first place, including Thomas'. While Thomas insists he only became one because he ''felt like it'', a quick flashback to an incident from his past reveals this isn't the case. No doubt a later Tiger & Bunny 2 episode will shine a light on what happened to young Thomas to actually make him a hero.  RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                As Kotetsu asks Agnes about Black, it's clear the veteran hero sees himself in the rookie. During Episode 2's climactic mission to stop a drug lord, Sengoku, afraid of being overshadowed by Thomas, tries to take the spotlight all for himself -- blowing Origami Cyclone's cover in the process. While the heroes manage to salvage the mission, they chew out Sengoku for his mistake. He admits he was afraid of being stuck in Thomas' shadow but Kotetsu appeals to his better nature, reassuring him that all the heroes are on the same side and all that matters is saving people -- a lesson Sengoku takes to heart.  Tiger & Bunny 2 Episode 2 also spotlights Kotetsu and Barnaby, with the two receiving new armor courtesy of Doc Saito, imbued with nanotechnology and an even more powerful version of Good Luck Mode -- ''Hyper Good Luck Mode''. RELATED: Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Heroes Unite in Generation Spanning Anniversary Art                Kotetsu reaffirms that his Hundred Power still only lasts one minute, while Barnaby confides to Judge Petrov that he is still haunted by the death of his parents at the hands of Maverick -- as well as the criminal organization he worked for, Ouroboros. Nonetheless, Barnaby takes comfort in the support he has from Kotetsu and the other heroes, hoping one day his heroics will help him find a sense of inner peace.  Unfortunately for Barnaby, Ouroboros are still at large and are due to come crashing back into his life. In Episode 2's post-credits stinger, it's shown that Fugan and Mugan, the two white-haired villains from Episode 1, are members of the organization. If the Tiger & Bunny 2 premiere's flash-forwards are any indication, they will come to blows with Barnaby in two months' time, meaning the hero's quest for inner peace will have to be put on hold.

But was Falcon really his original choice?                 At the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's climactic Avengers: Endgame, Steve Rogers chose to stay with Peggy and passed down the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson. And it may have taken a while, but Sam eventually took up the shield at the end of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier after stopping the Flag Smashers. But while Steve claimed that the mantle was meant for Sam, it's possible another MCU hero was in line for the role.  The Falcon and the Winter Solider made it clear that Steve wanted Sam to become the next Captain America and that Bucky supported the idea, but a Reddit theory claims that Steve and Bucky discussed Bucky taking over the role first. Of course, Steve's private conversation with Bucky prior to him going back in time was never spoken of, and while the two likely agreed that Sam was the pick, it's possible Steve also thought Bucky was a viable candidate. RELATED: Moon Knight Needs to Avoid Falcon & Winter Soldier\u2019s Biggest Problem                 According to the theory, when Steve traveled back in time to return the Infinity Stones, he had a new shield created and originally gave it to Bucky, who refused. The post goes on to explain that this event is reflected in the main timeline when Bruce Banner couldn't bring Steve back to the present, which caused Sam to panic. However, Bucky remained calm and beckoned Sam to where Steve was sitting, revealing he knew what Steve was going to tell Sam.  But while many Redditors agreed with this theory, mostly because Bucky knew of Steve's plan prior to him leaving, others disagreed with the notion that Steve would choose Bucky to be the next Captain America. Despite Bucky having the Super Soldier Serum in his veins, he acted as an assassin loyal to Hydra for a large portion of his life. And during that time, he killed many people, including Howard and Maria Stark, which would be bad press for the next Captain America. RELATED: Avengers Star Reveals Which Endgame Scene They Improvised With Robert Downey Jr.                 Some fans also wondered why Sam was the choice since he had no Super Soldier Serum in his blood. However, what many fans often forget is that the serum enhances all the user's traits, both positive and negative. For example, when John Walker took it in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, he became far more aggressive and violent, chasing after and brutally murdering a flag smasher in cold blood. The reason why Helmut Zemo despises super soldiers is due to how they are treated by the public as heroes and carry on as if they had unlimited power. In a way, by not choosing to take the serum, Sam proves he has more than it takes to become Captain America.  At the end of the day, while it may be fun to speculate that Steve initially chose Bucky to be the next Captain America, the truth is that Steve chose Sam over his best friend for a reason. Sam possessed all the qualities that would make him the ideal successor to Steve, in addition to not having a complicated and dark history as a covert assassin working for a secret Nazi organization. And contrary to popular belief, Sam's unwillingness to take the serum shows a great deal of wisdom on his end, as he recognizes the ill effects of having too much power. With all these qualities, it's no wonder why Steve chose to hand down his mantle to Sam.

But was Falcon really his original choice?                 At the end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's climactic Avengers: Endgame, Steve Rogers chose to stay with Peggy and passed down the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson. And it may have taken a while, but Sam eventually took up the shield at the end of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier after stopping the Flag Smashers. But while Steve claimed that the mantle was meant for Sam, it's possible another MCU hero was in line for the role.  The Falcon and the Winter Solider made it clear that Steve wanted Sam to become the next Captain America and that Bucky supported the idea, but a Reddit theory claims that Steve and Bucky discussed Bucky taking over the role first. Of course, Steve's private conversation with Bucky prior to him going back in time was never spoken of, and while the two likely agreed that Sam was the pick, it's possible Steve also thought Bucky was a viable candidate. RELATED: Moon Knight Needs to Avoid Falcon & Winter Soldier\u2019s Biggest Problem                 According to the theory, when Steve traveled back in time to return the Infinity Stones, he had a new shield created and originally gave it to Bucky, who refused. The post goes on to explain that this event is reflected in the main timeline when Bruce Banner couldn't bring Steve back to the present, which caused Sam to panic. However, Bucky remained calm and beckoned Sam to where Steve was sitting, revealing he knew what Steve was going to tell Sam.  But while many Redditors agreed with this theory, mostly because Bucky knew of Steve's plan prior to him leaving, others disagreed with the notion that Steve would choose Bucky to be the next Captain America. Despite Bucky having the Super Soldier Serum in his veins, he acted as an assassin loyal to Hydra for a large portion of his life. And during that time, he killed many people, including Howard and Maria Stark, which would be bad press for the next Captain America. RELATED: Avengers Star Reveals Which Endgame Scene They Improvised With Robert Downey Jr.                 Some fans also wondered why Sam was the choice since he had no Super Soldier Serum in his blood. However, what many fans often forget is that the serum enhances all the user's traits, both positive and negative. For example, when John Walker took it in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, he became far more aggressive and violent, chasing after and brutally murdering a flag smasher in cold blood. The reason why Helmut Zemo despises super soldiers is due to how they are treated by the public as heroes and carry on as if they had unlimited power. In a way, by not choosing to take the serum, Sam proves he has more than it takes to become Captain America.  At the end of the day, while it may be fun to speculate that Steve initially chose Bucky to be the next Captain America, the truth is that Steve chose Sam over his best friend for a reason. Sam possessed all the qualities that would make him the ideal successor to Steve, in addition to not having a complicated and dark history as a covert assassin working for a secret Nazi organization. And contrary to popular belief, Sam's unwillingness to take the serum shows a great deal of wisdom on his end, as he recognizes the ill effects of having too much power. With all these qualities, it's no wonder why Steve chose to hand down his mantle to Sam.

Fans of the up-and-coming shonen manga Chainsaw Man are in for a surprise with Chapter 59. Readers attempting to use the Shonen Jump app to read the latest chapter are with a disclaimer: \"Chapter 59 of Chainsaw Man is 18+ and viewable on the website only.\" Prevsious chapters had been appropriate for younger readers, so why the sudden restriction?  Chainsaw Man follows Denji, a destitute young man that fuses his heart with a type of monster called a Devil. In doing so, he gains the ability to sprout functioning chainsaws from his head and arms. However, he also loses all of his human rights and is forced to become a government Devil hunter or else be exterminated. Chainsaw Man has a track record of being graphically bloody and explicit. As a title, it has never shied away from gory or sexual content. It's almost a feature of the story, as the sheltered Denji discovers that the people around him are just as messed up as he is. RELATED: Chainsaw Man Puts a Bloody Spin on Adventure Time\u2019s Finn & Jake                 The scene that likely makes Chainsaw Man Chapter 59 \"web-only\" involves a recently introduced character named Quanxi. Currently, not much is known about her except for the fact that she's Chinese, upsettingly powerful and has a harem of Devil girls. Quanxi and a slew of other Devil hunters have traveled to Japan in a bid to kill Denji, though Quanxi seems to be procrastinating by spending time with her girls. The opening pages of Chapter 59 feature the hunter and the Devil girls, fully naked -- albeit with strategically covered lady parts -- and in the middle of a five-person orgy. And it's a two-page spread.  RELATED: First Dragon Ball English Dub Episode By Harmony Gold Is Now Online Even for Chainsaw Man, the scene is pretty intense for the normally tween-friendly Shonen Jump -- hence the move to Viz Media's website. Chainsaw Man is the latest in a range of action titles that delve into the explicit for thematic potency. Series like Kaneshiro Muneyuki's Jagaaaaan or Yuji Kaku's Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku -- another Jump series -- use harsh violence and explicit sexual situations to make points about the worlds their characters live in. And, though it's not a shonen title, another classic example of this would be Kentaro Miura's Berserk, infamous for its extremely graphic disposition.  While moving a chapter from app to site is certainly better than outright censorship, this situation is a gentle reminder that these titles don't exist in a vacuum, though many of us read them in one. They are part of a larger whole, and so still have to consider any audience that might stumble onto them.

The following contains spoilers for Season 3, Episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War, now streaming on Funimation and Crunchyroll.   The Season 3 premiere of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War picked up right where the Season 2 finale left off -- with the entire school's destruction as a result of the balloon-inflating game. Fortunately, a new school floated down from the sky and settled into place so the series could carry on unabated. It's back to business as usual in Shinomiya Kaguya's and Shirogane Miyuki's war of love, and Fujiwara, Ishigami, and Iino were in midseason form for the latest series of Student Council tomfooleries. The more things don't change, the more they stay the same in Kaguya-sama as the titular conflict continues.  As per usual, Season 3, Episode 1 is divided into three, mostly unrelated segments involving varying characters in different embarrassing scenarios. Ishigami Yu tried -- and failed -- to save Iino Miko from herself in an awkward slip-up, Kaguya's technological challenges almost caused her to lose the entire love war, and Fujiwara Chika's arm-wrestling contest (unsurprisingly) went awry. Here's a closer look at each segment and what these new developments mean for the Student Council going forward. RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Fujiwara Is the Best, Worst, Most Annoying & Most Important Character          Miko Iino Wants To Be Soothed                 The newest addition to the Student Council is Iino Miko, whom Shirogane appointed as Auditor after defeating her in the race for President. Much like the rest of the Student Council, Iino is a much odder person than would seem to the untrained eye. When she entered the Student Council room to find only Ishigami present, she quickly ended his attempts at conversation by putting in earbuds. Unfortunately she didn't plug them all the way, and Ishigami could hear the ambient noise tracks she was listening to. While they started off as strange sounds like camels yelling, eventually a borderline erotic voice started telling Iino how amazing she was, much to Ishigami's discomfort.  Ishigami has come a long way, further than anyone else in Kaguya-sama. Still coming out of his gloomy shell, he tried to figure out a way to get Iino to plug her headphones in without embarrassing her or anyone else overhearing it. Unfortunately, Fujiwara burst in as she is wont to do, followed quickly by Shirogane and Shinomiya. Ishigami tried to signal Iino by playing his own embarrassing music loudly, but instead of taking the hint, Iino just mocked him for his carelessness and immediately exposed her own bizarre listening habits to everyone else. For Iino's sake, the Student Council left as though nothing had happened and Iino was declared the day's loser.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Kaguya's Mistake Almost Costs Her the Love War                 Shinomiya's technological ineptitude almost cost her the entire war against Shirogane thanks to her ignorance on the subject of \"read receipts\" on the LINE app the Student Council uses to text each other. Staring at her phone all day and pretending not to have seen Shirogane's -- or anyone's -- messages, Shinomiya gave herself away when Shirogane realized she was reading his texts the moment he sent them. Shirogane quickly called her to force a confession from her, but Hayasaka's clutch lie about household staff screening Shinomiya's texts saved the day.  Flying under the radar in this segment was the notion that Shirogane was not only willing to text first, but to call Shinomiya as well. His confidence is improving, but Shinomiya still got the upper hand over him. However, the losers of Kaguya-sama's second segment were Iino, Ishigami, and Fujiwara because Shinomiya had been ignoring all their texts as well. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022          Chika Fujiwara Wants To Battle                 Ishigami's and Fujiwara's rivalry in Kaguya-sama is almost as entertaining as Shinomiya's and Shirogane's battle. When Ishigami declared that simply being a man made him stronger than Fujiwara, who exercises regularly while Ishigami does not, Fujiwara did the only reasonable thing and announced a Student Council arm-wrestling tournament. Ishigami quickly lost to Shinomiya, who used her Hulk strength acquired from archery to defeat the cocky Treasurer. Fujiwara, on the other hand, was quickly disqualified from her match against Shirogane when, as always, she was caught cheating at the very game she suggested. Iino, the only non-participant, instead acted as a referee since Fujiwara busted Iino's hand to prove to Ishigami that she was strong.  When Shinomiya and Shirogane met in the final round, it appeared that a clash of titans was taking place as the two valiantly struggled to overcome the other. While the rest of the Student Council was blown away, it was revealed that neither participant was giving it their all because they were enjoying holding each other's hand. Shinomiya eventually won the match when she realized her hand was about to start sweating, and was declared by the narrator to be the winner of the day's battle. Although Shinomiya got the win and started off Season 3 with a 1-0 lead over Shirogane, it's clear that the latter has upped his game this season. Shirogane and Shinomiya are closer than ever; each of them is slowly but surely becoming more confident in interacting with the other, meaning a long-awaited confession might come sooner than anyone thinks as Kaguya-sama: Love Is War continues.

The following contains spoilers for Season 3, Episode 1 of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War, now streaming on Funimation and Crunchyroll.   The Season 3 premiere of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War picked up right where the Season 2 finale left off -- with the entire school's destruction as a result of the balloon-inflating game. Fortunately, a new school floated down from the sky and settled into place so the series could carry on unabated. It's back to business as usual in Shinomiya Kaguya's and Shirogane Miyuki's war of love, and Fujiwara, Ishigami, and Iino were in midseason form for the latest series of Student Council tomfooleries. The more things don't change, the more they stay the same in Kaguya-sama as the titular conflict continues.  As per usual, Season 3, Episode 1 is divided into three, mostly unrelated segments involving varying characters in different embarrassing scenarios. Ishigami Yu tried -- and failed -- to save Iino Miko from herself in an awkward slip-up, Kaguya's technological challenges almost caused her to lose the entire love war, and Fujiwara Chika's arm-wrestling contest (unsurprisingly) went awry. Here's a closer look at each segment and what these new developments mean for the Student Council going forward. RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Fujiwara Is the Best, Worst, Most Annoying & Most Important Character          Miko Iino Wants To Be Soothed                 The newest addition to the Student Council is Iino Miko, whom Shirogane appointed as Auditor after defeating her in the race for President. Much like the rest of the Student Council, Iino is a much odder person than would seem to the untrained eye. When she entered the Student Council room to find only Ishigami present, she quickly ended his attempts at conversation by putting in earbuds. Unfortunately she didn't plug them all the way, and Ishigami could hear the ambient noise tracks she was listening to. While they started off as strange sounds like camels yelling, eventually a borderline erotic voice started telling Iino how amazing she was, much to Ishigami's discomfort.  Ishigami has come a long way, further than anyone else in Kaguya-sama. Still coming out of his gloomy shell, he tried to figure out a way to get Iino to plug her headphones in without embarrassing her or anyone else overhearing it. Unfortunately, Fujiwara burst in as she is wont to do, followed quickly by Shirogane and Shinomiya. Ishigami tried to signal Iino by playing his own embarrassing music loudly, but instead of taking the hint, Iino just mocked him for his carelessness and immediately exposed her own bizarre listening habits to everyone else. For Iino's sake, the Student Council left as though nothing had happened and Iino was declared the day's loser.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Kaguya's Mistake Almost Costs Her the Love War                 Shinomiya's technological ineptitude almost cost her the entire war against Shirogane thanks to her ignorance on the subject of \"read receipts\" on the LINE app the Student Council uses to text each other. Staring at her phone all day and pretending not to have seen Shirogane's -- or anyone's -- messages, Shinomiya gave herself away when Shirogane realized she was reading his texts the moment he sent them. Shirogane quickly called her to force a confession from her, but Hayasaka's clutch lie about household staff screening Shinomiya's texts saved the day.  Flying under the radar in this segment was the notion that Shirogane was not only willing to text first, but to call Shinomiya as well. His confidence is improving, but Shinomiya still got the upper hand over him. However, the losers of Kaguya-sama's second segment were Iino, Ishigami, and Fujiwara because Shinomiya had been ignoring all their texts as well. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022          Chika Fujiwara Wants To Battle                 Ishigami's and Fujiwara's rivalry in Kaguya-sama is almost as entertaining as Shinomiya's and Shirogane's battle. When Ishigami declared that simply being a man made him stronger than Fujiwara, who exercises regularly while Ishigami does not, Fujiwara did the only reasonable thing and announced a Student Council arm-wrestling tournament. Ishigami quickly lost to Shinomiya, who used her Hulk strength acquired from archery to defeat the cocky Treasurer. Fujiwara, on the other hand, was quickly disqualified from her match against Shirogane when, as always, she was caught cheating at the very game she suggested. Iino, the only non-participant, instead acted as a referee since Fujiwara busted Iino's hand to prove to Ishigami that she was strong.  When Shinomiya and Shirogane met in the final round, it appeared that a clash of titans was taking place as the two valiantly struggled to overcome the other. While the rest of the Student Council was blown away, it was revealed that neither participant was giving it their all because they were enjoying holding each other's hand. Shinomiya eventually won the match when she realized her hand was about to start sweating, and was declared by the narrator to be the winner of the day's battle. Although Shinomiya got the win and started off Season 3 with a 1-0 lead over Shirogane, it's clear that the latter has upped his game this season. Shirogane and Shinomiya are closer than ever; each of them is slowly but surely becoming more confident in interacting with the other, meaning a long-awaited confession might come sooner than anyone thinks as Kaguya-sama: Love Is War continues.

By CBR Staff Published 6 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Kiyo in Kyoto is a show dedicated to teaching about Japanese culture, so can it also be entertaining?                 Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is a lesser-known anime that came out at the tail end of the 2021 winter season. As it was produced by NHK World-Japan, the show walks a fine line between being just a means of entertainment and a means of education. There's only one way to find out whether it's more for entertainment or education, and that's by looking at the contents of the show.  However, before diving into the information given throughout the show, it's good to have an understanding of the context of Kiyo In Kyoto. The series follows Kiyo and her friend Sumire, who are both from Aomori Prefecture and want to become maiko (traditional Japanese entertainers found in Kyoto). While Sumire goes on to train and becomes a maiko, the titular character becomes the cook for that maiko house instead. The show then goes on to cover information about both maiko and Japanese food culture. As the show is produced by NHK World-Japan, the international version of the well-known Japanese broadcasting news and entertainment site, it would make sense that Kiyo in Kyoto is all about culture.  RELATED: Restaurant to Another World Vol. 1 Puts Iyashikei Into Isekai                 It's time to dive into the cultural aspects of the show, starting with the way it depicts the life of maiko. The series mainly takes place in the titular maiko house in the area of Kyoto called Kagai, where all the maiko and their housemothers live together. The show takes viewers along Sumire's journey in becoming a maiko, showing the training process with many tidbits of cultural information. It talks about the processes such as the classes maiko take to learn song and dance, as well as differences between maiko in training and maiko who have already made their \"debut\". One of these differences is the type of sash or obi the girls wear.  As seen in Episode 4, it shows how a senior apprentice who has not yet debuted wears a \"half dangling sash,\" while a full maiko wears a longer \"dangling sash.\" In that same episode, Sumire gets to debut as full-fledged maiko and gets her maiko name -- Momohana -- which they explain can be chosen in many ways. They can choose the Japanese characters for the maiko's name is by taking inspiration from their real names, from the maiko house they live in or even having it divined for them at a shrine. Along with all the information within the show, there is also a separate short video produced by NHK World-Japan called \"Maiko [Maiko-san Chi no Makanai-san - Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House] - 3-minute Maiko,\" available on YouTube, where real-life maiko are showcased.  RELATED: How Assassination Classroom Offers a Glimpse at Japan's Educational System Another topic that's discussed a lot in Kiyo in Kyoto is food, which means there's also a lot of information and facts about food not only from Kyoto or Aomori but from all around Japan. The episodes are formatted around the food featured in their respective segment, as each episode is generally formatted into three parts, each a chapter of the manga featuring one main food. Then, after each segment, there are little \"talking heads\" segments, where Kiyo and Sumire, as well as sometimes their senior Tsurukoma, talk about the food they ate in that segment as well as their regional counterparts.  This segment is called \"Sumire and Kiyo's Dish of the Day.\" A good example of the regional differences discussed during these scenes can be seen in the last segment of Episode 5, where the series talks about different soups from across Japan. It starts with the soup that was featured in the episode -- hittsumi soup from Aomori -- and goes on to talk about soups from other places, such as teppo soup from Hokkaido, natto soup from Yamagata and itoko soup from Kyoto. This kind of cultural analysis in these segments is common and very educational.                  Of course, to be an anime, the show must be entertaining as well, and entertaining it is. Kiyo in Kyoto has no lack of cute characters and scenes. Not everything in the show is meant to teach the viewer; it also contains a plot and characters that grow throughout, as well as numerous cute and fluffy scenes. The show can have both entertainment and educational elements within it, as many shows do. So, to answer whether Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is an entertainment or an education series, it's happily both.                   Heaven's Design Team Mixes 'Edutainment' With...

The episodes are formatted around the food featured in their respective segment, as each episode is generally formatted into three parts, each a chapter of the manga featuring one main food. Then, after each segment, there are little \"talking heads\" segments, where Kiyo and Sumire, as well as sometimes their senior Tsurukoma, talk about the food they ate in that segment as well as their regional counterparts.  This segment is called \"Sumire and Kiyo's Dish of the Day.\" A good example of the regional differences discussed during these scenes can be seen in the last segment of Episode 5, where the series talks about different soups from across Japan. It starts with the soup that was featured in the episode -- hittsumi soup from Aomori -- and goes on to talk about soups from other places, such as teppo soup from Hokkaido, natto soup from Yamagata and itoko soup from Kyoto. This kind of cultural analysis in these segments is common and very educational.                  Of course, to be an anime, the show must be entertaining as well, and entertaining it is. Kiyo in Kyoto has no lack of cute characters and scenes. Not everything in the show is meant to teach the viewer; it also contains a plot and characters that grow throughout, as well as numerous cute and fluffy scenes. The show can have both entertainment and educational elements within it, as many shows do. So, to answer whether Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is an entertainment or an education series, it's happily both.                   Heaven's Design Team Mixes 'Edutainment' With...

Musical icon Lady Gaga received an anime makeover thanks to a new partnership with Crunchyroll.  According to an official press release, pre-orders for the special Crunchyroll Loves x Lady Gaga streetwear collection will be available through April 21, exclusively through the streaming service's online store. Featuring imagery inspired by the singer's sixth studio album, Chromatica, and artwork from McFlyy, the collection has a total of eight pieces, including multiple t-shirts and hoodies, a pair of back fleece joggers, a bucket hat and a beanie. The Born This Way Foundation, Lady Gaga's non-profit that focuses on improving mental health and making the world a happier place, will receive a portion of the total proceeds.

It went on to win multiple awards, including Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Rain on Me\" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and Western Album of the Year at the Japan Gold Disc Awards in 2021. The Crunchyroll Loves x Lady Gaga collection isn't the only new thing that can be found on the streaming service's website; several new anime series are currently making their premieres as part of the spring 2022 lineup. This includes Spy x Family, Love After World Domination, Skeleton Knight in Another World and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn by a Typical Nobody.  RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Teams Up With Uniqlo for New Graphic Tee Collection Multiple fan-favorite shows are making their return on Crunchyroll as well. Most notably, the second season of the iconic isekai anime, The Rising of the Shield Hero, is finally airing after the first season ended back in 2019. Crunchyroll is also streaming new seasons of Ascendance of a Bookworm and Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story. The anime streaming giant recently removed over fifty titles from its catalog. The removal included both popular series, like Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Food Wars: Shogeki No Shoma, Akame ga Kill! and No Game No Life, as well as more obscure shows, like Sunday Without God, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Is The Order a Rabbit?, Infinite Stratos and Familiar of Zero F. While no official explanation for the animes' removal was provided by Crunchyroll, it is noteworthy that the majority of the titles are licensed by Sentai Filmworks, which owns the competing anime streaming service, HIDIVE.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

The following contains spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1046, \"Raizo,\" by Eiichiro Oda, Stephen Paul and Vanessa Satone, available in English from Viz Media.   Previously, in One PIece Chapter 1045, Kaido and Luffy continued their fight since Luffy had awakened his Devil Fruit. He displayed some of his new abilities and powers, showing that he could transfer the rubber properties of his body to Kaido's at will. He also revealed that he too could become gigantic before proceeding to use Kaido as a jump rope. Everyone who saw him was shocked at Luffy's survival and new form, his hair and clothes now pure white. Despite this, Kaido stood firm in his belief that nobody could beat him, but Luffy also was not deterred. As the two clashed, Luffy was able to knock Kaido onto his back, asking him, \"Isn't this fun, Kaido?!!\"  Chapter 1046 picks right back up with Luffy wondering what he should call that last attack. Kaido sits up, holding his head and asks Luffy who he is. Luffy looks at him curiously before Zunesha begins reminiscing about the beating of the Drums of Liberation and Joyboy, saying it's almost as if he is there. As Zunesha that it should put its hopes in Luffy, the Straw Hat captain replies to Kaido's question, proudly declaring he's Monkey D. Luffy, the future King of the Pirates. RELATED: How One Piece's Earlier Arcs Prove Luffy Is the Best User of His Devil Fruit                Kaido smiles widely, explaining to Luffy that he's experiencing a Devil Fruit Awakening and that he's finally harnessing the full potential of his ridiculous abilities. He says that he's lost everything he's built in this war, but guesses that Luffy has also lost a lot. Luffy declares that he isn't backing down yet and that there's still something he needs to take back. Kaido responds to this with a Kundali Dragon Swarm, rapidly bashing Luffy with his kanabo. Luffy's body just conforms to the shape of the weapon before he counters with a flurry of punches.  As the two men try to catch their breath, the smoke and fumes from the fires below finally reach the roof of the Skull Dome. Luffy begins coughing from the smoke, with Kaido pointing out that the fire must have taken over the whole castle and that everyone below will die. Luffy just smiles, explaining that he left everyone else in charge while all he has to do is beat Kaido. He rushes towards Kaido full force. He tries to stop Luffy from coming any closer with a Demolition Gust attack, but Luffy just stretches his legs so that his body dodges the attack. RELATED: One Piece: What We Know About Nika So Far                 Down on the Performance Floor, all of the fighters are left trying to figure out how to escape the inferno. Chopper and Nami find each other, with Chopper saying he can't find any of their friends and that he thinks they're all trapped in the fire. This causes Nami to worry as the entire island is engulfed in flames and that there's no way to escape unless the island lands. Chopper asks Zeus about using his rain, but the cloud is also terrified of the fire. In the Basement, Briscola and a group of fighters are completely surrounded by fire, with no escpe in sight. On the First Floor, Bepo and his group are also having trouble escaping the blaze, begging their captain to save them. In another part of the Basement, a group of samurai are panicking at the sight of Brook, thinking that he lost his skin in the fire. He tries to assure them he was always this way before turning to Robin and saying that they need to get everyone out. Robin, however, doesn't think there is a way out. Sanji and the women are trying to get out of the Pleasure Hall, but they too are struggling.  RELATED: Did One Piece Just Reveal the Secret of Marijoa's Treasure?                Elsewhere, Apoo and Inbi are also trying to get out of the Basement, and Inbi burns his hand trying to punch out one of the walls. Apoo berates him for stopping and screams at him to keep going, which only further angers the Numbers member. Usopp and Hamlet too are trapped below, with Usopp trying to quench the flames with his Sprinkler plants. Hamlet tells him that he's only wasting energy, but Usopp is determined to get himself, Kiku, and Kin'emon out because he promised Izo that he would, forgetting to mention Hamlet in the process. In the Right Brain Tower, Franky is carrying Zoro on his shoulder, trying to find the way to Chopper to get medical help for him. He's followed by a group of stragglers, begging him to save them.  On the Fourth Floor, Jimbei and Raizo are putting their plan into action. Raizo thanks Jimbei for having faith in him, with Jimbei saying that because Luffy trusts the samurai, he does too. Raizo, motivated by his failure to help the Kozuki family escape their own burning castle 20 years ago, prepares to enact his plan. In a flashback, he experiences Zunesha washing itself, amazed at how much water it used. He finally unveils his Ninpo: Scroll-Scroll Jutsu, The Elephant's Bath, creating a large tube of water. Jimbei is amazed at how large it is before grabbing the water and redirecting it to put out the flames in the castle.  RELATED: One Piece, Digimon Anime End Month-Long Hiatus Due to Hacking Incident                The water travels down to the Third Floor where Blackback's group are surrounded by the fire, but then get caught in the rushing water. The water crashes through the walls and streams through the hallways, putting out the fire. Jimbei encourages Raizo to keep going until the entire castle is flooded, the ninja continuing to concentrate on saving everyone. The water finally reaches the First Floor just as Killer's group become trapped on the stairway. Outside, Yamato rushes Momonosuke, but Momo is confused since Kaido is still alive. Yamato explains that while that's true, he's at his limit and that his Flame Clouds will soon disappear. Momo needs to make his own that are strong enough to hold the island up; Onigashima is about to fall. The chapter closes out on an image of Luffy in the air above Kaido, lightning flashing behind him, Luffy gripping one of the bolts.  The next chapter of One Piece will be available on Sunday, April 25th.

The following contains spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1046, \"Raizo,\" by Eiichiro Oda, Stephen Paul and Vanessa Satone, available in English from Viz Media.   Previously, in One PIece Chapter 1045, Kaido and Luffy continued their fight since Luffy had awakened his Devil Fruit. He displayed some of his new abilities and powers, showing that he could transfer the rubber properties of his body to Kaido's at will. He also revealed that he too could become gigantic before proceeding to use Kaido as a jump rope. Everyone who saw him was shocked at Luffy's survival and new form, his hair and clothes now pure white. Despite this, Kaido stood firm in his belief that nobody could beat him, but Luffy also was not deterred. As the two clashed, Luffy was able to knock Kaido onto his back, asking him, \"Isn't this fun, Kaido?!!\"  Chapter 1046 picks right back up with Luffy wondering what he should call that last attack. Kaido sits up, holding his head and asks Luffy who he is. Luffy looks at him curiously before Zunesha begins reminiscing about the beating of the Drums of Liberation and Joyboy, saying it's almost as if he is there. As Zunesha that it should put its hopes in Luffy, the Straw Hat captain replies to Kaido's question, proudly declaring he's Monkey D. Luffy, the future King of the Pirates. RELATED: How One Piece's Earlier Arcs Prove Luffy Is the Best User of His Devil Fruit                Kaido smiles widely, explaining to Luffy that he's experiencing a Devil Fruit Awakening and that he's finally harnessing the full potential of his ridiculous abilities. He says that he's lost everything he's built in this war, but guesses that Luffy has also lost a lot. Luffy declares that he isn't backing down yet and that there's still something he needs to take back. Kaido responds to this with a Kundali Dragon Swarm, rapidly bashing Luffy with his kanabo. Luffy's body just conforms to the shape of the weapon before he counters with a flurry of punches.  As the two men try to catch their breath, the smoke and fumes from the fires below finally reach the roof of the Skull Dome. Luffy begins coughing from the smoke, with Kaido pointing out that the fire must have taken over the whole castle and that everyone below will die. Luffy just smiles, explaining that he left everyone else in charge while all he has to do is beat Kaido. He rushes towards Kaido full force. He tries to stop Luffy from coming any closer with a Demolition Gust attack, but Luffy just stretches his legs so that his body dodges the attack. RELATED: One Piece: What We Know About Nika So Far                 Down on the Performance Floor, all of the fighters are left trying to figure out how to escape the inferno. Chopper and Nami find each other, with Chopper saying he can't find any of their friends and that he thinks they're all trapped in the fire. This causes Nami to worry as the entire island is engulfed in flames and that there's no way to escape unless the island lands. Chopper asks Zeus about using his rain, but the cloud is also terrified of the fire. In the Basement, Briscola and a group of fighters are completely surrounded by fire, with no escpe in sight. On the First Floor, Bepo and his group are also having trouble escaping the blaze, begging their captain to save them. In another part of the Basement, a group of samurai are panicking at the sight of Brook, thinking that he lost his skin in the fire. He tries to assure them he was always this way before turning to Robin and saying that they need to get everyone out. Robin, however, doesn't think there is a way out. Sanji and the women are trying to get out of the Pleasure Hall, but they too are struggling.  RELATED: Did One Piece Just Reveal the Secret of Marijoa's Treasure?                Elsewhere, Apoo and Inbi are also trying to get out of the Basement, and Inbi burns his hand trying to punch out one of the walls. Apoo berates him for stopping and screams at him to keep going, which only further angers the Numbers member. Usopp and Hamlet too are trapped below, with Usopp trying to quench the flames with his Sprinkler plants. Hamlet tells him that he's only wasting energy, but Usopp is determined to get himself, Kiku, and Kin'emon out because he promised Izo that he would, forgetting to mention Hamlet in the process. In the Right Brain Tower, Franky is carrying Zoro on his shoulder, trying to find the way to Chopper to get medical help for him. He's followed by a group of stragglers, begging him to save them.  On the Fourth Floor, Jimbei and Raizo are putting their plan into action. Raizo thanks Jimbei for having faith in him, with Jimbei saying that because Luffy trusts the samurai, he does too. Raizo, motivated by his failure to help the Kozuki family escape their own burning castle 20 years ago, prepares to enact his plan. In a flashback, he experiences Zunesha washing itself, amazed at how much water it used. He finally unveils his Ninpo: Scroll-Scroll Jutsu, The Elephant's Bath, creating a large tube of water. Jimbei is amazed at how large it is before grabbing the water and redirecting it to put out the flames in the castle.  RELATED: One Piece, Digimon Anime End Month-Long Hiatus Due to Hacking Incident                The water travels down to the Third Floor where Blackback's group are surrounded by the fire, but then get caught in the rushing water. The water crashes through the walls and streams through the hallways, putting out the fire. Jimbei encourages Raizo to keep going until the entire castle is flooded, the ninja continuing to concentrate on saving everyone. The water finally reaches the First Floor just as Killer's group become trapped on the stairway. Outside, Yamato rushes Momonosuke, but Momo is confused since Kaido is still alive. Yamato explains that while that's true, he's at his limit and that his Flame Clouds will soon disappear. Momo needs to make his own that are strong enough to hold the island up; Onigashima is about to fall. The chapter closes out on an image of Luffy in the air above Kaido, lightning flashing behind him, Luffy gripping one of the bolts.  The next chapter of One Piece will be available on Sunday, April 25th.

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions. With no hope of relief in sight, how long can Crosby, Whitamore and Singh preserve their force against annihilation?

Neo-Gotham is alive and actively working to take out Terry McGinnis, who loses another ally in Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1.                 Warning: The following article contains spoilers for Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1, available now from DC Comics.An important ally to Bruce Wayne and Terry McGinnis retires just as Batman Beyond is dealing with a massive threat.  In the Batman Beyond timeline, former Batgirl Barbara Gordon took up her father's role in the Gotham City Police Department as Commissioner Gordon. This new role for her character was introduced back during the original Batman Beyond television series' first season. Now, in Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1, Gordon is moving on from the GCPD and leaving her crime-fighting life behind. RELATED: Major Issues: Batman Beyond Returns and X-Men Face Marvel's Destiny of X Gordon reveals to McGinnis that she has spent \"too many years\" and lost \"too many friends\" while taking on Gotham and Neo-Gotham's criminals. She believes that the city does not need her anymore, when she could not be farther from the truth. A super-intelligence now controls Neo-Gotham and behaves as the city itself, so McGinnis is running out of allies to help put an end to it.  One of Neo-Gotham's first actions was killing Bruce Wayne in Batman: Urban Legends #7 -- the prelude to Neo-Year -- after worming its way into the Batcomputer and Wayne's pacemaker. To try and slow the super-intelligence down, McGinnis destroyed the Batcave and Wayne Manor, but the intelligence remained in control over the whole city. McGinnis already lost one mentor and ally, but now he loses another with Barbara out of the GCPD. RELATED: The High-Tech Batman Beyond is Continuing a Low-Tech Tradition While he may be running short on allies, McGinnis has plenty of criminals to face in addition to Neo-Gotham itself, considering that the city is creating new villains to take him down. One introduced in the latest issue is Donovan Lumos aka the Holographic Man, a former crime lord. Not only Lumos still engaging in criminal activities, but he is doing it all as Wayne-Powers' latest Chief Executive Officer.  Towards the end of the issue, Terry faces another new villain while trying to interrupt Lumos' drug shipment at Neo-Gotham's docks. This mystery combatant works for Neo-Gotham and informs McGinnis that the city does not truly want him dead, but compliant to its will. While claiming to be the city's \"sword,\" the villain sets off a massive explosion that seemingly leaves McGinnis burried under rubble. Whether Gordon will return to help McGinnis in the series remains to be seen. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 is written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing, featuring interior and cover artwork by Max Dunbar, colors by Sebastian Cheng and letters by Aditya Bidikar. Variant covers are contributed to by Christian Ward, Simone Di Meo, Jim Cheung and Jay David Ramos. The issue is available now in print and digitally from DC Comics.

RELATED: The High-Tech Batman Beyond is Continuing a Low-Tech Tradition While he may be running short on allies, McGinnis has plenty of criminals to face in addition to Neo-Gotham itself, considering that the city is creating new villains to take him down. One introduced in the latest issue is Donovan Lumos aka the Holographic Man, a former crime lord. Not only Lumos still engaging in criminal activities, but he is doing it all as Wayne-Powers' latest Chief Executive Officer.  Towards the end of the issue, Terry faces another new villain while trying to interrupt Lumos' drug shipment at Neo-Gotham's docks. This mystery combatant works for Neo-Gotham and informs McGinnis that the city does not truly want him dead, but compliant to its will. While claiming to be the city's \"sword,\" the villain sets off a massive explosion that seemingly leaves McGinnis burried under rubble. Whether Gordon will return to help McGinnis in the series remains to be seen. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 is written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing, featuring interior and cover artwork by Max Dunbar, colors by Sebastian Cheng and letters by Aditya Bidikar. Variant covers are contributed to by Christian Ward, Simone Di Meo, Jim Cheung and Jay David Ramos. The issue is available now in print and digitally from DC Comics.

Spy x Family is probably the most hyped-up new show of anime's spring season. It might even be the most anticipated anime debut of 2022. Not only is it an adaptation of one of the most critically acclaimed manga of the last decade, but the anime is also being produced by Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song) and CloverWorks (My Dress-Up Darling, Wonder Egg Priority) -- two of the highest-profile animation studios in Japan. It's an understatement to say that the Spy x Family anime is premiering to extremely high expectations. Thankfully, the first episode of the anime lives up to those lofty expectations and may be one of the rare adaptations that manage to improve its source material.  The first episode of the show introduces viewers to the world-renowned super spy who is only known by his code name, Twilight. After deftly defusing an attempt to smear a powerful politician in the show's intro, Twilight is assigned his most challenging mission ever. This mission requires him to pretend to be an average family man to get close to his next target, a dangerous political leader who only appears in public to attend events held by the prestigious private academy his son attends. In order to infiltrate the school, Twilight takes on the alias \"Loid Forger\" and adopts a seemingly normal little girl, Anya. Unfortunately for him, his daughter has a secret of her own: she is an escaped experiment with psychic powers, which she immediately uses to discover her new father's double identity.  RELATED: Spy X Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime The new show manages to perfectly translate the humor from Tatsuya Endo's original manga. From the absurdity of the toupee-based conspiracy in the intro to Anya's reactions whenever she reads her father's purely espionage-focused thoughts, the first episode is loaded with multiple laugh-out-loud moments. There are even a few gags that are improved in the anime, such as the scene where Anya attempts to stealthily follow her super-spy father out of the house. The comedy is also improved thanks to excellent voice acting from Haikyuu's Takuya Eguchi, who perfectly captures Loid's world-weary yet empathetic personality with his performance. Atsumi Tanezaki, who previously starred in Mob Psycho 100, is also perfectly cast as Anya, whom she manages to portray as being adorably naive without being cloying.  Another aspect of the show that is improved with animation is the series' brief action scenes, which are animated with all the smoothness and impact you'd expect from both Wit Studio and CloverWorks. While the animation doesn't quite match the best moments from Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song's chaotic battles or the loving attention to detail that was displayed in My Dress-Up Darling, it's still a great-looking show in its own right. Action isn't the focus of the series, but the first episode makes it clear that the team behind the show is more than capable of choreographing and animating an exciting, impactful brawl for the scenes that require Loid to get his hands dirty.  RELATED: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary With that said, the anime wouldn't live up to the award-winning manga if Spy x Family didn't also manage to translate the original work's tangible feelings of warmth and familial tenderness. Thankfully, those key elements of the series appear to have been ported over fully intact. Even within its first episode, it's hard to not feel something when Loid and Anya celebrate their first victories together and show the first hints of a true father-daughter bond. These moments were the most memorable parts of Endo's manga, and they're also the best parts of the anime's premiere episode. In less than half an hour, the show manages to give you an idea of who Loid and Anya really are, and makes you want to see the dysfunctional family succeed.  Judged only on its spot-on comedy and action, Spy x Family would already be in the running for the best series of the last decade, but the series' more heartfelt moments elevate it to potentially being one of the best anime and manga series of all time. If the rest of the season can keep up the level of quality displayed in the first episode, then anime fans are truly in for something special. Spy x Family is being simulcast on Crunchyroll. The original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Spy x Family is probably the most hyped-up new show of anime's spring season. It might even be the most anticipated anime debut of 2022. Not only is it an adaptation of one of the most critically acclaimed manga of the last decade, but the anime is also being produced by Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song) and CloverWorks (My Dress-Up Darling, Wonder Egg Priority) -- two of the highest-profile animation studios in Japan. It's an understatement to say that the Spy x Family anime is premiering to extremely high expectations. Thankfully, the first episode of the anime lives up to those lofty expectations and may be one of the rare adaptations that manage to improve its source material.  The first episode of the show introduces viewers to the world-renowned super spy who is only known by his code name, Twilight. After deftly defusing an attempt to smear a powerful politician in the show's intro, Twilight is assigned his most challenging mission ever. This mission requires him to pretend to be an average family man to get close to his next target, a dangerous political leader who only appears in public to attend events held by the prestigious private academy his son attends. In order to infiltrate the school, Twilight takes on the alias \"Loid Forger\" and adopts a seemingly normal little girl, Anya. Unfortunately for him, his daughter has a secret of her own: she is an escaped experiment with psychic powers, which she immediately uses to discover her new father's double identity.  RELATED: Spy X Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime The new show manages to perfectly translate the humor from Tatsuya Endo's original manga. From the absurdity of the toupee-based conspiracy in the intro to Anya's reactions whenever she reads her father's purely espionage-focused thoughts, the first episode is loaded with multiple laugh-out-loud moments. There are even a few gags that are improved in the anime, such as the scene where Anya attempts to stealthily follow her super-spy father out of the house. The comedy is also improved thanks to excellent voice acting from Haikyuu's Takuya Eguchi, who perfectly captures Loid's world-weary yet empathetic personality with his performance. Atsumi Tanezaki, who previously starred in Mob Psycho 100, is also perfectly cast as Anya, whom she manages to portray as being adorably naive without being cloying.  Another aspect of the show that is improved with animation is the series' brief action scenes, which are animated with all the smoothness and impact you'd expect from both Wit Studio and CloverWorks. While the animation doesn't quite match the best moments from Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song's chaotic battles or the loving attention to detail that was displayed in My Dress-Up Darling, it's still a great-looking show in its own right. Action isn't the focus of the series, but the first episode makes it clear that the team behind the show is more than capable of choreographing and animating an exciting, impactful brawl for the scenes that require Loid to get his hands dirty.  RELATED: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary With that said, the anime wouldn't live up to the award-winning manga if Spy x Family didn't also manage to translate the original work's tangible feelings of warmth and familial tenderness. Thankfully, those key elements of the series appear to have been ported over fully intact. Even within its first episode, it's hard to not feel something when Loid and Anya celebrate their first victories together and show the first hints of a true father-daughter bond. These moments were the most memorable parts of Endo's manga, and they're also the best parts of the anime's premiere episode. In less than half an hour, the show manages to give you an idea of who Loid and Anya really are, and makes you want to see the dysfunctional family succeed.  Judged only on its spot-on comedy and action, Spy x Family would already be in the running for the best series of the last decade, but the series' more heartfelt moments elevate it to potentially being one of the best anime and manga series of all time. If the rest of the season can keep up the level of quality displayed in the first episode, then anime fans are truly in for something special. Spy x Family is being simulcast on Crunchyroll. The original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

In One-Punch Man Chapter 159, he surprisingly expresses immense anger.                  The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   Saitama is known for not being fazed by any threat or danger. He maintains a poker face, even in front of possible Earth-destroying catastrophe -- like when he fought Boros the alien invader or Monster King Orochi. However, that doesn't mean he is an unfeeling robot. There are some cases in which he is actually angered, but only in Chapter 159 has he reached the peak of hatred.  With the amount of power Saitama possesses, there's no longer anything that poses a threat to him. He simply decimates anything that stands in his way with a single punch, hence, the title of the manga. He is, however, not without weaknesses. He is often flustered for missing out on sales and is always problematizing his budget, and the Monster Association's wide-scale attack finally brought out the worst in him. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died                 The first question Saitama asked the monsterized Garo was confirmation of his identity, which the Hero Hunter provided. He then launched into a long rant about being the absolute evil, but Saitama was no longer interested in what the monster had to say. Because he deemed Garo not to be a monster, despite the Hero Hunter's admittance, he was convinced there was nothing left for him to do there, leaving Garo surprised and confused..  Before leaving, though, Saitama ranted for a bit, recalling going out of his place to report the recurring noise. However, his house got destroyed, and he now had to go look for his belongings. Saitama expressed his frustration at the situation, claiming he was so angry he could destroy the world. Saitama's outburst wasn't just a bluff, because Garo felt immense pressure when the bald hero made the declaration. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task                 Saitama getting angry is a rare occurrence, and this is the first time he reached a world-destroying level of anger. Unsurprisingly, the cause of his fury is not something heavy like losing a friend or witnessing great evil. Rather, it has something to do with his belongings. Saitama has always been concerned about things ordinary individuals will consider trivial -- like supermarket sales and winning against King in a video game. It is, however, interesting to see him express an emotion to that extreme.  Saitama has always been shown to be a calm-headed individual who couldn't feel any sense of danger, so seeing him in a fit of immense rage is a rare occurrence. If there's any moral lesson this teaches the audience, then it's that nobody should mess with Saitama's belongings under any circumstances.

In One-Punch Man Chapter 159, he surprisingly expresses immense anger.                  The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   Saitama is known for not being fazed by any threat or danger. He maintains a poker face, even in front of possible Earth-destroying catastrophe -- like when he fought Boros the alien invader or Monster King Orochi. However, that doesn't mean he is an unfeeling robot. There are some cases in which he is actually angered, but only in Chapter 159 has he reached the peak of hatred.  With the amount of power Saitama possesses, there's no longer anything that poses a threat to him. He simply decimates anything that stands in his way with a single punch, hence, the title of the manga. He is, however, not without weaknesses. He is often flustered for missing out on sales and is always problematizing his budget, and the Monster Association's wide-scale attack finally brought out the worst in him. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died                 The first question Saitama asked the monsterized Garo was confirmation of his identity, which the Hero Hunter provided. He then launched into a long rant about being the absolute evil, but Saitama was no longer interested in what the monster had to say. Because he deemed Garo not to be a monster, despite the Hero Hunter's admittance, he was convinced there was nothing left for him to do there, leaving Garo surprised and confused..  Before leaving, though, Saitama ranted for a bit, recalling going out of his place to report the recurring noise. However, his house got destroyed, and he now had to go look for his belongings. Saitama expressed his frustration at the situation, claiming he was so angry he could destroy the world. Saitama's outburst wasn't just a bluff, because Garo felt immense pressure when the bald hero made the declaration. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task                 Saitama getting angry is a rare occurrence, and this is the first time he reached a world-destroying level of anger. Unsurprisingly, the cause of his fury is not something heavy like losing a friend or witnessing great evil. Rather, it has something to do with his belongings. Saitama has always been concerned about things ordinary individuals will consider trivial -- like supermarket sales and winning against King in a video game. It is, however, interesting to see him express an emotion to that extreme.  Saitama has always been shown to be a calm-headed individual who couldn't feel any sense of danger, so seeing him in a fit of immense rage is a rare occurrence. If there's any moral lesson this teaches the audience, then it's that nobody should mess with Saitama's belongings under any circumstances.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Chapter 62.1 by Tatsuya Endo, Casey Loe and Rina Mapa, available in English now via Viz Media.   In Spy x Family, not much is known about Twilight's past despite the readers having been with him on his family shenanigans and his missions. The only few details that have been revealed are that he abandoned his old life in favor of the life of a spy. Having lost his parents in the war, Twilight's motivation to maintain peace between Westalis and Ostania is so there will not be any other orphans like him. He wanted to create a world where children wouldn't have to cry.  Even though Twilight has no experience being a parent, he is undoubtedly a good father. While he is adamant that the Forger family is nothing but a facade, he nonetheless would be willing to put himself in danger to protect Anya, Yor and Bond. This week's chapter of Spy x Family dives into Twilight's past -- before he was Twilight -- and the events that made him the man he is. RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                 If there was any hope that readers would get to know Twilight's real name since this chapter focused on his childhood, those hopes were quickly dashed; the chapter cheekily blacked out his name. As a boy, Twilight spent most of his days playing war with his friends in an abandoned depot. He and his friends quickly become infatuated with the idea of being soldiers. At home, however, Twilight immediately hides his toy gun from his father.  Twilight's father is an interesting and rather contradictory character. Upon seeing how eager his son is to go to war to find \"those awful monsters from the East,\" he immediately slaps him. It's not clear if this is a common recurrence, but the fact that his father's first instinct was to hit his son is already concerning. What's more, Twilight's childhood seems to be marred with instances of fights between his mother and father. While the slap is unjustified and should never have been done, his father's anger is understandable. All the sentiments around the Ostanians being \"monsters\" are propaganda fed by those in Westalis. Instead of hoping for war, Twilight's father says to his son that he should hope for peace.  That's exactly what adult Twilight's mission is -- to maintain peace between Ostania and Westalis so that war doesn't break out. His father's words left a strong enough impact for him to carry that through to his adult life. And although Twilight's father insisted that violence would never achieve peace, Twilight's line of work does demand a certain level of violence in order to protect the powerless. It's not specified, but Twilight's father's job appears to be diplomatic in nature, and he may have worked in a department that maintained peace at the border.  RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Anya Is the Best Girl of the Series                 Knowing who Twilight is now and his occupation, it's endearing to see what he was like when he was a child. Adult Twilight can lie with ease and disguise himself flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Twilight as a boy feels absolutely guilty when he has to lie to his father for pocket money to buy the soldier set. Even after getting the gun, he can't go through with playing with it and returns home. After talking to the croquette lady and realizing that the Ostanians may not be as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Twilight wants to return home and apologize to his father.  Sadly, Twilight doesn't get a chance to do that. A bomb crashes into the town of Luwen, destroying the depot that Twilight's friends were playing in just a few hours ago, leaving nothing but the \"KEEP OUT\" sign lying in the rubble. The chapter doesn't confirm whether or not Twilight's friends managed to escape before they were killed, but it doesn't look optimistic. Despite having never been a father before, it's made abundantly clear that Twilight's parenting style was influenced by his own father. He would never raise a hand to Anya, and his parenting is usually much more gentle and gives off heartwarming vibes. This is a Twilight who never wants to inflict the same pain on his child (even if Anya is his fake daughter) that he endured when he was young.  It's hard to remember that Spy x Family is set during a time when war could erupt at any moment. All of the comedic moments are what make Spy x Family so enjoyable, but moments like these with Twilight's backstory make readers realize that this is what makes the manga so special.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Chapter 62.1 by Tatsuya Endo, Casey Loe and Rina Mapa, available in English now via Viz Media.   In Spy x Family, not much is known about Twilight's past despite the readers having been with him on his family shenanigans and his missions. The only few details that have been revealed are that he abandoned his old life in favor of the life of a spy. Having lost his parents in the war, Twilight's motivation to maintain peace between Westalis and Ostania is so there will not be any other orphans like him. He wanted to create a world where children wouldn't have to cry.  Even though Twilight has no experience being a parent, he is undoubtedly a good father. While he is adamant that the Forger family is nothing but a facade, he nonetheless would be willing to put himself in danger to protect Anya, Yor and Bond. This week's chapter of Spy x Family dives into Twilight's past -- before he was Twilight -- and the events that made him the man he is. RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                 If there was any hope that readers would get to know Twilight's real name since this chapter focused on his childhood, those hopes were quickly dashed; the chapter cheekily blacked out his name. As a boy, Twilight spent most of his days playing war with his friends in an abandoned depot. He and his friends quickly become infatuated with the idea of being soldiers. At home, however, Twilight immediately hides his toy gun from his father.  Twilight's father is an interesting and rather contradictory character. Upon seeing how eager his son is to go to war to find \"those awful monsters from the East,\" he immediately slaps him. It's not clear if this is a common recurrence, but the fact that his father's first instinct was to hit his son is already concerning. What's more, Twilight's childhood seems to be marred with instances of fights between his mother and father. While the slap is unjustified and should never have been done, his father's anger is understandable. All the sentiments around the Ostanians being \"monsters\" are propaganda fed by those in Westalis. Instead of hoping for war, Twilight's father says to his son that he should hope for peace.  That's exactly what adult Twilight's mission is -- to maintain peace between Ostania and Westalis so that war doesn't break out. His father's words left a strong enough impact for him to carry that through to his adult life. And although Twilight's father insisted that violence would never achieve peace, Twilight's line of work does demand a certain level of violence in order to protect the powerless. It's not specified, but Twilight's father's job appears to be diplomatic in nature, and he may have worked in a department that maintained peace at the border.  RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Anya Is the Best Girl of the Series                 Knowing who Twilight is now and his occupation, it's endearing to see what he was like when he was a child. Adult Twilight can lie with ease and disguise himself flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Twilight as a boy feels absolutely guilty when he has to lie to his father for pocket money to buy the soldier set. Even after getting the gun, he can't go through with playing with it and returns home. After talking to the croquette lady and realizing that the Ostanians may not be as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Twilight wants to return home and apologize to his father.  Sadly, Twilight doesn't get a chance to do that. A bomb crashes into the town of Luwen, destroying the depot that Twilight's friends were playing in just a few hours ago, leaving nothing but the \"KEEP OUT\" sign lying in the rubble. The chapter doesn't confirm whether or not Twilight's friends managed to escape before they were killed, but it doesn't look optimistic. Despite having never been a father before, it's made abundantly clear that Twilight's parenting style was influenced by his own father. He would never raise a hand to Anya, and his parenting is usually much more gentle and gives off heartwarming vibes. This is a Twilight who never wants to inflict the same pain on his child (even if Anya is his fake daughter) that he endured when he was young.  It's hard to remember that Spy x Family is set during a time when war could erupt at any moment. All of the comedic moments are what make Spy x Family so enjoyable, but moments like these with Twilight's backstory make readers realize that this is what makes the manga so special.

By Jessie Xu Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Enmu has been a mysterious character in Demon Slayer from the start, but one topic has been hotly debated: the demon's gender.                 The most powerful demons in Demon Slayer are called the Twelve Kizuki (Demon Moons), who are further divided into six Upper Ranks and six Lower Ranks. The Lower Ranks were later all slaughtered by Muzan in disdain of their weakness, with the exception of one: Enmu.  Enmu is the Lower Rank One demon, and the primary antagonist in the Mugen Train Arc, who appears as a young man of average height with shoulder-length black hair tinged with pink, and blue eyes that have the kanji for \"Lower One\" etched into the irises. These neutral features, as well as a slow, drawling voice, can make Enmu's gender seem ambiguous. RELATED: Who Is Upper-Rank One in Demon Slayer?                Despite that, Enmu is, in fact, male -- and one with sadistic tendencies. He is one of the few demons throughout Demon Slayer that appears totally irredeemable, because he enjoys watching the suffering of humans.  His utter devotion to Muzan was also what saved Enmu when faced with impending death. While the rest of the Lower Moons begged for their lives, or tried to save themselves from slaughter, Enmu faced Muzan with an expression of reverence. That deviation was outside of Muzan\u2019s expectations. As a character who enjoys feeling superior, Muzan spared Enmu, and instead gave him more blood -- and another opportunity to prove himself. Enmu took that opportunity, and his newfound power, to hatch a nefarious plot. He merged with the Mugen Train, intending to take its passengers as his victims. Most of Enmu\u2019s skills center around his ability to manipulate dreams and reality. He can put people to sleep in his dream realm and show them beautiful, idealistic visions, or present them with the most heart-wrenching nightmares. It's that dynamic that challenges Tanjiro\u2019s fortitude throughout the Mugen Train Arc.  RELATED: Why Does Muzan Hate Doma of the Twelve Kizuki in Demon Slayer?                When Tanjiro and his companions boarded the train to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances, Enmu dragged them into a dream realm with the intent of killing them in their sleep. However, he cruelly borrowed the hands of four vulnerable children with terminal illnesses to perform that deed, luring them with the promise of an eternity of happy dreams. Tanjiro found himself in a world of peace where his family is alive and well, a reality he had long wished for, but one that he cannot regain. Despite how easy it would have been to simply lose himself in this false but idealistic world, with the assistance of Nezuko, Tanjiro forced himself back to reality.  That is the true cruelty of Enmu. He takes advantage of people\u2019s deepest desires and regrets, and turns it against them. His utter devotion to Muzan, as well as his genuine enjoyment of human suffering, separates him from other demons.                  Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family?

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 1 of The Rising of the Shield Hero, \"A New Roar,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season returns to continue the isekai adventure of The Rising of the Shield Hero's unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi. By the end of Season 1, however, Naofumi's fortunes had reversed. Now as Season 2 begins, he takes another important step forward by adding a new member to his adventurer party, Rishia, who already has much-needed experience battling the deadly Waves.  However, Rishia comes with her own baggage. Her original party leader, the Bow Hero Itsuki, rejects her as a foolish weakling, so now she clings to Naofumi as her new leader and is desperate to prove herself. Naofumi welcomes Rishia to his party but it won't be easy, and she makes a difficult choice in order to attain more power. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters                Season 2, Episode 1 of Shield Hero finds Naofumi's party working hard to help prepare Lurolona village's defenses for the inevitable next Wave. The tanuki girl Raphtalia feels more prepared for action than ever, and the same is true for Filo. By contrast, the green-haired Rishia struggles to prove her worth, though she does have some talent with controlling her qi energy during a practice session. Suddenly a swarm of oversized bats attacks, and it's up to everyone except Rishia to fight them off.  Rishia feels inadequate compared to everyone around her, and her insecurities mount as she repeatedly fails to fight for Naofumi or impress any of the Cardinal Heroes. She is practically trapped in a vicious cycle of her weak performance undermining her confidence, which in turn destabilizes her performance as an adventurer. This might only get worse as Naofumi's adventure continues, but fortunately for Rishia, her new leader actually looks out for his companions. Raphtalia shares Naofumi's generous spirit and offers to help Rishia power up in time for the next Wave -- but her chosen method may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, including Naofumi. The party heads to the same well-dressed slave trader in the capital city who had sold Raphtalia to Naofumi months ago, and Raphtalia recommends that Rishia get a slave crest to become a formal -- and stronger -- member of the party. Naofumi objects at first but Rishia insists, so he and the slave trader follow through and add the crest. As hoped, Rishia's stats receive an immediate boost, and Naofumi's RPG-style HUD gets updates on her status. There's no going back now.  RELATED: How Shield Hero Reinvents the Beach Episode Concept, Isekai Style                Rishia's decision to willingly get a slave crest placed on her says a few things about her and Naofumi alike. Her willingness to get this type of power-boost -- and Naofumi's hesitation to give her one -- shows that he has lost his taste for slave crests and slavery as a whole since Shield Hero started, which is a change for the better. Earlier on he was desperate for allies and resources, and at the time he had no qualms about buying Raphtalia and using her crest to discipline her. Now Naofumi has more assets and allies than ever. That, combined with his better attitude after getting his name cleared of that false crime, means he has a new mindset. He is no longer a bitter pragmatist but a proper role model and father figure to his party, and he won't use slave crests unless the other person demands it.  In addition, Rishia's actions suggest she is the new Naofumi: an unfortunate and desperate adventurer who will pay any price to get what she needs to survive, even resorting to slavery and cruel magic. The main difference is that Rishia wanted the slave crest for herself instead of putting it on someone else. It shows remarkable resolve and commitment, but also a low sense of self-worth. For now, her desperation and low self-esteem define her character arc in Shield Hero, but if she can score some victories in upcoming Waves, that may soon change -- and she might even rethink her slave crest.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 1 of The Rising of the Shield Hero, \"A New Roar,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season returns to continue the isekai adventure of The Rising of the Shield Hero's unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi. By the end of Season 1, however, Naofumi's fortunes had reversed. Now as Season 2 begins, he takes another important step forward by adding a new member to his adventurer party, Rishia, who already has much-needed experience battling the deadly Waves.  However, Rishia comes with her own baggage. Her original party leader, the Bow Hero Itsuki, rejects her as a foolish weakling, so now she clings to Naofumi as her new leader and is desperate to prove herself. Naofumi welcomes Rishia to his party but it won't be easy, and she makes a difficult choice in order to attain more power. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters                Season 2, Episode 1 of Shield Hero finds Naofumi's party working hard to help prepare Lurolona village's defenses for the inevitable next Wave. The tanuki girl Raphtalia feels more prepared for action than ever, and the same is true for Filo. By contrast, the green-haired Rishia struggles to prove her worth, though she does have some talent with controlling her qi energy during a practice session. Suddenly a swarm of oversized bats attacks, and it's up to everyone except Rishia to fight them off.  Rishia feels inadequate compared to everyone around her, and her insecurities mount as she repeatedly fails to fight for Naofumi or impress any of the Cardinal Heroes. She is practically trapped in a vicious cycle of her weak performance undermining her confidence, which in turn destabilizes her performance as an adventurer. This might only get worse as Naofumi's adventure continues, but fortunately for Rishia, her new leader actually looks out for his companions. Raphtalia shares Naofumi's generous spirit and offers to help Rishia power up in time for the next Wave -- but her chosen method may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, including Naofumi. The party heads to the same well-dressed slave trader in the capital city who had sold Raphtalia to Naofumi months ago, and Raphtalia recommends that Rishia get a slave crest to become a formal -- and stronger -- member of the party. Naofumi objects at first but Rishia insists, so he and the slave trader follow through and add the crest. As hoped, Rishia's stats receive an immediate boost, and Naofumi's RPG-style HUD gets updates on her status. There's no going back now.  RELATED: How Shield Hero Reinvents the Beach Episode Concept, Isekai Style                Rishia's decision to willingly get a slave crest placed on her says a few things about her and Naofumi alike. Her willingness to get this type of power-boost -- and Naofumi's hesitation to give her one -- shows that he has lost his taste for slave crests and slavery as a whole since Shield Hero started, which is a change for the better. Earlier on he was desperate for allies and resources, and at the time he had no qualms about buying Raphtalia and using her crest to discipline her. Now Naofumi has more assets and allies than ever. That, combined with his better attitude after getting his name cleared of that false crime, means he has a new mindset. He is no longer a bitter pragmatist but a proper role model and father figure to his party, and he won't use slave crests unless the other person demands it.  In addition, Rishia's actions suggest she is the new Naofumi: an unfortunate and desperate adventurer who will pay any price to get what she needs to survive, even resorting to slavery and cruel magic. The main difference is that Rishia wanted the slave crest for herself instead of putting it on someone else. It shows remarkable resolve and commitment, but also a low sense of self-worth. For now, her desperation and low self-esteem define her character arc in Shield Hero, but if she can score some victories in upcoming Waves, that may soon change -- and she might even rethink her slave crest.

Marvil's Devil's Reign #6   Artist  Marco Checchetto    Colorist  Marcio Menyz    Cover Artist  Marco Checchetto, Marcio Menyz    Letterer  VC's Clayton Cowles    Price  5.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Chip Zdarsky      The con is up. The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart. Joe, the last remaining purple child, confronts his father in a heated battle, while an angry Daredevil savagely beats up\u00a0the disgraced Mayor. Writer Chip Zdarsky mixes that inner conflict with rage and grief, interlacing Daredevil\u2019s self-questioning narration over the events. Often, when drowning in despair, even the heroes can lose their way, but it is worth remembering that saving one's own soul is saving a life as well.  The artwork of Devil's Reign #6 is an orchestra of swashbuckling action, imposing panels, and pensive closeups. Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Marvil's Devil's Reign #6   Artist  Marco Checchetto    Colorist  Marcio Menyz    Cover Artist  Marco Checchetto, Marcio Menyz    Letterer  VC's Clayton Cowles    Price  5.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Chip Zdarsky      The con is up. The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart. Joe, the last remaining purple child, confronts his father in a heated battle, while an angry Daredevil savagely beats up\u00a0the disgraced Mayor. Writer Chip Zdarsky mixes that inner conflict with rage and grief, interlacing Daredevil\u2019s self-questioning narration over the events. Often, when drowning in despair, even the heroes can lose their way, but it is worth remembering that saving one's own soul is saving a life as well.  The artwork of Devil's Reign #6 is an orchestra of swashbuckling action, imposing panels, and pensive closeups. Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett hoped Lara Croft will finally let go of her past in the next entry of Square Enix's video game saga.  While Pratchett confirmed she wouldn't be working on the next title in the Tomb Raider series, she's still eager to see how the upcoming entry will handle Lara Croft's story. According to Eurogamer, Pratchett wanted Lara to move past the specter of her father Richard, whose death paved the way for the events of the reboot trilogy. \"We had a really fun time evolving her character, so I would like to see probably less father issues,\" she said. Related: Tomb Raider Announces First Official Tabletop Role-Playing Game Pratchett explained the reboot trilogy's Lara was still in the process of growing into the confident explorer from the original games, calling her a \"proto-Tomb Raider.\" The writer hoped the future of the series will let Lara realize her potential, finally transforming her into the gun-slinging daredevil longtime fans know and love. \"I want to see that full fruition,\" she said. \"I want to see the sassy one-liners and things that I would have loved to have written. But, you know, she wasn't at that stage yet, she didn't have the confidence yet.\"  Lara's father Richard Croft was one of the most important characters in the reboot trilogy and a driving force for Lara's growth throughout the games. Though he loved his daughter dearly, his obsession with his archeological research into the arcane drove a wedge between the two, with Lara even growing to resent her father after his sudden death. When Lara decided to complete his research, his surviving notes guided the young Croft throughout her adventures, allowing her to finally come to peace with his memory during the conclusion of Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Related: Tomb Raider Is the Best Gaming Film Adaptation, Survey Finds  Though nothing has yet been revealed concerning the plot for the new Tomb Raider game, Crystal Dynamics' franchise manager Dallas Dickenson revealed the franchise's latest entry will be powered by Epic Games' Unreal Engine 5. The news of the project's ongoing development came as part of the State of the Unreal showcase, a live stream event announcing the release of Epic Games' next-generation gaming engine. \"Our goal is to push the envelope of fidelity and to deliver the high-quality, cinematic action-adventure experience that fans deserve from both Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider franchise,\" Dickenson said.  The Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett hoped Lara Croft will finally let go of her past in the next entry of Square Enix's video game saga.  While Pratchett confirmed she wouldn't be working on the next title in the Tomb Raider series, she's still eager to see how the upcoming entry will handle Lara Croft's story. According to Eurogamer, Pratchett wanted Lara to move past the specter of her father Richard, whose death paved the way for the events of the reboot trilogy. \"We had a really fun time evolving her character, so I would like to see probably less father issues,\" she said. Related: Tomb Raider Announces First Official Tabletop Role-Playing Game Pratchett explained the reboot trilogy's Lara was still in the process of growing into the confident explorer from the original games, calling her a \"proto-Tomb Raider.\" The writer hoped the future of the series will let Lara realize her potential, finally transforming her into the gun-slinging daredevil longtime fans know and love. \"I want to see that full fruition,\" she said. \"I want to see the sassy one-liners and things that I would have loved to have written. But, you know, she wasn't at that stage yet, she didn't have the confidence yet.\"  Lara's father Richard Croft was one of the most important characters in the reboot trilogy and a driving force for Lara's growth throughout the games. Though he loved his daughter dearly, his obsession with his archeological research into the arcane drove a wedge between the two, with Lara even growing to resent her father after his sudden death. When Lara decided to complete his research, his surviving notes guided the young Croft throughout her adventures, allowing her to finally come to peace with his memory during the conclusion of Shadow of the Tomb Raider.

The news of the project's ongoing development came as part of the State of the Unreal showcase, a live stream event announcing the release of Epic Games' next-generation gaming engine. \"Our goal is to push the envelope of fidelity and to deliver the high-quality, cinematic action-adventure experience that fans deserve from both Crystal Dynamics and the Tomb Raider franchise,\" Dickenson said.  The Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is available for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1   Writer  Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing    Artist  Max Dunbar, Sebastian Cheng    Letterer  Aditya Bidikar    Publisher  DC Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-05      Bruce Wayne is dead, leaving Terry McGinnis to uphold the legacy of Batman. This is the first time Terry will have to go solo without the voice of his mentor and friend guiding him. During the events of Batman: Urban Legends #7, published by DC Comics last year, Bruce's pacemaker overloads and kills him, but not before he gives Terry his blessings. An enraged Terry tears the city apart in search of the culprit, only to come back home to the Batcave and realize it was Gotham itself that killed Bruce. A super-intelligence, dubbed the Neo-Gotham, now runs through the city's veins and has identified Batman as the virus. Written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing with artwork from Max Dunbar and Sebastian Cheng and lettering by Aditya Bidikar, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 starts a new chapter for Batman.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 pits Terry McGinnis against the sentinel AI avatar of Gotham City. It has been two months since Neo-Gotham woke up and killed Bruce Wayne and two months since Terry started his solitary crusade against the criminal element. However, he is nowhere near cleansing the streets of crime or turning Gotham on his side. To add to the predicament, Bruce's other legacy, the Wayne-Powers corporation, is now run by a former crook, the Holographic Man. Batman investigates the new CEO when he comes across a cargo ship carrying drug supplies. As he is about to jump into action, an agent of Neo-Gotham stops him in his tracks. Now he has two choices: stand down or join Gotham in her upcoming genocide.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Beyond the White Knight #1 Comic Review                 Terry McGinnis is at a crossroads in his life. With his mentor gone and the number of allies dwindling, Terry is trying hard to keep the peace in his city while desperately clamoring to keep Bruce's legacy intact. Loneliness has gripped him as Batman is spread thin over Gotham putting out fires. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 envisions a different kind of Gotham, one that is aesthetically techno-modern but has transcended the barriers of technology and is now turning on its own citizens. The only person in its way is its sworn protector. A linear narrative with a heavy emphasis on its protagonist, the story progresses through Terry's point of view, using first-person narrative boxes to explore his inner feelings and resolve. The debut issue of this Batman Beyond reboot does well to provide exposition through character interactions. The action kicks up a notch in the latter half, with new adversaries rearing their heads.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 showcases a neon-lit, futuristic Gotham City filled with high-tech machinery and ultramodern urban architecture. Artist Max Dunbar uses crisp lines and elaborately detailed backgrounds to infuse the pages with animated energy that gives off a cartoonish vibe. To not take away from the seriousness of the plot, Dunbar employs a variety of techniques, from glaring close-ups to brooding panels. However, what catches the eye are the full-length splash pages that frame the characters, new and old, in their natural element. Meanwhile, the coloring best brings out the neo-futuristic aesthetic of the book. Colorist Sebastian Cheng's use of alternate tones of colors to create light and shadow gives depth to the artwork. Cheng douses the Gotham sky in an eternal shade of soothing purple, creating a great contrast with Batman's black and red.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Killing Time #2 Comic Review                 From the get-go, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 never seems to let its foot off the gas, continuing the momentum and suspense that started in the pages of Batman: Urban Legends #7 all the while adding new flavors into the mix as the story progresses. A fan-favorite character, Terry McGinnis is at a rough spot in his life, and it is only going to get tougher. After years of listening to an old grumpy man's voice in his head, Terry has developed an unhealthy habit of speaking to an absent father figure. His grief gives the overlaying narration a melancholic tune. As times get tough, Terry must brace himself as Gotham comes for all that stand against it. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 ends on a narrative hook that is bound to bring readers back for more.

Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1   Writer  Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing    Artist  Max Dunbar, Sebastian Cheng    Letterer  Aditya Bidikar    Publisher  DC Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-05      Bruce Wayne is dead, leaving Terry McGinnis to uphold the legacy of Batman. This is the first time Terry will have to go solo without the voice of his mentor and friend guiding him. During the events of Batman: Urban Legends #7, published by DC Comics last year, Bruce's pacemaker overloads and kills him, but not before he gives Terry his blessings. An enraged Terry tears the city apart in search of the culprit, only to come back home to the Batcave and realize it was Gotham itself that killed Bruce. A super-intelligence, dubbed the Neo-Gotham, now runs through the city's veins and has identified Batman as the virus. Written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing with artwork from Max Dunbar and Sebastian Cheng and lettering by Aditya Bidikar, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 starts a new chapter for Batman.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 pits Terry McGinnis against the sentinel AI avatar of Gotham City. It has been two months since Neo-Gotham woke up and killed Bruce Wayne and two months since Terry started his solitary crusade against the criminal element. However, he is nowhere near cleansing the streets of crime or turning Gotham on his side. To add to the predicament, Bruce's other legacy, the Wayne-Powers corporation, is now run by a former crook, the Holographic Man. Batman investigates the new CEO when he comes across a cargo ship carrying drug supplies. As he is about to jump into action, an agent of Neo-Gotham stops him in his tracks. Now he has two choices: stand down or join Gotham in her upcoming genocide.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Beyond the White Knight #1 Comic Review                 Terry McGinnis is at a crossroads in his life. With his mentor gone and the number of allies dwindling, Terry is trying hard to keep the peace in his city while desperately clamoring to keep Bruce's legacy intact. Loneliness has gripped him as Batman is spread thin over Gotham putting out fires. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 envisions a different kind of Gotham, one that is aesthetically techno-modern but has transcended the barriers of technology and is now turning on its own citizens. The only person in its way is its sworn protector. A linear narrative with a heavy emphasis on its protagonist, the story progresses through Terry's point of view, using first-person narrative boxes to explore his inner feelings and resolve. The debut issue of this Batman Beyond reboot does well to provide exposition through character interactions. The action kicks up a notch in the latter half, with new adversaries rearing their heads.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 showcases a neon-lit, futuristic Gotham City filled with high-tech machinery and ultramodern urban architecture. Artist Max Dunbar uses crisp lines and elaborately detailed backgrounds to infuse the pages with animated energy that gives off a cartoonish vibe. To not take away from the seriousness of the plot, Dunbar employs a variety of techniques, from glaring close-ups to brooding panels. However, what catches the eye are the full-length splash pages that frame the characters, new and old, in their natural element. Meanwhile, the coloring best brings out the neo-futuristic aesthetic of the book. Colorist Sebastian Cheng's use of alternate tones of colors to create light and shadow gives depth to the artwork. Cheng douses the Gotham sky in an eternal shade of soothing purple, creating a great contrast with Batman's black and red.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Killing Time #2 Comic Review                 From the get-go, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 never seems to let its foot off the gas, continuing the momentum and suspense that started in the pages of Batman: Urban Legends #7 all the while adding new flavors into the mix as the story progresses. A fan-favorite character, Terry McGinnis is at a rough spot in his life, and it is only going to get tougher. After years of listening to an old grumpy man's voice in his head, Terry has developed an unhealthy habit of speaking to an absent father figure. His grief gives the overlaying narration a melancholic tune. As times get tough, Terry must brace himself as Gotham comes for all that stand against it. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 ends on a narrative hook that is bound to bring readers back for more.

Here's a look back at the anime's biggest plot twists so far.                 My Dress-Up Darling was a smash-hit rom-com anime in the Winter 2022 season, starring the lively cosplay enthusiast Kitagawa Marin and her new partner, the shy but hardworking Gojo Wakana. They soon embarked on an educational and uplifting journey into the world of cosplay together, and both gained a lot from it.  The story of My Dress-Up Darling is told in just 12 episodes, but it still managed to pack in some intriguing and meaningful plot twists and developments that kept the series moving at a healthy pace. Fans can look back fondly and remember the most impactful plot twists that helped the story and its characters along. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022          When Gojo Agreed to Make a Shizuka-Tan Cosplay For Marin                When Gojo and Marin first met early in My Dress-Up Darling, Marin made a request: for Gojo the doll maker to become her cosplay expert and help her make a costume of her favorite Slippery Girls 2 character, Shizuka-Tan. This request is what helped forge their new friendship, and Gojo accepted the challenge with relish.  The project helped establish their friendship, but also showed how devoted Gojo is to his craft. He amazed Marin when he pushed himself to finish her cosplay in record time, which helped set the tone for his character going forward. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship          When Gojo Called Marin Beautiful                After Gojo worked so hard on her cosplay, Marin went ahead and attended a cosplay event where everyone was getting their picture taken. On the train ride home, Gojo off-handedly remarked on Marin's beauty, since he, as a hina doll maker, equates it with quality and good craftsmanship. In his eyes, Marin was like a high-quality, living hina doll -- but Marin took it differently.  This was a love confession to her ears, and it changed the tone of their platonic friendship. Flattered, Marin developed an immediate and innocent crush on Gojo and maintained those feelings throughout the show, to the point of becoming jealously possessive. She even made the trademark yandere stare at one point, though no one was around to see it. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes          When Gojo Combined His Two Hobbies To Improve His Skills                As My Dress-Up Darling continued, Gojo had to put his hina doll hobby on hold to make time for cosplay with Marin, and it was just as well. He had hit a wall with hina dolls after struggling to paint their faces correctly, but to his pleasant surprise, he learned that he could actually combine his hobbies.  By putting on Marin's cosplay makeup multiple times, Gojo became better at cosmetics, which meant he could paint hina doll faces better than ever. His hobbies had become more than the sum of their parts, boding well for his future with each hobby. Gojo's growth was quicker than many expected. RELATED: The My Dress-Up Darling Anime's Biggest Changes From the Manga          When Inui Sajuna Joined My Dress-Up Darling's Cast                Marin's cosplay role model and idol, the popular cosplayer Inui Sajuna, arrived to help Marin and Gojo take their hobby to the next level. In particular, she wanted Gojo to make a custom costume for her with his trademark quality. Along the way, Sajuna and her new friends learned much from one another.  Gojo and Marin both learned new strategies for costume creation and photography from Sajuna, while she in turn learned the value of homemade cosplay from Gojo and came to appreciate his expert technique. Having Sajuna was a distinct leap forward for Marin and Gojo's budding cosplay career together. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork          When Inui Shinju Decided To Cosplay, Too                Sajuna's little sister Shinju was content to be her supporter and little more, with the latter lacking the confidence to try cosplay on her own. After meeting Gojo and Marin, however, Shinju finally worked up the courage to try her first cosplay, showing remarkable character growth. She amazed everyone in My Dress-Up Darling with her crossplay as a dark-haired male anime character, and is now a confident cosplayer who is ready to show off what she can do to the world.

Here's a look back at the anime's biggest plot twists so far.                 My Dress-Up Darling was a smash-hit rom-com anime in the Winter 2022 season, starring the lively cosplay enthusiast Kitagawa Marin and her new partner, the shy but hardworking Gojo Wakana. They soon embarked on an educational and uplifting journey into the world of cosplay together, and both gained a lot from it.  The story of My Dress-Up Darling is told in just 12 episodes, but it still managed to pack in some intriguing and meaningful plot twists and developments that kept the series moving at a healthy pace. Fans can look back fondly and remember the most impactful plot twists that helped the story and its characters along. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022          When Gojo Agreed to Make a Shizuka-Tan Cosplay For Marin                When Gojo and Marin first met early in My Dress-Up Darling, Marin made a request: for Gojo the doll maker to become her cosplay expert and help her make a costume of her favorite Slippery Girls 2 character, Shizuka-Tan. This request is what helped forge their new friendship, and Gojo accepted the challenge with relish.  The project helped establish their friendship, but also showed how devoted Gojo is to his craft. He amazed Marin when he pushed himself to finish her cosplay in record time, which helped set the tone for his character going forward. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship          When Gojo Called Marin Beautiful                After Gojo worked so hard on her cosplay, Marin went ahead and attended a cosplay event where everyone was getting their picture taken. On the train ride home, Gojo off-handedly remarked on Marin's beauty, since he, as a hina doll maker, equates it with quality and good craftsmanship. In his eyes, Marin was like a high-quality, living hina doll -- but Marin took it differently.  This was a love confession to her ears, and it changed the tone of their platonic friendship. Flattered, Marin developed an immediate and innocent crush on Gojo and maintained those feelings throughout the show, to the point of becoming jealously possessive. She even made the trademark yandere stare at one point, though no one was around to see it. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes          When Gojo Combined His Two Hobbies To Improve His Skills                As My Dress-Up Darling continued, Gojo had to put his hina doll hobby on hold to make time for cosplay with Marin, and it was just as well. He had hit a wall with hina dolls after struggling to paint their faces correctly, but to his pleasant surprise, he learned that he could actually combine his hobbies.  By putting on Marin's cosplay makeup multiple times, Gojo became better at cosmetics, which meant he could paint hina doll faces better than ever. His hobbies had become more than the sum of their parts, boding well for his future with each hobby. Gojo's growth was quicker than many expected. RELATED: The My Dress-Up Darling Anime's Biggest Changes From the Manga          When Inui Sajuna Joined My Dress-Up Darling's Cast                Marin's cosplay role model and idol, the popular cosplayer Inui Sajuna, arrived to help Marin and Gojo take their hobby to the next level. In particular, she wanted Gojo to make a custom costume for her with his trademark quality. Along the way, Sajuna and her new friends learned much from one another.  Gojo and Marin both learned new strategies for costume creation and photography from Sajuna, while she in turn learned the value of homemade cosplay from Gojo and came to appreciate his expert technique. Having Sajuna was a distinct leap forward for Marin and Gojo's budding cosplay career together. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork          When Inui Shinju Decided To Cosplay, Too                Sajuna's little sister Shinju was content to be her supporter and little more, with the latter lacking the confidence to try cosplay on her own. After meeting Gojo and Marin, however, Shinju finally worked up the courage to try her first cosplay, showing remarkable character growth. She amazed everyone in My Dress-Up Darling with her crossplay as a dark-haired male anime character, and is now a confident cosplayer who is ready to show off what she can do to the world.

Audiences recently got a new look at Jurassic World Dominion's newest dinosaur, Giganotosaurus, and the havoc it will wreak on modern day human civilization.  Released via Empire, a new still from the third Jurassic World film features the Giganotosaurus terrorizing the film's star cast, huddled below the wreckage of a car. These heroes include Chris Pratt's Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing and the returning original cast from the Jurassic Park films: Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neill as Ian Malcolm, Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant, respectively. RELATED: Jurassic World: Dominion Set Video Shows Off the Film's 'Incredible Craftsmanship'                Director Colin Trevorrow touched on the Giganotosaurus and its depiction in the upcoming film, interestingly comparing the ancient reptile to the iconic supervillain, the Joker. He said, \"I wanted something that felt like the Joker... It just wants to watch the world burn.\"  The director also revealed some of the major points of the film's plot. Trevorrow stated, \"BioSyn got the contract to house the dinosaurs that have been captured around the world via various governments... They claim it's a research facility where they can study the pharmaceutical values of the animals. But there\u2019s some other stuff going on.\" RELATED: Jurassic World 3 Teases Closure for the Franchise\u2019s Biggest Romance Mistake Jurassic World Dominion is set to take place four years after the events of Fallen Kingdom, after Isla Nublar was destroyed and the island's dinosaurs were unleashed on the American continent, forcing both humans and dinosaurs to adapt to the new world. Previous stills, as well as Trevorrow's short film, Battle at Big Rock, shed light on what that struggle will look like.  Dominion will also see dinosaurs biologically adapt to their newfound freedom, with one poster for the film unveiling Blue the raptor's clone/child, Beta. While the new dinosaurs and improved designs may be some facets of Dominion audiences are excited about, a lot of the focus is on the return of the iconic Jurassic Park trio, who each appeared in sequels but have not appeared together in a Jurassic Park film since the 1993 original. Additionally, while Ian Malcolm previously appeared in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler have not been seen since 2001's Jurassic Park III.  Universal Pictures' upcoming instalment is also unique for being the franchise's longest film. It was recently reported that Dominion will have a runtime of approximately 147 minutes-- almost twenty minutes longer than the second-longest film in the saga, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which ran at 128 minutes. Jurassic World Dominion is set to roar into theaters on June 10. Source: Empire                  Did Moon Knight Have His Own Manga in the 1970s?

Audiences recently got a new look at Jurassic World Dominion's newest dinosaur, Giganotosaurus, and the havoc it will wreak on modern day human civilization.  Released via Empire, a new still from the third Jurassic World film features the Giganotosaurus terrorizing the film's star cast, huddled below the wreckage of a car. These heroes include Chris Pratt's Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing and the returning original cast from the Jurassic Park films: Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neill as Ian Malcolm, Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant, respectively. RELATED: Jurassic World: Dominion Set Video Shows Off the Film's 'Incredible Craftsmanship'                Director Colin Trevorrow touched on the Giganotosaurus and its depiction in the upcoming film, interestingly comparing the ancient reptile to the iconic supervillain, the Joker. He said, \"I wanted something that felt like the Joker... It just wants to watch the world burn.\"  The director also revealed some of the major points of the film's plot. Trevorrow stated, \"BioSyn got the contract to house the dinosaurs that have been captured around the world via various governments... They claim it's a research facility where they can study the pharmaceutical values of the animals. But there\u2019s some other stuff going on.\" RELATED: Jurassic World 3 Teases Closure for the Franchise\u2019s Biggest Romance Mistake Jurassic World Dominion is set to take place four years after the events of Fallen Kingdom, after Isla Nublar was destroyed and the island's dinosaurs were unleashed on the American continent, forcing both humans and dinosaurs to adapt to the new world. Previous stills, as well as Trevorrow's short film, Battle at Big Rock, shed light on what that struggle will look like.  Dominion will also see dinosaurs biologically adapt to their newfound freedom, with one poster for the film unveiling Blue the raptor's clone/child, Beta. While the new dinosaurs and improved designs may be some facets of Dominion audiences are excited about, a lot of the focus is on the return of the iconic Jurassic Park trio, who each appeared in sequels but have not appeared together in a Jurassic Park film since the 1993 original. Additionally, while Ian Malcolm previously appeared in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler have not been seen since 2001's Jurassic Park III.  Universal Pictures' upcoming instalment is also unique for being the franchise's longest film. It was recently reported that Dominion will have a runtime of approximately 147 minutes-- almost twenty minutes longer than the second-longest film in the saga, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which ran at 128 minutes. Jurassic World Dominion is set to roar into theaters on June 10. Source: Empire                  Did Moon Knight Have His Own Manga in the 1970s?

It seems safe to assume that pop culture will be dominated by reactions to the COVID Pandemic for years to come. Author Michael Moreci has already taken a significant amount of inspiration from the challenges of recent years. He and fellow author Tim Seeley recently worked together to create an apocalyptic horror movie. And now, Moreci has teamed up with artist Alessandro Vitti and AWA Studios to present a new five-part series set in the same universe as J. Michael Straczynski and Michael Deodato's The Resistance. The Joneses #1 is a compelling first issue that introduces readers to a new family of superheroes.  The Joneses #1 follows the Jones family as they struggle to balance their newfound superpowers with their everyday lives in an increasingly divided social climate. Many of their neighbors believe that people with superpowers are responsible for a recent public health crisis, known as \"the Great Death,\" that ravaged the world, so the Joneses are forced to hide who they really are even from their closest friends. As if that wasn't enough stress, the matriarch of the family is having an increasingly difficult time controlling her powers. As tensions rise, dangerous super villains emerge and each member of the family is forced to make difficult decisions.  Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                 Many readers will see shades of the real world in The Joneses #1. Moreci isn't subtle about the parallels between his fiction and reality. \"The Great Death\" feels like a hyperbolic version of the COVID pandemic. Similarly, the divisive nature of public discourse in The Joneses #1 seems to echo the state of the real world. This allegorical approach makes it easy for the reader to acclimate to the world of the comic, giving Moreci the freedom to flesh out his characters. As this first issue unfolds, he reveals more and more about the family's tense, but endearing dynamic. There is something cathartic about watching as a family tackles their personal problems in the wake of a global health crisis.  Vitti's art captures the tone of Moreci's work perfectly. His ability to depict a wide emotional range helps Moreci build tension throughout the numerous difficult conversations that comprise The Joneses #1. He's just as great at capturing the spirit of the landscape. His depictions of suburban Illinois evoke a quiet, almost pastoral feeling until further inspection reveals something sinister lurking behind the cookie-cutter houses. But Vitti's work really comes to life in the action sequences. He draws the daughter's super speed with a frenetic, excitable line that communicates the scope of her power while adding to the overall composition of each page.  Related: IDW's The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 Comic Review                 The Joneses #1 is a well-crafted, thoughtful meditation on life in the aftermath of catastrophe. It functions both as a satirical analysis of the current cultural zeitgeist and a good old-fashioned superhero story. Moreci and Vitti are both firing on all cylinders in this first issue, that has something in it for everyone.

By Marc York Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Here's everything there is to know about the Ackerman bloodline of Attack on Titan, including what they are and what they can do.            Ackerman Family      The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   Attack on Titan: The Final Season has brought a number of big surprises to the table, especially as they pertain to the Ackermans. Eren, in particular, had a lot to say about the clan, although he used this information to force Mikasa to hate her. He told the poor girl that her feelings for him were an instinctive part of her Ackerman blood rather than genuinely-developed feelings of affection. This, among other things Eren said, broke Mikasa's heart, but it might not have been true.  The last episode of The Final Season Part 2 reveals a different explanation from Zeke. The sum of his information suggests that Mikasa's feelings are, in fact, genuine and have nothing to do with her lineage. Eren's apparent lies have made the truth about the Ackermans hard to follow for fans. In order to clear things up, here's a look at everything there is to know about the Ackerman family. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                Historically, the Ackermans were meant to live in service to the Eldian royal family. However, after the fall of Eldia, they rejected King Fritz's idea of peace, so they were persecuted and hunted to near-extinction. It was only after Kenny Ackerman met Uri Reiss, then the reigning king, that the purge stopped.  The Ackerman family was created through experimentation by the old Eldian Empire on the Subjects of Ymir. As a result of this experimentation, the Ackermans were granted the ability to use the Power of the Titans while in human form. This is most observable in their practically-superhuman feats, including Mikasa's strength and Levi's ability to survive a point-blank Thunder Spear. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Historia's Fate Parallels Grisha'sThe Ackermans are also immune to the memory manipulation of the Founding Titan, which is how they retained their memories of life before the Walls. This is also partly the reason they were able to reject King Fritz's ideals; if they could be forced to forget, they wouldn't even know what there was to be against. This inability to be controlled is what led King Fritz to hunt them down to a handful.  Another ability of the Ackermans is to be \"awakened.\" Besides their superhuman abilities, they also gain the battle experience of previous Ackermans through the paths. This is what makes them so proficient in combat, especially Levi \"Humanity's Strongest Soldier\" Ackerman. The only caveat is that the Ackermans need to be awakened by their instinct to survive. Mikasa exemplified this when she was nine and Eren told her to \"fight\" as they were attacked by robbers. By tapping into her hidden potential, she could crush a knife grip, break floorboards, and stab a robber through the heart from behind. If her life wasn't put in danger, she would have remained an ordinary little girl.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Solves the Colossal Titans' Biggest Weakness According to Eren, however, there was another cause for this awakening. In Episode 14 of The Final Season, \"Savagery,\" Eren said that the awakening was caused in response to an Ackerman's instinct to defend a \"host.\" This could be seen as plausible as many of the Ackermans could also be said to have hosts; for Levi, it would have been Erwin Smith; for Kenny, there was Uri. All the Ackermans who went on to be warriors had somebody they wanted to protect. Eren further backed his claim about Ackerman instincts by citing Mikasa's headaches. According to him, the headaches are caused by the Ackermans' true personalities trying to oppose the host. He went on to say that Mikasa's inclination to follow her Ackerman blood, and thus not be free, was what made him hate her.  Later, however, Armin suggested to Mikasa that Eren might have been lying about all of this. In Episode 18, \"Sneak Attack,\" he put forth that He and Eren had known about Mikasa's headaches for a long time. He went on to suggest that Eren used that one truth to make the rest of what he said sound convincing. For all they knew, everything else Eren said was a lie. While this uncertainty about what was and wasn't true comforted Mikasa, it was also the source of a lot of confusion among the fans. RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                 Thankfully, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" helped to discern fact from fiction. In a flashback, Eren was shown having a conversation with Zeke Yeager about the cause of Mikasa's devotion to him. While awakening through triggered survival instincts was confirmed to be true through research, there was no evidence that it had anything to do with headaches or a host. In Zeke's humble opinion, Mikasa's faithfulness was simply because she liked Eren. In any case, the Ackermans are an incredible family. Their strength, instinct for battle, and immunity to the Founder's powers make them a force to be reckoned with. With all that said, the cause of Mikasa's headaches remains a mystery.

Attack on Titan: What Is an Ackerman, Anyway?  By Marc York Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Here's everything there is to know about the Ackerman bloodline of Attack on Titan, including what they are and what they can do.            Ackerman Family      The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   Attack on Titan: The Final Season has brought a number of big surprises to the table, especially as they pertain to the Ackermans. Eren, in particular, had a lot to say about the clan, although he used this information to force Mikasa to hate her. He told the poor girl that her feelings for him were an instinctive part of her Ackerman blood rather than genuinely-developed feelings of affection. This, among other things Eren said, broke Mikasa's heart, but it might not have been true.  The last episode of The Final Season Part 2 reveals a different explanation from Zeke. The sum of his information suggests that Mikasa's feelings are, in fact, genuine and have nothing to do with her lineage. Eren's apparent lies have made the truth about the Ackermans hard to follow for fans. In order to clear things up, here's a look at everything there is to know about the Ackerman family. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                Historically, the Ackermans were meant to live in service to the Eldian royal family. However, after the fall of Eldia, they rejected King Fritz's idea of peace, so they were persecuted and hunted to near-extinction. It was only after Kenny Ackerman met Uri Reiss, then the reigning king, that the purge stopped.  The Ackerman family was created through experimentation by the old Eldian Empire on the Subjects of Ymir. As a result of this experimentation, the Ackermans were granted the ability to use the Power of the Titans while in human form. This is most observable in their practically-superhuman feats, including Mikasa's strength and Levi's ability to survive a point-blank Thunder Spear. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Historia's Fate Parallels Grisha'sThe Ackermans are also immune to the memory manipulation of the Founding Titan, which is how they retained their memories of life before the Walls. This is also partly the reason they were able to reject King Fritz's ideals; if they could be forced to forget, they wouldn't even know what there was to be against. This inability to be controlled is what led King Fritz to hunt them down to a handful.  Another ability of the Ackermans is to be \"awakened.\" Besides their superhuman abilities, they also gain the battle experience of previous Ackermans through the paths. This is what makes them so proficient in combat, especially Levi \"Humanity's Strongest Soldier\" Ackerman. The only caveat is that the Ackermans need to be awakened by their instinct to survive. Mikasa exemplified this when she was nine and Eren told her to \"fight\" as they were attacked by robbers. By tapping into her hidden potential, she could crush a knife grip, break floorboards, and stab a robber through the heart from behind. If her life wasn't put in danger, she would have remained an ordinary little girl.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Solves the Colossal Titans' Biggest Weakness According to Eren, however, there was another cause for this awakening. In Episode 14 of The Final Season, \"Savagery,\" Eren said that the awakening was caused in response to an Ackerman's instinct to defend a \"host.\" This could be seen as plausible as many of the Ackermans could also be said to have hosts; for Levi, it would have been Erwin Smith; for Kenny, there was Uri. All the Ackermans who went on to be warriors had somebody they wanted to protect. Eren further backed his claim about Ackerman instincts by citing Mikasa's headaches. According to him, the headaches are caused by the Ackermans' true personalities trying to oppose the host. He went on to say that Mikasa's inclination to follow her Ackerman blood, and thus not be free, was what made him hate her.  Later, however, Armin suggested to Mikasa that Eren might have been lying about all of this. In Episode 18, \"Sneak Attack,\" he put forth that He and Eren had known about Mikasa's headaches for a long time. He went on to suggest that Eren used that one truth to make the rest of what he said sound convincing. For all they knew, everything else Eren said was a lie. While this uncertainty about what was and wasn't true comforted Mikasa, it was also the source of a lot of confusion among the fans. RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                 Thankfully, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" helped to discern fact from fiction. In a flashback, Eren was shown having a conversation with Zeke Yeager about the cause of Mikasa's devotion to him. While awakening through triggered survival instincts was confirmed to be true through research, there was no evidence that it had anything to do with headaches or a host. In Zeke's humble opinion, Mikasa's faithfulness was simply because she liked Eren. In any case, the Ackermans are an incredible family. Their strength, instinct for battle, and immunity to the Founder's powers make them a force to be reckoned with. With all that said, the cause of Mikasa's headaches remains a mystery.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2.A talented fan of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan used special effects to transform himself into one of the series' titular monsters and then... ate himself.  Posted on the ProductionCrate YouTube channel, the creator, who identifies himself as Mike, walks viewers through the process of how he created the Titan-version of himself. He covers the many steps, including creating a 3D model of his head, the necessary color map and the uncanny proportions of the body. The video ends with a sequence of Titan-Mike chasing Human-Mike and biting his head off. While there is no blood, the sound effects give the action a gruesome, evocative edge. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Mikasa and Annie Debate Killing Eren in Exclusive Final Season Clip    Attack of Titan is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans hide from Titans -- giant, man-eating monsters -- in walled cities. The story focuses primarily on Eren Yeager, a young man who desires to destroy all Titans after one devours his mother. While early parts of the narrative appear to frame Eren as the hero, towards the end, he transitions to a full-blown, genocidal villain.  The Attack on Titan manga series was published in Kodansha's Bessatsu Sh\u014dnen Magazine from 2009 to 2021, and it won several prominent awards, including Best Sh\u014dnen Manga at the Kodansha Manga Awards in 2011. The story was adapted into an anime with the first season premiering in 2013. Wit Studio produced the first three seasons and MAPPA is creating the fourth and final season. RELATED: Attack on Titan Cosplayer Recreates Colossal Titan With Household Materials Attack on Titan: The Final Season has been split into multiple parts. Part 1 premiered in December 2020, Part 2 debuted in January 2022 and it was recently revealed that Attack on Titan: The Final Season would return in 2023 for a third part. While this news undoubtedly excited the anime's passionate fans, it wasn't wholly unexpected. Prior to the release of Part 2's finale, many questioned the anime's ability to satisfyingly wrap the story in a single episode.  There have been other developments in the Attack on Titan franchise apart from impressive works of fan-made content and the confirmation of Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 3. Most notably, the popular virtual rollercoaster based on the series, Attack on Titan XR Ride, which first ran in 2020, is returning for this year's Universal Cool Japan. The manga series was also one of the featured titles in the launch of MangaPlaza, one of the largest digital libraries in the US. Attack on Titan is available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Funimation and Crunchyroll.

Marvel Studios altered a poster for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness that was released in Italy, as it featured a hand gesture considered by many in the country to be offensive.  Shared on Reddit, a poster for the upcoming film showed Benedict Cumberbatch's Master of the Mystic Arts flashing a hand gesture known by some as the symbol for rock and roll. However, for others, it is known as \"the horns,\" which can have several different meanings depending on the country or region. In Italy and other Mediterranean countries, the gesture, with fingers angled downwards and not directed at another person, is used to ward off bad luck or \"the evil eye.\"     RELATED: Doctor Strange 2's Main Villain Both Is and Isn't Who Fans Expected  In the Italian version of the Doctor Strange poster, Steven's left hand gesture has been changed because the original one has a very different meaning here in Italy ... from marvelstudios  However, when pointed upward (as it is in the poster), or aggressively at another person, it is considered an offensive way to call someone a \"cuckold.\" Marvel Studios has edited the Italian poster so that Doctor Strange is giving a peace sign instead.  Multiverse of Madness wrapped extensive reshoots in January 2021 with the additional material helmed by director Sam Raimi and Loki writer Michael Waldron. Raimi took over directorial duties from Scott Derrickson, who directed the first film and departed the sequel over creative differences. Following the success of Spider-Man: No Way Home, it was reported that Multiverse of Madness would have \"more fun with the multiverse,\" with reshoots for the film including even more cameos and character introductions than originally intended. RELATED: Doctor Strange 2's First Day Ticket Sales Crush The Batman - And Almost Everyone Else  Cumberbatch has commented on the scale of the production, stating that he was not entirely sure if the sequel was really \"his\" movie. \"There's a lot of stuff going on in it,\" he said. \"It's like, do I have a character arc in this? Is it working? No, there's great stuff for me to do. It's very busy. It's called The Multiverse of Madness, and it's bonkers.\" The first trailer for Multiverse of Madness teased everything that Phase 4 of the MCU has been headed towards, depicting not only a possible team-up between Doctor Strange, Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch and Wong, but the MCU debut of America Chavez/Miss America (Xochitl Gomez). Multiverse of Madness will not only pick up after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home but will tie directly into two of Marvel's Disney+ series, WandaVision and Loki, both of which dealt heavily with the multiverse.  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness premieres in theaters on May 6, 2022.

The following contains spoilers for Tomodachi Game Episode 1, \"Huh? Yuichi-kun Suspects His Friends?,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   High-stakes games have become a commonplace narrative in anime, video games and live-action shows. Many of the most popular of these titles pit complete strangers against each other in a series of deadly competitions or some sort of mutual killing battle royale. Tomodachi Game, one of this season's newest suspense series, delivers a similar structure by forcing high schoolers to play games with each other's fates on the line.  However, in comparison to many of its contemporaries, Tomodachi Game has two big differences. First, rather than the characters wagering their survival, they risk their futures in the form of life-ruining debt. Second, the participants are all people that they believed to be their best friends. RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul The series opens with the unassuming protagonist Yuuichi Katakiri and his tight-knit student friend group. This posse consists of the carefree rich boy Makoto Shibe, the stern vice class representative Shiho Sawaragi, the prodigious smart guy Tenji Mikasa and the caring wallflower Yutori Kokorogi. While the five share a deep bond, suspicion arises around them after two million yen is stolen from the class' school trip funds.  Following this incident, all five of them receive a letter in the middle of the night to meet at the school, at which point they are accosted and kidnapped. After waking up in a bleached white room, they are informed by Manabu-kun, an eerie childlike mascot character, that they must play a series of games to pay off a 20 million yen sum -- a debt that supposedly belongs to one of them. Although Yuuichi initially doubts the reality of the setup, he is shocked when the other four quickly accede to these demands. His horror is further reinforced by Manabu-kun's mention of an entry fee paid by the debtor equal to the exact amount stolen from the class.                  It is this looming sense of secrecy that creates a unique tension to the elements of Tomodachi Game. The anime masterfully conveys the events from Yuuichi's perspective alone, secluding audiences from the other four in the same way that Yuuichi himself is during the games. All five of them become equally saddled with the divided debt at the start of the contest, despite only one of them being responsible for its existence. Furthermore, the activities are structured in such a way that the amount owed by each character can go up or down based on their actions but is never verified by another participant.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man, Look Back Creator Announces New Feature-Length Manga The first game, based on Kokkuri-san -- the Japanese equivalent of a ouija board -- makes the players communally answer a series of yes-or-no questions by moving a coin around without talking. The board itself, programmed to move in the direction of the minority answer, initially seems to be a largely innocuous hurdle. Still, once the seemingly simple questions come back consistently incorrect, it seems like sabotage may be the only explanation.                 Many viewers have compared the show to death game series like Alice in Borderland or Squid Game. The latter parallel appears particularly apt due to the promise of prize money to settle a massive debt. Additionally, Squid Game's bouts for survival are largely based around childhood pastimes. Tomodachi Game's Kokkuri-san certainly fits the bill for that genre of activity, as does the presence of the unsettling Manabu-kun, who comes from a kid's anime within the world of Tomodachi Game.

Likewise, by making the contest about money rather than death, it places them in a situation where the consequences are more morally gray.

By Hilary Leung Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Azuma faces off against Umezawa, but is he any match for the choujin?                  The following contains spoilers for Choujin X, Chapter 19 by Sui Ishida, Jan Cash and Snir Aharon, available in English from Viz Media and Manga Plus.   The horror elements really shine through in this week's chapter of Choujin X -- qualities that have made Ishida's artwork so iconic. After being rejected from tagging along on the rescue mission, Azuma takes matters into his own hands and sets off alone to save Tokio. Doubts had been floating around in the air regarding whether Azuma's intentions were genuine or not, but those doubts are resolved as his characterization becomes more fleshed out.  Ishida's artwork cannot be praised enough, especially in the fight scene between Azuma and Umezawa. It's striking and dynamic in a way that makes every kick and punch look that much harder. Azuma is a good fighter, but against a formidable opponent like Umezawa, what hope does he really have to win? RELATED: Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll                 The chapter opens with Azuma sitting gloomily in front of his shelf full of awards and trophies. Even though Azuma doesn't have the more obvious traits of a choujin like Tokio who can transform into a vulture-like creature, the chapter drops hints that there may have been changes to Azuma's body as a result of the injection, such as the wheelchair implying that Azuma might be weaker than before.  As a non-choujin, Azuma knows that there's truth to Sato's words; he wouldn't stand a chance against any of the choujin and would only slow the rescue crew down if he accompanied them. However, he remembers what his father told him: \"To shirk justice is cowardice.\" Azuma might be scared, but if he turned away from doing the right thing, not only would it be wrong but he would also be a coward. Back in Chapter 1, Azuma was the first to grab the syringe that contained the serum, and Tokio did the same because he wanted to remain friends with Azuma. Tokio risked his life to save Azuma. Now Azuma wants to do the same for Tokio.  He arrives at an abandoned motel where Umezawa awaits. Without wasting any time, Azuma swings a kick out at Umezawa, but she transforms into paper and slips out of his grasp. She warns him that if he continues on like this, he will die. Because Azuma is already quite good at fighting, he's able to land a few hits on Umezawa, with one of his kicks removing her mask. She uses her second ability called Paper Trip, which allows her to transform everything she touches into paper so that Azuma loses his footing. As soon as she finds an opening, Umezawa strikes, cutting off one of his ears as revenge for kicking her in the face.  RELATED: Which Anime to Watch After Finishing Tokyo Ghoul                 Umezawa is pretty perceptive. Even though Azuma seems adamant that all he wants to do is be a good friend, she accurately (or not) pinpoints that he's doing this to test himself in the hope that fighting a choujin might give him powers. This fight is part noble and part selfish in that regard. But she doesn't really care -- she's more angry that Azuma landed a kick on her, and she shows no mercy in retaliating. She truly gives a whole other meaning to the phrase 'Death by papercut' because by the end of it, Azuma is so severely wounded that it looks like he wouldn't be able to last more than a few more seconds.  Whenever Azuma isn't sure what to do, he remembers a time when his father took him to the railroad with two tracks diverging in two different directions. The tracks on the right lead to Yamato, but when Azuma asked his father where the ones on the left went, his father didn't answer. Instead, he led Azuma down the tracks, walking through the forest until they arrived at a blockade. The tracks on the left led to nowhere. Despite Azuma not knowing what the outcome of his choice in saving Tokio would be and that it would lead to a dead end, he still went to save him. The metaphor extends to Azuma's final moments just before Umezawa launches her final attack, when he remembers the two diverging railroad tracks in his childhood memory. Two paths, two choices. One path leads him to something that he's familiar with -- something safe -- while the other path leads only to a dead end. Just before Umezawa dismembers him, the lever switches, representing something being unlocked. It's possible that Azuma might have been unconsciously hindering himself from reaching his full potential as a choujin.  It will be difficult to wait for the next chapter of Choujin X to see what happened to Azuma. This is probably not the last time readers have seen him, but will they be witnessing the birth of a new choujin?

Choujin X: Has [SPOILER]'s Story Hit a Dead End?  By Hilary Leung Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Azuma faces off against Umezawa, but is he any match for the choujin?                  The following contains spoilers for Choujin X, Chapter 19 by Sui Ishida, Jan Cash and Snir Aharon, available in English from Viz Media and Manga Plus.   The horror elements really shine through in this week's chapter of Choujin X -- qualities that have made Ishida's artwork so iconic. After being rejected from tagging along on the rescue mission, Azuma takes matters into his own hands and sets off alone to save Tokio. Doubts had been floating around in the air regarding whether Azuma's intentions were genuine or not, but those doubts are resolved as his characterization becomes more fleshed out.  Ishida's artwork cannot be praised enough, especially in the fight scene between Azuma and Umezawa. It's striking and dynamic in a way that makes every kick and punch look that much harder. Azuma is a good fighter, but against a formidable opponent like Umezawa, what hope does he really have to win? RELATED: Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll                 The chapter opens with Azuma sitting gloomily in front of his shelf full of awards and trophies. Even though Azuma doesn't have the more obvious traits of a choujin like Tokio who can transform into a vulture-like creature, the chapter drops hints that there may have been changes to Azuma's body as a result of the injection, such as the wheelchair implying that Azuma might be weaker than before.  As a non-choujin, Azuma knows that there's truth to Sato's words; he wouldn't stand a chance against any of the choujin and would only slow the rescue crew down if he accompanied them. However, he remembers what his father told him: \"To shirk justice is cowardice.\" Azuma might be scared, but if he turned away from doing the right thing, not only would it be wrong but he would also be a coward. Back in Chapter 1, Azuma was the first to grab the syringe that contained the serum, and Tokio did the same because he wanted to remain friends with Azuma. Tokio risked his life to save Azuma. Now Azuma wants to do the same for Tokio.  He arrives at an abandoned motel where Umezawa awaits. Without wasting any time, Azuma swings a kick out at Umezawa, but she transforms into paper and slips out of his grasp. She warns him that if he continues on like this, he will die. Because Azuma is already quite good at fighting, he's able to land a few hits on Umezawa, with one of his kicks removing her mask. She uses her second ability called Paper Trip, which allows her to transform everything she touches into paper so that Azuma loses his footing. As soon as she finds an opening, Umezawa strikes, cutting off one of his ears as revenge for kicking her in the face.  RELATED: Which Anime to Watch After Finishing Tokyo Ghoul                 Umezawa is pretty perceptive. Even though Azuma seems adamant that all he wants to do is be a good friend, she accurately (or not) pinpoints that he's doing this to test himself in the hope that fighting a choujin might give him powers. This fight is part noble and part selfish in that regard. But she doesn't really care -- she's more angry that Azuma landed a kick on her, and she shows no mercy in retaliating. She truly gives a whole other meaning to the phrase 'Death by papercut' because by the end of it, Azuma is so severely wounded that it looks like he wouldn't be able to last more than a few more seconds.  Whenever Azuma isn't sure what to do, he remembers a time when his father took him to the railroad with two tracks diverging in two different directions. The tracks on the right lead to Yamato, but when Azuma asked his father where the ones on the left went, his father didn't answer. Instead, he led Azuma down the tracks, walking through the forest until they arrived at a blockade. The tracks on the left led to nowhere. Despite Azuma not knowing what the outcome of his choice in saving Tokio would be and that it would lead to a dead end, he still went to save him. The metaphor extends to Azuma's final moments just before Umezawa launches her final attack, when he remembers the two diverging railroad tracks in his childhood memory. Two paths, two choices. One path leads him to something that he's familiar with -- something safe -- while the other path leads only to a dead end. Just before Umezawa dismembers him, the lever switches, representing something being unlocked. It's possible that Azuma might have been unconsciously hindering himself from reaching his full potential as a choujin.  It will be difficult to wait for the next chapter of Choujin X to see what happened to Azuma. This is probably not the last time readers have seen him, but will they be witnessing the birth of a new choujin?

Unfortunately, some characters won't ever get a rematch.                  Akira Toriyama\u2019s Dragon Ball has achieved legendary status that\u2019s kept it at the forefront of the anime industry for nearly four decades. Dragon Ball chronicles the heroic adventures of Goku and his courageous friends who tirelessly fight to protect the planet from danger. There\u2019s a huge cast, incredible energy techniques, and powerful transformations that keep Dragon Ball fresh, but the series always knows when to expand its boundaries and head into new territory.  RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Fights That Dragged On Too Long The thrilling battles that punctuate Dragon Ball\u2019s climaxes are one of the most celebrated aspects of the series. Characters occasionally get multiple opportunities to prove themselves and work out their aggression, but the opposite is also true. There are some Dragon Ball rematches that would function as major events, but are likely lost causes at this point.  10          Another Fight Between Saiyan Siblings, Goku And Raditz, Isn\u2019t Happening                The bulk of Dragon Ball\u2019s villains have found ways to weasel back into the picture and get another chance at success. However, some of Dragon Ball\u2019s most interesting foes are the fleeting ones that appear at the start of the series. Dragon Ball Z\u2019s first real fight pushes Goku and Piccolo to work together as they take on invading alien, Raditz. Raditz sufficiently showcases Saiyan strength, but the battle is especially emotional since the enemy is Goku\u2019s estranged brother. There\u2019s so much potential in the idea of a rematch between these Saiyan siblings, but this window has likely closed.  9          Bardock Won\u2019t Get A Second Chance To Show His Winning Strategy Over Gas                There are certain rematches between Dragon Ball juggernauts that audiences have been waiting to see for hundreds of episodes, but there are also feuds that are considerably more recent. Gas is Dragon Ball Super\u2019s latest antagonist and the dangerous member of the Heeter Force actually has a curious history with Bardock, Goku\u2019s father. Goku currently struggles to conquer Gas\u2019 power, but it\u2019s something that Bardock was somehow able to accomplish. Bardock\u2019s deceased status makes it highly unlikely that he\u2019ll show up to take out Gas and save the day for Goku.  8          Vegeta And Nappa\u2019s Lengthy History Remains In The Past                Vegeta first appears in Dragon Ball Z as a serious threat to Earth\u2019s future, and it doesn\u2019t take long for a fiery rivalry to form between him and Goku. Vegeta and Goku grow into an iconic Saiyan team, but for years Vegeta engaged in destruction with his partner, Nappa. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Short Fights That Needed To Be Longer Nappa devastates Earth\u2019s weaker heroes, but he\u2019s no match for Goku, which causes Vegeta to cut his losses with the dead weight. Nappa, like Raditz, has mostly remained deceased. An extremely brief reunion between Vegeta and Nappa occurs during Dragon Ball GT\u2019s jailbreak from hell, but it\u2019s unlikely a more substantial rematch ever occurs.  7          An Older Gotenks And Lean Buu Deserve To Duel                Self-improvement isn\u2019t always enough in Dragon Ball, which is where the collaborative process of fusion comes into play. Fusion allows two individuals to combine their strength and abilities into one powerful package. A lot of stock is put on fused fighter, Gotenks, and how he might be strong enough to defeat Buu in his Super Saiyan 3 state. Gotenks isn\u2019t successful, but a helpful version of Buu joins the heroes after the fact. Dragon Ball Super hasn\u2019t done much with Buu, but he briefly gets in shape during his preparation for the Tournament of Power. A new clash of powers between these two would have been a delight.  6          Cabba And Vegeta\u2019s Moment For Collaboration Has Passed                The appearance of a new Saiyan is always reason for celebration in Dragon Ball, but Super goes above and beyond in this regard. Universe 6 and 7 are frequently pitted against each other in competition, which allows Goku and the rest of the universe\u2019s Saiyans to get close with Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale. Cabba exhibits a lot of reverence towards Vegeta\u2019s regal status and is just as interested in training under him as he is in sparring against him. Dragon Ball Super sets up some one-on-one time between these two, but it\u2019s been so long without this promise getting fulfilled that the moment has likely passed.  5          Goku And Pikkon Are The Pride Of The North Quadrant\u2019s Fallen Fighters                A debate rages on between Dragon Ball purists and those who want more incorporation from the anime\u2019s filler material. Pikkon is one of the more popular anime-only characters. The deceased fighter first crosses paths with Goku in the Other World Tournament, where he proves himself as the Super Saiyan\u2019s equal. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 7 Classic Fights That Would Have Been Better With Ki Impressively, Pikkon also plays an important role in the film Fusion Reborn and is a common participant in video games. Many hoped that recruitment for the Tournament of Power would result in an invitation extended out to Pikkon, but Super\u2019s decision to ignore the individual is probably a confirmation that a rematch isn\u2019t happening.  4          Piccolo Won\u2019t Get To Show His Improvement In Another Battle Against Universe 6\u2019s Frost                Piccolo experiences a significant power upgrade on Planet Namek when he fuses with Nail and proves himself against Frieza\u2019s second form. A full-on rematch between Piccolo and Frieza would be incredible after how much they\u2019ve grown, but it\u2019s something that might actually happen with Frieza\u2019s reintegration into the story. Alternatively, Universe 6\u2019s Frieza counterpart, Frost, faces against Piccolo during Universe 7\u2019s tournament against Champa\u2019s best fighters. Frost is fascinating when his intentions are a mystery, but he recedes into the background after he\u2019s exposed as a lesser version of Frieza.  3          A Super Saiyan 4 Showdown Against Anyone Is Extremely Unlikely                Contrary to popular opinion, Dragon Ball GT isn\u2019t a dumpster fire anime sequel. Dragon Ball GT takes some time to find its footing, but it explores some genuinely creative ideas, which unfortunately have largely been undone through the events of Dragon Ball Super. One of Dragon Ball GT\u2019s longest lasting legacies is its unique Super Saiyan 4 transformation. Dragon Ball Super opts for Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue instead of the GT counterpart, which means that it\u2019s unlikely that there will be a legitimate rematch between any Super Saiyan 4 with anyone (other than in video games and the promotional series, Super Dragon Ball Heroes).  2          Audiences Have Waited Decades For A Gohan And Cell Reunion                Goku usually steals the spotlight when it comes to the elimination of Dragon Ball\u2019s biggest opponents, which is exactly why Gohan\u2019s Super Saiyan 2 debut and subsequent destruction of Cell remains a high point for the series. Gohan has only grown more powerful since his fight against Cell, and it\u2019d make sense if the same was also true for his opponent. There are rumors that Cell makes his grand return in the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, which is the perfect opportunity for a rematch against a grown-up Gohan. This remains wishful thinking and Dragon Ball fans have gotten used to the idea that Cell\u2019s a permanent casualty.  1          Goku And Jiren\u2019s Clash Is The Tournament Of Power\u2019s Apex                Villains of unprecedented power show up in Dragon Ball Super, but the multiversal battle royale competition, the Tournament of Power, becomes the anime\u2019s ultimate test. The strongest warriors from across the multiverse compete in the face of the universes\u2019 potential erasure. Goku and Universe 7 hold their own, but Universe 11\u2019s Jiren quickly proves himself to be Goku\u2019s toughest competition. Jiren\u2019s perseverance and strength pushes Goku to dip into Ultra Instinct power for the first time, which is a milestone for the franchise. Jiren is still alive and he and Goku aren\u2019t on poor terms, but it seems as if Dragon Ball considers Jiren to be in its past.

Here are some of the best slice of life titles with darker themes.                  The following article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm.   Slice of life as a genre is generally accepted as a pretty lighthearted display of everyday life with no major conflicts. It\u2019s often grounded within a strong comedic premise, characterized by bright colors and cheerful characters. Series like Nichijou and Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku are great examples of a traditional take on this genre.  In recent years, anime studios have begun experimenting with incorporating darker themes into what had previously been established as a bright genre. This is in line with the growing maturity of audiences as well as the growing diversity of anime. Combining slice of life with dark themes adds extra depth to a series, without making it so heavy that it could be hard to watch. Here are some of the best examples of slice of life anime that have dark undertones. RELATED: Flying Witch Shares a Fascinating Concept With Harry Potter - and It's Not Magic          Wonder Egg Priority Looks Into the Inner Demons of Humanity                 As one of the most recent adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority follows the story of Ai Ooto after the suicide of her best friend, Koito Nagase. Following the instructions of a mysterious entity, Ai purchases a Wonder Egg, which enables her to fight off people\u2019s trauma, regrets and fears as fantasized enemies in a dream realm. With each person she successfully saves from their demons, she grows one step closer to saving her best friend. Despite the deceptively bright colors and youthful protagonists, Wonder Egg Priority explores the depths of humanity\u2019s inner demons through their dream realms. A sexually abused girl facing off against the monsterized teacher that abused her. A school gymnast standing up against a gym teacher that pressurised her. It\u2019s made even more poignant and bittersweet when it\u2019s revealed that all the victims are already dead.  RELATED: The Most Overlooked Iyashikei Anime Series - and Where to Watch Them          Girls\u2019 Last Tour Explores a Post-Apocalyptic World                 Girls\u2019 Last Tour is set amid the rubble of a once-thriving city torn apart by war. In this post-apocalyptic setting, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the only survivors as they ride through the desolation on their motorbike, scavenging for food and contemplating life before the war. This entire anime is lighthearted and cutesy, detailing their everyday adventures and discoveries. However, by framing their story from a third-person perspective, it offers a unique insight into the reality of the situation beyond what the girls themselves might perceive.  RELATED: Aharen-san Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters          Your Lie in April Treasures the Fragility of Life                 Initially presented as a typical slice of life school anime, Your Lie in April quickly takes a dive into the deep end. It is revealed that prodigious pianist Kousei Arima can no longer hear the sound of the piano after his mother\u2019s death. Amid themes of childhood trauma, Kousei finally regains color in his life when he meets the upbeat violinist Kaori Miyazono, who hides a secret of her own beneath her cheerful facade. Interspersed between peaceful scenes of everyday school life are flashbacks to childhood trauma and the realities of dealing with a terminal illness. This duality in dynamics is executed beautifully. Despite the undercurrent of darker themes, the overall tone of this series remains hopeful, playing to the strengths of the slice of life genre.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Orange Tackles Heavy Themes of Mental Health                 At its core, Orange tells a story of regret. One day, 16-year-old Naho Takamiya receives a strange letter from herself 10 years in the future, detailing the regrets her future self wished to fix. Among those is one related to the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, who is no longer alive in the future. Given the opportunity to fix past mistakes, Naho strives to save Kakeru before history repeats itself. The themes of Orange are made a lot more significant because its setting is grounded in reality. Mental health leading to suicide is often very subtle and hard to notice, and this story accurately portrays that. It doesn\u2019t overdramatize the issue but invites the audience to look out for signs and clues along with the protagonists.  RELATED: 2022 Is Proving Anime Fans Can Always Hope for Their Favorite Series' Return          Usagi Drop Breaks the Stigma of Being a Single Parent                 Anime can explore a lot of dark themes, but the topic of being a single parent is rarely touched upon. Usagi Drop follows 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi Kawachi as he tries to raise Rin, his grandfather\u2019s illegitimate daughter with no child-rearing experience whatsoever. Daikichi and Rin have a very unique father-daughter relationship. Forced together by circumstance, both are trying to adjust to this new life and relationship dynamic. It\u2019s endearing to see how they learn and grow together through everyday annoyances and troubles.  Slice of life anime doesn\u2019t just have to be simple stories of everyday fun. When used in conjunction with darker themes, they offer a much more complex process of storytelling which sets these series apart from others.

Here are some of the best slice of life titles with darker themes.                  The following article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm.   Slice of life as a genre is generally accepted as a pretty lighthearted display of everyday life with no major conflicts. It\u2019s often grounded within a strong comedic premise, characterized by bright colors and cheerful characters. Series like Nichijou and Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku are great examples of a traditional take on this genre.  In recent years, anime studios have begun experimenting with incorporating darker themes into what had previously been established as a bright genre. This is in line with the growing maturity of audiences as well as the growing diversity of anime. Combining slice of life with dark themes adds extra depth to a series, without making it so heavy that it could be hard to watch. Here are some of the best examples of slice of life anime that have dark undertones. RELATED: Flying Witch Shares a Fascinating Concept With Harry Potter - and It's Not Magic          Wonder Egg Priority Looks Into the Inner Demons of Humanity                 As one of the most recent adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority follows the story of Ai Ooto after the suicide of her best friend, Koito Nagase. Following the instructions of a mysterious entity, Ai purchases a Wonder Egg, which enables her to fight off people\u2019s trauma, regrets and fears as fantasized enemies in a dream realm. With each person she successfully saves from their demons, she grows one step closer to saving her best friend. Despite the deceptively bright colors and youthful protagonists, Wonder Egg Priority explores the depths of humanity\u2019s inner demons through their dream realms. A sexually abused girl facing off against the monsterized teacher that abused her. A school gymnast standing up against a gym teacher that pressurised her. It\u2019s made even more poignant and bittersweet when it\u2019s revealed that all the victims are already dead.  RELATED: The Most Overlooked Iyashikei Anime Series - and Where to Watch Them          Girls\u2019 Last Tour Explores a Post-Apocalyptic World                 Girls\u2019 Last Tour is set amid the rubble of a once-thriving city torn apart by war. In this post-apocalyptic setting, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the only survivors as they ride through the desolation on their motorbike, scavenging for food and contemplating life before the war. This entire anime is lighthearted and cutesy, detailing their everyday adventures and discoveries. However, by framing their story from a third-person perspective, it offers a unique insight into the reality of the situation beyond what the girls themselves might perceive.  RELATED: Aharen-san Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters          Your Lie in April Treasures the Fragility of Life                 Initially presented as a typical slice of life school anime, Your Lie in April quickly takes a dive into the deep end. It is revealed that prodigious pianist Kousei Arima can no longer hear the sound of the piano after his mother\u2019s death. Amid themes of childhood trauma, Kousei finally regains color in his life when he meets the upbeat violinist Kaori Miyazono, who hides a secret of her own beneath her cheerful facade. Interspersed between peaceful scenes of everyday school life are flashbacks to childhood trauma and the realities of dealing with a terminal illness. This duality in dynamics is executed beautifully. Despite the undercurrent of darker themes, the overall tone of this series remains hopeful, playing to the strengths of the slice of life genre.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Orange Tackles Heavy Themes of Mental Health                 At its core, Orange tells a story of regret. One day, 16-year-old Naho Takamiya receives a strange letter from herself 10 years in the future, detailing the regrets her future self wished to fix. Among those is one related to the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, who is no longer alive in the future. Given the opportunity to fix past mistakes, Naho strives to save Kakeru before history repeats itself. The themes of Orange are made a lot more significant because its setting is grounded in reality. Mental health leading to suicide is often very subtle and hard to notice, and this story accurately portrays that. It doesn\u2019t overdramatize the issue but invites the audience to look out for signs and clues along with the protagonists.  RELATED: 2022 Is Proving Anime Fans Can Always Hope for Their Favorite Series' Return          Usagi Drop Breaks the Stigma of Being a Single Parent                 Anime can explore a lot of dark themes, but the topic of being a single parent is rarely touched upon. Usagi Drop follows 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi Kawachi as he tries to raise Rin, his grandfather\u2019s illegitimate daughter with no child-rearing experience whatsoever. Daikichi and Rin have a very unique father-daughter relationship. Forced together by circumstance, both are trying to adjust to this new life and relationship dynamic. It\u2019s endearing to see how they learn and grow together through everyday annoyances and troubles.  Slice of life anime doesn\u2019t just have to be simple stories of everyday fun. When used in conjunction with darker themes, they offer a much more complex process of storytelling which sets these series apart from others.

January's Marauders: Annual 2021 #1 by Steve Orlando and Creees Lee followed Captain Kate Pryde and Bishop as they assembled a new team with an altruistic mission to help at-risk mutants around the world. But before they were even finished recruiting, Kate discovered an ancient mysterium puzzle box containing a map and a message with potentially colossal implications about both the past and the future of mutant-kind. Now, Orlando is teaming up with artist Eleonora Carlini, colorist Matt Milla and letterer Ariana Maher to present Marauders #1, an exciting first issue full of surprises.  Marauders #1 begins when Kate Pryde follows the map from the puzzle box to a forgotten corner of Krakoa, where she comes face to face with the infamous Cassandra Nova. Kate still holds Professor Xavier's deranged twin sister responsible for the deaths of countless mutants in the attack on Genosha, but she is a reformist at heart, and Cassandra assures her that she \"couldn't hurt a mutant fly.\" So Nova becomes the final member of the Marauders and points them in the direction of hordes of mutants in need of assistance in outer space. Related: Marvel's X-Men: Red #1 Comic Review                 Orlando does a great job introducing readers to the new team of heroes without getting bogged down in exposition. By introducing the team to Cassandra Nova, Orlando is able to quickly introduce readers to each member of the team to catch readers up naturally. The tension between the Marauders and their powerful new teammate adds to the overall sense of danger and uncertainty that surrounds the team as they embark on a mission to confront the Shi'Ar. By maintaining such a fast pace, Orlando gives the reader a sense of the disorienting flurry of activity that Kate Pryde and her compatriots are struggling to respond to.  Carlini's art complements Orlando's writing perfectly. Her page designs bring the pain and chaos of the action to light in an entertaining, but empathetic way. When Kate and Bishop are trying to help a distraught mutant, Carlini perfectly balances the serious emotional implications of the situation with a thrilling action sequence. The scene that introduces Cassandra Nova is particularly compelling. Carlini reveals the controversial character with a large spread that makes her appear as monstrous as her reputation would suggest. But Carlini's best work in Marauders #1 can be found in her stunning depictions of outer space. She does an excellent job capturing the vast beauty of the landscape to underscore the epic science fiction side of this first issue.  Related: Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review                Marauders #1 ends with the titular heroes in a remarkably precarious position and sets the stage for a fast-paced series. Whether they are exploring the wilds of Krakoa or rocketing into the far reaches of space, the Marauders are intriguing and easy to root for.

Home Comics Comic Features Batman Confirms Wonder Woman Has No Weaknesses    Batman Confirms Wonder Woman Has No Weaknesses  By Amer Sawan Published 2 days ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   After Wonder Woman was turned into a vampire, Batman revealed that she had no weakness beyond her friends and that ship has sailed.                  WARNING: The following article contains spoilers from DC vs. Vampires #5, on sale now.   Every hero has some form of weakness, a vulnerability that can be exploited by their enemies or in worst case scenarios, their friends. DC vs. Vampires #5 (by James Tynion IV, Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, Simone di Meo, Tom Napolitano) rejected this premise for Wonder Woman. When it was revealed that she had been turned, Green Arrow asked Batman what weaknesses she had that they could exploit. His response: Her friends.  This actually reaffirms something Batman once revealed about Wonder Woman during the New 52 era; Wonder Woman has no physical weakness to exploit. Any attempt to actually defeat her will require taking advantage of her natural compassion for those she cares about. In her new undead state of existence however, that is no longer the case. RELATED: The Suicide Squad\u2019s Breakout Star Is Now a Bloodthirsty Vampire                 In the since retconned continuity, Wonder Woman and Superman were just beginning to develop a romantic relationship. This worried Batman, who feared what could happen if Wonder Woman went rogue. Batman had a vault containing methods to defeat each member of the Justice League except for Wonder Woman. While Superman had kryptonite as a deterrent, Wonder Woman had no such weaknesses.  This is echoed in Batman's present day explanation about her weaknesses. The only way to defeat Wonder Woman is on an equal playing field, the only trick that could be used against her is pulling on her heartstrings and making her hesitate to hurt the ones she loves. The chance to use that has long since passed. In her new vampiric form Wonder Woman is more than prepared to murder her friends, forsaking their previous bonds in favor of the freedom that comes with being a vampire. RELATED: DC vs Vampires Proves How Lethal a Justice League Civil War Would Get                 This left Superman as their only real option. So it's a horrifying turn of events that he was turned in that very same issue. This effectively means that Diana has no physical equal on Earth anymore and with her moral compass tossed aside after being turned there is nothing she isn't capable of.  However, while she is happy about being a vampire, it might have actually made her weaker instead of stronger. The usual restraints she places upon herself are gone, but in their place are all the weaknesses vampires normally have such as an aversion to sunlight and holy water. Ironically, despite claiming to be better off, Diana is now physically weaker than she has ever been, with a whole portion of the day and night cycle denied to her as a consequence. Still, this is cold comfort when one considers the greater plans of the vampires. Adding to this is Diana's own natural powers and how dangerous she is now that her appreciation for human life has entirely vanished. Batman was right in the end, Wonder Woman's greatest strength, her compassion, was also her biggest weakness. Without it only a handful of people in the DC Universe are capable of defeating her, and they're either turned or dead in this alternate world.

WARNING: The following article contains spoilers from DC vs. Vampires #5, on sale now.   Every hero has some form of weakness, a vulnerability that can be exploited by their enemies or in worst case scenarios, their friends. DC vs. Vampires #5 (by James Tynion IV, Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, Simone di Meo, Tom Napolitano) rejected this premise for Wonder Woman. When it was revealed that she had been turned, Green Arrow asked Batman what weaknesses she had that they could exploit. His response: Her friends.  This actually reaffirms something Batman once revealed about Wonder Woman during the New 52 era; Wonder Woman has no physical weakness to exploit. Any attempt to actually defeat her will require taking advantage of her natural compassion for those she cares about. In her new undead state of existence however, that is no longer the case. RELATED: The Suicide Squad\u2019s Breakout Star Is Now a Bloodthirsty Vampire                 In the since retconned continuity, Wonder Woman and Superman were just beginning to develop a romantic relationship. This worried Batman, who feared what could happen if Wonder Woman went rogue. Batman had a vault containing methods to defeat each member of the Justice League except for Wonder Woman. While Superman had kryptonite as a deterrent, Wonder Woman had no such weaknesses.  This is echoed in Batman's present day explanation about her weaknesses. The only way to defeat Wonder Woman is on an equal playing field, the only trick that could be used against her is pulling on her heartstrings and making her hesitate to hurt the ones she loves. The chance to use that has long since passed. In her new vampiric form Wonder Woman is more than prepared to murder her friends, forsaking their previous bonds in favor of the freedom that comes with being a vampire. RELATED: DC vs Vampires Proves How Lethal a Justice League Civil War Would Get                 This left Superman as their only real option. So it's a horrifying turn of events that he was turned in that very same issue. This effectively means that Diana has no physical equal on Earth anymore and with her moral compass tossed aside after being turned there is nothing she isn't capable of.  However, while she is happy about being a vampire, it might have actually made her weaker instead of stronger. The usual restraints she places upon herself are gone, but in their place are all the weaknesses vampires normally have such as an aversion to sunlight and holy water. Ironically, despite claiming to be better off, Diana is now physically weaker than she has ever been, with a whole portion of the day and night cycle denied to her as a consequence. Still, this is cold comfort when one considers the greater plans of the vampires. Adding to this is Diana's own natural powers and how dangerous she is now that her appreciation for human life has entirely vanished. Batman was right in the end, Wonder Woman's greatest strength, her compassion, was also her biggest weakness. Without it only a handful of people in the DC Universe are capable of defeating her, and they're either turned or dead in this alternate world.
