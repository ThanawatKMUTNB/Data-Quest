for you\r even if you like dumb schlock this is not for you\r the animation in the first half is so jarring and only get passable in the second half\r even the connection to to aru is flimsy at best, last order barely shows up and barely does anything of consequence, accelerator is weirdly passive even for being his nerfed version\r this season should've been called \"a certain magical necromancer\"\r almost everything as based around esther and her drama which to be fair is quite interesting its just too little too late and so much time is wasted on showing accelerator\r cackling

specifically about the ending and contains spoilers. \r The final episode introduced an interesting idea of what happens to a person when completely isolated with nothing of substance or fulfilment is left for them in life (at least from my understanding). \r Starting out, Juri is vigilant (shot of her doing stretches and later exercising) and retains most of her mental stability by reminding her self of family. Eventually boredom and frustration kick in (likely from isolation/nothing to do). To break out she resorts to escapism through excessive drinking and consumption of entertainment, which eventually loses its charm.  \r Next she has a breakdown followed by repeated attempts to suppress the reality of her situation (\"no more depresressing thoughts\"). Finally she hits a point where she's on the verge of giving up on life and becoming a handler (bascially choosing death).  \r At this point her situtation really seems hopeless, what exactly would Juri do to actually salavge her situation? I was really hoping to see some insightful take on this.  \r But unfortunately the show cops out by switching the narritive to the MC meeting the immortal lady who can end the stasis and free her. Effectively abandoning the idea on what someone might do if completely isolated. I suppose one could argue that the solution is to just keep going and hope you have the luck to bump into someone to help you before you give up? At least from what I see there's importance to being in and appreciating the relationships you have close to you and not just letting them pass you by. \r To add some basic alternative endings:\r - Happy ending: she learns to control statis and effectively control time. Which I don't think is too unreasonable. And would signal maybe that life is what you make of what you got?\r - Sad ending: she dies at the mercy of isolation, signalling that life is meaningless without someone to share it with? \r Final comment: The fact that some fairly simple endings were avoided in a matter I found pretty interesting in favour of a cop out was a pretty big let down.
