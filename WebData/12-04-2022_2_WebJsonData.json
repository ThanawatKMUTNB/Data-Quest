The following contains spoilers for the first cour of Requiem of the Rose King, now streaming on Funimation.The first cour of Requiem of the Rose King ended on a dismal note. Having his heart broken multiple times by those he loved the most, Richard stabbed Henry until all of the words, cursing him as a demon, finally stopped. The episode ends with Richard embracing his new and darker beginnings after leaving the old Richard, who yearned to be loved, for dead in the forest. It's a tragic ending, and it only speaks to even darker beginnings as the second cour of the anime begins.  In the next part of Requiem of the Rose King, viewers are about to see a different side of Richard. While his goal has always been to protect the House of York and for York to be the ones in power, he is starting to take every measure possible to ensure that this is the case -- even if that means going against his brothers. New characters will be introduced and more conspiracies will be hatched behind the scenes to gain control of the throne. Here's what viewers should know going in. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King's Biggest Identity Reveals Land [SPOILER] in Hell          Time-Skip in Requiem of the Rose King                 A few years have passed since the events of the first cour, and several things have come to pass. The first is that Richard and Anne have since married. Once upon a time, the two of them marrying would have been a happy occasion since the two genuinely seemed to like each other. However, with Richard misunderstanding Anne's words and Anne witnessing Richard kill Edward and hearing how he did the same to her father, their marriage is a loveless one. Anne has also given birth to Edward's child, who adores Richard. Meanwhile, Edward and Elizabeth's marriage has grown stale. Once infatuated with the Woodville widow, Edward now seeks comfort in other women's arms. Elizabeth isn't too bothered by it though; her plan to seize control of the throne to avenge her husband's death has already been set into motion with the birth of her two sons. All she needs to do is bide her time.          A Witch and Assassin Get Introduced                 Aside from the main cast of characters such as Richard, his brothers and Anne, the second cour will introduce some new characters, one of whom is a witch named Jane Shore who is revealed to be a lascivious and seductive woman, capable of turning men weak with her potions. A shockingly familiar face also makes his appearance in the form of a merciless assassin named James Tyrell. He has no memories of his past life and one of his eyes is slashed. When he's not carrying out his assassinations, Tyrell spends his time shepherding, which sounds eerily familiar to another man viewers have met before.  RELATED: Yashahime Season 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions          The Power Struggle for the Throne                 The king's crown is never free of blood. Richard's father was slain. Warwick was killed after he became regent. A war among brothers almost broke out after George betrayed Edward. Henry's son was killed by Richard. After all the bloody conflicts, the crown now rests on Edward's head. Even though Edward and George had reconciled and it looked like they were genuinely back to being loyal brothers, the latter still seeks the crown for himself. After the time skip, George has been drowning himself in alcohol, making him reckless.  Buckingham had always seen a king's quality within Richard, even though he was insistent that he only sought to serve the House of York and its interests. However, Buckingham knew that deep down, Richard desired the crown for himself. But before Richard can sit on the throne, he'll need to clear everyone in his way, which includes his brothers, their heirs and a new rival: the Duke of Richmond.           The Darker Undertones of the Story                 Richard's internal struggle has always been the point of conflict within the story. Having spent his life being derided for his body and being rejected, it didn't look like he would ever be accepted by anyone he loved, especially after losing Henry. However, he does find someone who will love and accept him for who he is -- his other half -- but the beginning of their relationship is fraught with its own issues and tensions. Richard's path to kingship will not be an easy one. The higher he climbs, the more despair he seems to sink under.  Requiem of the Rose King isn't a lighthearted series. It deals with sex and violence that is closely intertwined with the politics of the story. The anime adaptation hasn't been as explicit in these particular scenes and has only been heavily implied. The second cour will only become darker and more serious from here on out, although whether the anime adaptation will be faithful to the manga in that regard remains to be seen.

The following contains spoilers for the first cour of Requiem of the Rose King, now streaming on Funimation.The first cour of Requiem of the Rose King ended on a dismal note. Having his heart broken multiple times by those he loved the most, Richard stabbed Henry until all of the words, cursing him as a demon, finally stopped. The episode ends with Richard embracing his new and darker beginnings after leaving the old Richard, who yearned to be loved, for dead in the forest. It's a tragic ending, and it only speaks to even darker beginnings as the second cour of the anime begins.  In the next part of Requiem of the Rose King, viewers are about to see a different side of Richard. While his goal has always been to protect the House of York and for York to be the ones in power, he is starting to take every measure possible to ensure that this is the case -- even if that means going against his brothers. New characters will be introduced and more conspiracies will be hatched behind the scenes to gain control of the throne. Here's what viewers should know going in. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King's Biggest Identity Reveals Land [SPOILER] in Hell          Time-Skip in Requiem of the Rose King                 A few years have passed since the events of the first cour, and several things have come to pass. The first is that Richard and Anne have since married. Once upon a time, the two of them marrying would have been a happy occasion since the two genuinely seemed to like each other. However, with Richard misunderstanding Anne's words and Anne witnessing Richard kill Edward and hearing how he did the same to her father, their marriage is a loveless one. Anne has also given birth to Edward's child, who adores Richard. Meanwhile, Edward and Elizabeth's marriage has grown stale. Once infatuated with the Woodville widow, Edward now seeks comfort in other women's arms. Elizabeth isn't too bothered by it though; her plan to seize control of the throne to avenge her husband's death has already been set into motion with the birth of her two sons. All she needs to do is bide her time.          A Witch and Assassin Get Introduced                 Aside from the main cast of characters such as Richard, his brothers and Anne, the second cour will introduce some new characters, one of whom is a witch named Jane Shore who is revealed to be a lascivious and seductive woman, capable of turning men weak with her potions. A shockingly familiar face also makes his appearance in the form of a merciless assassin named James Tyrell. He has no memories of his past life and one of his eyes is slashed. When he's not carrying out his assassinations, Tyrell spends his time shepherding, which sounds eerily familiar to another man viewers have met before.  RELATED: Yashahime Season 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions          The Power Struggle for the Throne                 The king's crown is never free of blood. Richard's father was slain. Warwick was killed after he became regent. A war among brothers almost broke out after George betrayed Edward. Henry's son was killed by Richard. After all the bloody conflicts, the crown now rests on Edward's head. Even though Edward and George had reconciled and it looked like they were genuinely back to being loyal brothers, the latter still seeks the crown for himself. After the time skip, George has been drowning himself in alcohol, making him reckless.  Buckingham had always seen a king's quality within Richard, even though he was insistent that he only sought to serve the House of York and its interests. However, Buckingham knew that deep down, Richard desired the crown for himself. But before Richard can sit on the throne, he'll need to clear everyone in his way, which includes his brothers, their heirs and a new rival: the Duke of Richmond.           The Darker Undertones of the Story                 Richard's internal struggle has always been the point of conflict within the story. Having spent his life being derided for his body and being rejected, it didn't look like he would ever be accepted by anyone he loved, especially after losing Henry. However, he does find someone who will love and accept him for who he is -- his other half -- but the beginning of their relationship is fraught with its own issues and tensions. Richard's path to kingship will not be an easy one. The higher he climbs, the more despair he seems to sink under.  Requiem of the Rose King isn't a lighthearted series. It deals with sex and violence that is closely intertwined with the politics of the story. The anime adaptation hasn't been as explicit in these particular scenes and has only been heavily implied. The second cour will only become darker and more serious from here on out, although whether the anime adaptation will be faithful to the manga in that regard remains to be seen.

Home Comics Comic News The New Batman's Personal Joker Shows How Dangerous - and Different - He Is    The New Batman's Personal Joker Shows How Dangerous - and Different - He Is  By Jeremy Blum Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Jace Fox encounters a new masked enemy in I Am Batman #8, and this villain boasts all of the sadism of the Joker with a deadly physicality.                  Jace Fox bumps into an enemy who appears to be his personal Joker in the latest issue of I Am Batman, and while this villain may boast the same sadistic tendency towards violence as Gotham's Clown Prince of Crime, he also has a dangerous strength to him -- not to mention proficiency with an unusual weapon.  A preview of I Am Batman #8 provided by DC shows Batman confronting his red masked foe in a gallery full of art depicting bodily mutilation. The villain -- whose name appears to be \"Manray,\" judging from the previous issue -- taunts Jace with the same language that the Joker uses against Bruce Wayne and argues that both of them are fighting for the same cause. When Jace ignores Manray's words and throws a punch, the serial killer brandishes what looks like a spiked steaming iron on a chain, slashing Jace's face and knocking him to the ground.

Issue #7 revealed that Rubel was far from a saint, and secretly engaged in sex trafficking. Manray, who seems to fancy himself an avenging vigilante in the same vein as the Dark Knight, may have used Rubel's sins as an excuse to kill him if his passionate speech to Jace is any indication. Thus far, I Am Batman's Jace Fox has mainly tackled street-level crime since moving to New York City with his mother and sisters in issue #6. Manray marks the first time the crimefighter has tackled a masked villain outside of last year's \"Fear State\" event in Gotham City, which saw Jace going up against agents of the peacekeeping company known as the Magistrate.  RELATED: DC Gives Batman an All-New Logo I Am Batman writer John Ridley previously said that moving Jace and his family to New York City gave him the chance to develop the DC's newest Dark Knight outside of the shadow of the Bat-Family: \"We're taking Jace and we're moving him to a real space. We're setting a new and very specific tone for Jace in New York [to] have conversations about policing -- not just sociopolitical conversations, but, okay, a mask shows up in New York. What do we do? It's Batman, it's the DC Universe, but it's a little more real. Expect his own rogues, expect his own partners, expect his own dilemmas. Who is his Joker going to be?\"  I Am Batman #8 comes from Ridley, Christian Duce, Rex Lokus and ALW's Troy Peteri, with cover art by Lokus and Stephen Segovia and variant cover art by Olivier Coipel, Alex Sinclair and Mateus Manhanni. The issue goes on sale on April 12 from DC.

Jace Fox bumps into an enemy who appears to be his personal Joker in the latest issue of I Am Batman, and while this villain may boast the same sadistic tendency towards violence as Gotham's Clown Prince of Crime, he also has a dangerous strength to him -- not to mention proficiency with an unusual weapon.  A preview of I Am Batman #8 provided by DC shows Batman confronting his red masked foe in a gallery full of art depicting bodily mutilation. The villain -- whose name appears to be \"Manray,\" judging from the previous issue -- taunts Jace with the same language that the Joker uses against Bruce Wayne and argues that both of them are fighting for the same cause. When Jace ignores Manray's words and throws a punch, the serial killer brandishes what looks like a spiked steaming iron on a chain, slashing Jace's face and knocking him to the ground.

Issue #7 revealed that Rubel was far from a saint, and secretly engaged in sex trafficking. Manray, who seems to fancy himself an avenging vigilante in the same vein as the Dark Knight, may have used Rubel's sins as an excuse to kill him if his passionate speech to Jace is any indication. Thus far, I Am Batman's Jace Fox has mainly tackled street-level crime since moving to New York City with his mother and sisters in issue #6. Manray marks the first time the crimefighter has tackled a masked villain outside of last year's \"Fear State\" event in Gotham City, which saw Jace going up against agents of the peacekeeping company known as the Magistrate.  RELATED: DC Gives Batman an All-New Logo I Am Batman writer John Ridley previously said that moving Jace and his family to New York City gave him the chance to develop the DC's newest Dark Knight outside of the shadow of the Bat-Family: \"We're taking Jace and we're moving him to a real space. We're setting a new and very specific tone for Jace in New York [to] have conversations about policing -- not just sociopolitical conversations, but, okay, a mask shows up in New York. What do we do? It's Batman, it's the DC Universe, but it's a little more real. Expect his own rogues, expect his own partners, expect his own dilemmas. Who is his Joker going to be?\"  I Am Batman #8 comes from Ridley, Christian Duce, Rex Lokus and ALW's Troy Peteri, with cover art by Lokus and Stephen Segovia and variant cover art by Olivier Coipel, Alex Sinclair and Mateus Manhanni. The issue goes on sale on April 12 from DC.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 2 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It, now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The charming rom-com anime series Science Fell in Love returns to the lab for another season of romantic scientist hijinks between the handsome kuudere Yukimura Shinya and the gorgeous Himuro Ayame. Just like in Season 1, these two amorous scientist students are taking center stage -- but there's more going on behind the scenes in Season 2.  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have plenty of classmates and friends to support them, including the tiny but tough Ibarada Ena and the dating sim enthusiast Inukai Kosuke, and these two colorful scientists have more chemistry than ever as Season 2 gets underway. Just like two celestial masses, they can't help attracting one another. RELATED: Aharen-San Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters                By now, Science Fell In Love can create contrast between its main couples to prove that lovestruck scientsts might develop their relationships in completely different ways. The Ayame/Shinya pair was the only one last season, but Season 2 also features the Fujiwara Suiu/Chris Florette pairing, and they follow a totally different set of rules. Instead of using reseach and tests on the science of love, Chris and Suiu simply go by feeling like anyone else would -- and Ena and Kosuke might soon follow their example.  Kosuke and Ena support the Shina/Ayame pairing but see no need to emulate what they are doing. They both know what they like and need no tests to prove it, and they may very well bond over this fact. As Episode 2 proves, they're growing closer than ever -- and they don't need oxytocin tests or charts to know it. Neither Ena nor Kosuke will admit it openly, but they have serious chemistry with one another and greatly enjoy each other's company. And anime series such as Science Fell in Love rarely tease new pairings like this without following through, meaning scientist couple #3 is surely around the corner. Fans of the first season may agree that this particular one is long overdue, which should add some spice to Season 2.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love: How Shinya & Ayame Actually Got Together in Season 1                So far, Season 2 of Science Fell in Love has only hinted at a Kosuke/Ena pairing with some suggestive winks about their feasibility, including a post-credits scene where Ayame unwittingly compares them to two celestial bodies being drawn together by gravity before settling into a comfortable shared orbit. Still, Kosuke and Ena's scenes together appear promising, with Ena finding herself unable to resist joining him for a game of off-brand Super Smash Bros., and nothing makes Kosuke happier than having her with him instead of playing against the CPU. Neither one feels satisfied unless the other is there.  If this potential couple does take off, they will most likely follow Chris and Suiu's example, proceeding with gut feelings and traditional social cues and rules rather than experiments. That would help set them apart from Ayame and Shinya, and Kosuke's and Ena's habit of gently teasing one another can further set these pairings apart to avoid redundancy. In fact, Ena and Kosuke have a subtle \"battle of wits\" element to their budding relationship, where these stubborn but kind young scientists are too proud to openly admit their feelings or make the first move. That actually makes Science Fell in Love's newest potential couple similar to the main couple of Kaguya-Sama: Love is War, whose third season is also airing in the Spring 2022 anime season. Fans of stubborn but charming couples are in for a double treat this season.                   Science Fell in Love: Why Did Ayame Originally Fall For Shinya?

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 2 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It, now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The charming rom-com anime series Science Fell in Love returns to the lab for another season of romantic scientist hijinks between the handsome kuudere Yukimura Shinya and the gorgeous Himuro Ayame. Just like in Season 1, these two amorous scientist students are taking center stage -- but there's more going on behind the scenes in Season 2.  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have plenty of classmates and friends to support them, including the tiny but tough Ibarada Ena and the dating sim enthusiast Inukai Kosuke, and these two colorful scientists have more chemistry than ever as Season 2 gets underway. Just like two celestial masses, they can't help attracting one another. RELATED: Aharen-San Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters                By now, Science Fell In Love can create contrast between its main couples to prove that lovestruck scientsts might develop their relationships in completely different ways. The Ayame/Shinya pair was the only one last season, but Season 2 also features the Fujiwara Suiu/Chris Florette pairing, and they follow a totally different set of rules. Instead of using reseach and tests on the science of love, Chris and Suiu simply go by feeling like anyone else would -- and Ena and Kosuke might soon follow their example.  Kosuke and Ena support the Shina/Ayame pairing but see no need to emulate what they are doing. They both know what they like and need no tests to prove it, and they may very well bond over this fact. As Episode 2 proves, they're growing closer than ever -- and they don't need oxytocin tests or charts to know it. Neither Ena nor Kosuke will admit it openly, but they have serious chemistry with one another and greatly enjoy each other's company. And anime series such as Science Fell in Love rarely tease new pairings like this without following through, meaning scientist couple #3 is surely around the corner. Fans of the first season may agree that this particular one is long overdue, which should add some spice to Season 2.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love: How Shinya & Ayame Actually Got Together in Season 1                So far, Season 2 of Science Fell in Love has only hinted at a Kosuke/Ena pairing with some suggestive winks about their feasibility, including a post-credits scene where Ayame unwittingly compares them to two celestial bodies being drawn together by gravity before settling into a comfortable shared orbit. Still, Kosuke and Ena's scenes together appear promising, with Ena finding herself unable to resist joining him for a game of off-brand Super Smash Bros., and nothing makes Kosuke happier than having her with him instead of playing against the CPU. Neither one feels satisfied unless the other is there.  If this potential couple does take off, they will most likely follow Chris and Suiu's example, proceeding with gut feelings and traditional social cues and rules rather than experiments. That would help set them apart from Ayame and Shinya, and Kosuke's and Ena's habit of gently teasing one another can further set these pairings apart to avoid redundancy. In fact, Ena and Kosuke have a subtle \"battle of wits\" element to their budding relationship, where these stubborn but kind young scientists are too proud to openly admit their feelings or make the first move. That actually makes Science Fell in Love's newest potential couple similar to the main couple of Kaguya-Sama: Love is War, whose third season is also airing in the Spring 2022 anime season. Fans of stubborn but charming couples are in for a double treat this season.                   Science Fell in Love: Why Did Ayame Originally Fall For Shinya?

Home Anime Shield Hero: What You Should Know About the Filolial Race    Shield Hero: What You Should Know About the Filolial Race  By Louis Kemner Published 18 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In The Rising of the Shield Hero, the avian filolials are a fascinating species found all over the kingdom of Melromarc.                 The Rising of the Shield Hero is a popular isekai animated series that returned in the Spring 2022 anime season for more otherworldly mayhem. There's a lot to keep track of as Season 2 begins, including a few exotic species and races. New and returning fans alike might want to brush up on who's who and what's what in this ever-expanding universe.  For example, there are demi-humans with animal tails and ears, such as the tanuki girl Raphtalia, as well as the avian filolial race, to which the colorful character Filo belongs. A variety of filolials have appeared so far in Shield Hero, and their race could potentially play a major role in deciding the future of this entire fantasy realm. RELATED: Shield Hero: Who Is the True Ruler of Melromarc?          The Biology Of The Filolial Race In Shield Hero                Filolials are intelligent avian creatures that are hatched from eggs. Like many birds, filolial hatchlings will immediately seek a parental figure and imprint it onto their minds. These animals are also directly influenced by the chocobo species in the Final Fantasy games, meaning filolials are excellent runners that can easily keep pace with horses, land dragons and other fast-moving creatures. They are capable of carrying a human rider like a horse, and can also pull ordinary wagons for hours on end. In combat they can use wind-based magic, their beaks and talon-based attacks to deal damage to their enemies.  Some filolials can transform into a human form and back again at will, and the human form's apparent age seems to reflect the filolial's actual age. When it transforms, a young filolial will look like a child with a juvenile personality and worldview to match. Filolials can even speak while in human form, and have angel-like wings on their backs as well. Notably, they will grow much larger when they transform back to bird form, so they are liable to tear their clothes apart in the process. Luckily, special clothing can be made from a filolial's hair to circumvent this issue. Finally, the filolials seen in Shield Hero are known for their community-oriented behavior, such as large numbers working in perfect unison to fight a much larger foe. In a similar vein, they can use the upright feathers on their heads to communicate telepathically from a distance.  RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          Notable Filolials In Rising of the Shield Hero                 Only two named filolials have appeared so far in The Rising of the Shield Hero, but both have a major role to play and represent their race well. The first to appear was the newly-hatched Filo, whom Naofumi simply named after her race. Filo is no ordinary filolial -- she has the potential to become a queen, and if she powers up enough, she may develop a few ahoge on her head to mark her status. She can use wind magic and melee attacks like most other filolials, and enjoys pulling Naofumi's wagon during long journeys across Melromarc. Filo views Naofumi as a mother hen and is attached to him -- to the point of making Raphtalia deeply jealous. Despite that, she and Raphtalia get along like foster sisters in Naofumi's party.  The other major filolial seen so far is the queen herself, Fitoria. She has three ahoge on her head to mark her authority and magical power, and she is deeply invested in the Shield Hero's success against the Waves. However, Fitoria can also be demanding and ruthless, stating that if Naofumi cannot reconcile with the other three Cardinal Heroes as a team, Fitoria will simply kill them all and allow four replacement heroes to be summoned. In Fitoria's eyes, protecting the world is vastly more important than the personal feud between the Cardinal Heroes -- or their lives. Fitoria will support Naofumi and Filo for now, but if they fail her, they might pay for it with their lives. Rising of the Shield Hero's queen has no time for games.

The Rising of the Shield Hero is a popular isekai animated series that returned in the Spring 2022 anime season for more otherworldly mayhem. There's a lot to keep track of as Season 2 begins, including a few exotic species and races. New and returning fans alike might want to brush up on who's who and what's what in this ever-expanding universe.  For example, there are demi-humans with animal tails and ears, such as the tanuki girl Raphtalia, as well as the avian filolial race, to which the colorful character Filo belongs. A variety of filolials have appeared so far in Shield Hero, and their race could potentially play a major role in deciding the future of this entire fantasy realm. RELATED: Shield Hero: Who Is the True Ruler of Melromarc?          The Biology Of The Filolial Race In Shield Hero                Filolials are intelligent avian creatures that are hatched from eggs. Like many birds, filolial hatchlings will immediately seek a parental figure and imprint it onto their minds. These animals are also directly influenced by the chocobo species in the Final Fantasy games, meaning filolials are excellent runners that can easily keep pace with horses, land dragons and other fast-moving creatures. They are capable of carrying a human rider like a horse, and can also pull ordinary wagons for hours on end. In combat they can use wind-based magic, their beaks and talon-based attacks to deal damage to their enemies.  Some filolials can transform into a human form and back again at will, and the human form's apparent age seems to reflect the filolial's actual age. When it transforms, a young filolial will look like a child with a juvenile personality and worldview to match. Filolials can even speak while in human form, and have angel-like wings on their backs as well. Notably, they will grow much larger when they transform back to bird form, so they are liable to tear their clothes apart in the process. Luckily, special clothing can be made from a filolial's hair to circumvent this issue. Finally, the filolials seen in Shield Hero are known for their community-oriented behavior, such as large numbers working in perfect unison to fight a much larger foe. In a similar vein, they can use the upright feathers on their heads to communicate telepathically from a distance.  RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          Notable Filolials In Rising of the Shield Hero                 Only two named filolials have appeared so far in The Rising of the Shield Hero, but both have a major role to play and represent their race well. The first to appear was the newly-hatched Filo, whom Naofumi simply named after her race. Filo is no ordinary filolial -- she has the potential to become a queen, and if she powers up enough, she may develop a few ahoge on her head to mark her status. She can use wind magic and melee attacks like most other filolials, and enjoys pulling Naofumi's wagon during long journeys across Melromarc. Filo views Naofumi as a mother hen and is attached to him -- to the point of making Raphtalia deeply jealous. Despite that, she and Raphtalia get along like foster sisters in Naofumi's party.  The other major filolial seen so far is the queen herself, Fitoria. She has three ahoge on her head to mark her authority and magical power, and she is deeply invested in the Shield Hero's success against the Waves. However, Fitoria can also be demanding and ruthless, stating that if Naofumi cannot reconcile with the other three Cardinal Heroes as a team, Fitoria will simply kill them all and allow four replacement heroes to be summoned. In Fitoria's eyes, protecting the world is vastly more important than the personal feud between the Cardinal Heroes -- or their lives. Fitoria will support Naofumi and Filo for now, but if they fail her, they might pay for it with their lives. Rising of the Shield Hero's queen has no time for games.

Warning: The following contains spoilers for Episodes 1 and 2 of Moon Knight, now on Disney+.Gods often have an attitude and, according to the cast of Moon Knight, Khonshu is no exception.  Speaking to IGN, Oscar Isaac, May Calamawy, and Ethan Hawke jokingly opened up about whether the Egyptian Moon god responsible for Moon Knight's suit was a \"diva behind the scenes.\" Calamawy stated \"No, I felt like I just wasn't putting up with his crap in front of the camera,\" while Isaac explained how the show managed to mo-cap Khonshu's body. \"We had a really great actor named Kareem, and he had to wear this big green pole over his head,\" said Isaac. The star, who plays protagonist Steven Grant, acknowledged that \"there were... tricky, tricky days to shoot those because sometimes you just can't help but look at someone's face when they're talking and to kind of change your mind, to just look up like three feet above them onto it, to a green pole with ping pongs on them.\"  RELATED: Is Khonshu A Friend or Foe?    Similarly, Hawke made a joke about the Egyptian pantheon's attitudes before getting serious and admitting his fondness for Khonshu's visual design. \"I love all that kind of mysticism and the special effects... I'm super interested in all that stuff and I get a huge kick out of it,\" Hawke said. \"The finished version has F. Murray Abraham doing the voice, and he's always been one of my favorites.\" First appearing in 1980's Moon Knight #1, Khonshu is a member of the alien Ennead race whom Ancient Egyptians worshiped as deities, thus inspiring their classic mythology. The Disney+ show's Khonshu has mostly stayed loyal to his comic design, appearing as bird skull-faced entity dressed in bandages and carrying a crescent moon staff. As Marc Specter reveals in the Moon Knight Episode 2, \"Summon the Suit,\" his role as Khonshu's avatar is to \"protect the vulnerable and deliver Khonshu's justice to those who hurt them.\" Despite partnering with Marc, Khonshu is vocally disdainful of Steven Grant, one of the hero's alters, who was previously oblivious to his dissociative identity disorder and blamed his frequent blackouts on sleepwalking.  Related: Moody Moon Knight Promo Takes Marc Spector's Fight to the Pyramids Moon Knight's conflict revolves around Steven becoming unwittingly involved in Marc and Khonshu's war against cult leader Arthur Harrow, who seeks to awaken the latter's rival deity Ammut. Harrow reveals that he was a previous avatar of Khonshu and is quite familiar with the god's temperament. Furthermore, as Marc discloses to Steven, Khonshu has been considering Marc's wife Layla El-Faouly for his next avatar, explaining his reason for abandoning her and fleeing to London.

Spy x Family released new art to celebrate the anime's successful premiere.  The Spy x Family TV series made its long-awaited premiere on April 9, and to celebrate, several new pieces of art by creator Tatsuya Endo were released. The first image comes from the anime's official Twitter account, which shared a dynamic new image of the Forger family reaching for the TV remote, presumably to watch their own show. The second image and third images were shared by Endo on his personal Twitter account, and depict Anya Forger watching TV and then taking a nap afterwards. RELATED: Spy x Family's Premiere Introduces the World's Most Adorably Awkward Father-Daughter Duo              Spy x Family tells the story of a super spy known only by his codename, Twilight. When his latest mission requires him to pretend to be a regular family man in order to get close to his next target, Twilight takes on the alias \"Loid Forger,\" adopts a daughter, Anya, and quickly enters into a shotgun marriage with a seemingly normal file clerk named Yor. Unfortunately for the new Mr. Forger, his new family has secrets of their own: his wife lives a double-life as a femme-fatale assassin, and his daughter possesses psychic powers that immediately clue her in on her new parents' dangerous professions.  The series was originally created by Endo in 2019, when it debuted as an exclusive title for Shonen Jump+, the digital manga spinoff of Shueisha's popular Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The series has since become one of the service's biggest hits, with over 12 million copies in circulation worldwide. In addition to its runaway commercial success, the manga has been well recieved by critics as well, and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2021. RELATED: Spy x Family Crafts a Heartfelt Adaptation of Tatsuya Endo's Beloved Manga The new anime was recently voted the most anticipated show of the spring 2022 season and premiered in Japan to strong ratings. The show features an all-star voice cast, including Takuya Eguchi (Haikyuu!!), Atsumi Tanezaki (Mob Psycho 100) and Saori Hayami (Kakegurui). The anime is directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who previously worked on shows such as Le Chevalier D'eon and Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. Production in the series is being handled as a collaboration between Wit Studio, which previously worked on the first three seasons of Attack on Titan and the acclaimed Ranking of Kings, and CloverWorks, the studio behind last season's biggest surprise hit, My Dress-Up Darling.  The Spy x Family anime is being simulcast on Crunchyroll. Endo's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Spy x Family released new art to celebrate the anime's successful premiere.  The Spy x Family TV series made its long-awaited premiere on April 9, and to celebrate, several new pieces of art by creator Tatsuya Endo were released. The first image comes from the anime's official Twitter account, which shared a dynamic new image of the Forger family reaching for the TV remote, presumably to watch their own show. The second image and third images were shared by Endo on his personal Twitter account, and depict Anya Forger watching TV and then taking a nap afterwards. RELATED: Spy x Family's Premiere Introduces the World's Most Adorably Awkward Father-Daughter Duo              Spy x Family tells the story of a super spy known only by his codename, Twilight. When his latest mission requires him to pretend to be a regular family man in order to get close to his next target, Twilight takes on the alias \"Loid Forger,\" adopts a daughter, Anya, and quickly enters into a shotgun marriage with a seemingly normal file clerk named Yor. Unfortunately for the new Mr. Forger, his new family has secrets of their own: his wife lives a double-life as a femme-fatale assassin, and his daughter possesses psychic powers that immediately clue her in on her new parents' dangerous professions.  The series was originally created by Endo in 2019, when it debuted as an exclusive title for Shonen Jump+, the digital manga spinoff of Shueisha's popular Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The series has since become one of the service's biggest hits, with over 12 million copies in circulation worldwide. In addition to its runaway commercial success, the manga has been well recieved by critics as well, and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2021. RELATED: Spy x Family Crafts a Heartfelt Adaptation of Tatsuya Endo's Beloved Manga The new anime was recently voted the most anticipated show of the spring 2022 season and premiered in Japan to strong ratings. The show features an all-star voice cast, including Takuya Eguchi (Haikyuu!!), Atsumi Tanezaki (Mob Psycho 100) and Saori Hayami (Kakegurui). The anime is directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who previously worked on shows such as Le Chevalier D'eon and Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. Production in the series is being handled as a collaboration between Wit Studio, which previously worked on the first three seasons of Attack on Titan and the acclaimed Ranking of Kings, and CloverWorks, the studio behind last season's biggest surprise hit, My Dress-Up Darling.  The Spy x Family anime is being simulcast on Crunchyroll. Endo's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Home Anime The 10 Best Anime Couples Of All Time, Ranked    The 10 Best Anime Couples Of All Time, Ranked  By Derek DeSantis Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Anime has produced some of the most romantic and heartbreaking relationships in animation history.                  Anime is a medium that stretches across different genres and demographics. The most popular anime in the world range from battle shonen to psychological thrillers. But regardless of the genre, most anime indulge in familiar tropes and subplots.  RELATED: 10 Romance Anime Critics Actually Loved No matter what anime is being discussed, there's a near certainty that at some point, one or many of the characters will end up with a romantic storyline. These plots can take center stage or stay on the sidelines, but they are responsible for giving fans some of the most iconic, romantic couples in fictional history.  10          Bakuman: Takagi And Kaya Are Middle School Sweethearts                 Bakuman is a unique addition to the Shonen Jump lineup as a competitive, battle shonen story about the creation of battle shonen manga. It depicts the artistic duo responsible for creating Death Note in a fictionalized setting where the two compete with other mangaka to become the highest-selling and most successful artists in Shonen Jump.  But no shonen anime would be complete without a bit of romance. Bakuman's healthiest couple is Takagi and Kaya. Sweethearts since middle school, the two struggled at times but never forgot their love for each other and stuck it out to the very end.  9          Steins;Gate: Okabe And Kurisu Overcame Their Differences                 Steins;Gate is a sci-fi thriller that follows a group of ragtag scientists as they invent the world's first time machine. It's a harrowing tale with twists and turns that'll captivate and confuse fans. But at the core of this anime is a romantic story between Kurisu and Okabe. These two scientists couldn't be more different, with one having a true academic background and the other having been through the wild internet world. But together they overcame those differences and formed an iconic pair that anime fans love.  8          Death Note: Light And Misa Are A True Power Couple                 The term \"best\" can mean a lot of different things. While anime's best couples are pairs that fans find touching and emotionally fulfilling, some couples become iconic for how troublesome they are. Light and Misa may be the villains of their story, but they form a problematic duo that managed to shake up the entire world. RELATED: 10 Worst Anime Couples Who Can't Stop Fighting With Each Other Together, the two of them were behind the largest string of serial murders and massively affected the world's average crime rates. They may not be as lovable as many other couples, but they were effective.  7          Hunter X Hunter: Meruem And Komugi Died In Each Other's Arms                 The Chimera Ant arc is one of the most philosophically deep and important arcs in anime. Highly regarded as one of Hunter X Hunter's highest achievements, the Chimera Ant arc introduced the characters Meruem and Komugi. While Meruem remained the final antagonist of the arc, his bond with Komugi garnered immense empathy from viewers. The two died in each other's company as they slowly withered away from poison, playing one final game of Gungi. It's a devastating scene that proves even villains have heart.  6          Yuri On Ice: Yuri And Victor Are A Rare Case Of Maturity In Anime                 Yuri on Ice is a sports drama that follows an aging figure skater making his last attempts to prove himself on the international stage. To do so, Yuri recruits the world-famous Russian skater, Victor Nikiforov. With Victor's help, Yuri learns to overcome his feelings of insecurity and embraces a style of skating that highlights his innate beauty. Yuri on Ice is a sensual anime that explores complex emotions and a heartwarming romance between two athletic titans. Fans were overwhelmed with love when they saw Yuri and Victor kiss for the first time.  5          Yu Yu Hakusho: Yusuke And Keiko Are A Classic Shonen Couple                 Yu Yu Hakusho was one of the all-time classic shonen anime that many '90s kids grew up with. As one of the first anime to find its audience in the West, Yu Yu Hakusho had a strong impression on the current anime landscape. RELATED: 5 Harsh Realities Of Dating A Tsundere (& 5 Perks) While the anime is not without mistakes, most notably a somewhat weak final arc, most fans can admit that Yusuke's budding relationship with his childhood best friend Keiko is one of the most heartwarming and enviable romances in all of anime.  4          Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood: Edward And Winry Are Relationship Goals                 When it comes to battle shonen anime, many fans complain that female characters are underutilized and reduced to stereotypical, boring archetypes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood defies these criticisms by presenting one of the most narratively interesting and capable women in anime history, Winry Rockbell. While Winry does fulfill the romantic interest role for the main character, fans find thier relationship more mature than almost any other battle shonen anime. Winry and Edward are constantly labeled as one of anime's best couples.  3          Beastars: Legoshi And Haru Are An Unorthodox Romantic Pairing                 Beastars is one of the freshest new anime to come out within the past 5 years. While the concept of an anthropomorphized animal society is far from unique, Beastars manages to impress with its grounded sociological dynamics and refreshingly authentic character types. RELATED: 10 Anime Relationships That Deserve A Second Chance The story follows Legoshi and Haru as they come to terms with their romantic feelings for each other in a world that does not want a wolf and rabbit to be in love. Their story is brutally complicated but continues to charm fans to their peculiar dilemma.  2          Bloom Into You: Yuu And Touko Explore The Complex Nature Of Love                 Bloom Into You is a yuri anime that follows an aromantic young girl as she slowly grapples with the affection of one of her upperclassmen. Yuu is a painfully relatable character for anime fans who don't feel and can't understand romantic attraction. Bloom Into You tackles complex character dynamics, balancing the delicate emotions of a partnership between two people who want vastly different things from each other. While Yuu and Touko's partnership feels troubling at times, it never loses its sense of authenticity or commitment to the character's realistic feelings.  1          Naruto: Minato And Kushina Brought Sensitivity And Compassion To Naruto Romance                Naruto is plagued with criticisms towards its treatment of female characters. Women in Naruto are often sidelined compared to their male counterparts and are almost always reduced to frustrating archetypes that bring nothing new to anime storytelling. While Kushina falls in one of these usual archetypes for female characters, her relationship with Minato brought a sensitivity and compassion to the Naruto world that still managed to feel unique. This pair defined the Naruto series and became one of the most iconic couples in only a few short moments.                  8 Romance Anime Characters Who Ended Up Choosing Nobody  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime anime Hunter X Hunter Naruto Shippuden death note Beastars     About The Author      Derek DeSantis                                     (53 Articles Published)       More                     From Derek DeSantis          Popular                     TV News   Percy Jackson's Live Action Disney+ Series Casts Its Star                      Nerd Culture   EXCLUSIVE: Transformers Debuts Wild Rider, Blitzwing Legacy Figures                      TV News   Stranger Things Creators Compare Season 4 to Game of Thrones                       Nerd Culture   Namor Cosplayer Brings Marvel's Sub-Mariner to Life                      TV Features   Bobby Hill\u2019s Serious King of the Hill Episodes Are the Most Relatable                      TV Features   Outer Range's Shaun Sipos Teases the Good, the Bad and the Supernatural        Comic Book Reviews Comic Book Previews                      Image Comics' Radiant Red #2 Comic Review   Image Comics Release: 04.6.22                      Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review                        DC's Suicide Squad #14 Comic Review   DC Comics Release: 04.5.22                      Marvel's X-Force Annual #1 Comic Review   Marvel Comics Release: 04.6.22                      DC's Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 Comic Review   DC Comics Release: 04.5.22                      Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing       See More                      Bylines in Blood #4                        The Naughty List #1   AfterShock Comics                      The Joneses #1   AWA Studios Release: 04.6.22                      The Lion and the Eagle #3   AfterShock Comics Release: 04.27.22                      Kaiju Score: Steal From the Gods #1   AfterShock Comics Release: 04.13.22                      Almost American #5   AfterShock Comics Release: 03.30.22     See More      trending now                    Flash Screening Leak Teases 10-20 Minute Team-Up With Affleck's Batman                      10 Worst Things About Shang-Chi In The MCU                     It's Time To Admit That Thing and Alicia Masters Are One of Comics' Top Couples           Read Next in anime                     The Six Best Spider-Man Suits of the Past 60 Years                      What to Expect From Requiem of the Rose King's Darker Second Cour                      The Genius of Shigaraki Tomura, My Hero Academia's Symbol of Fear                        Thor 4 Merch Reveals First Artwork of Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher                      Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army                      Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Outdid Spider-Man: No Way Home in One Massive Way                       Christopher Lloyd to Star Spirit Halloween Store Movie                       Bylines in Blood #4                      Outlander: Wait, Who's in the Jail Cell?

RELATED: 5 Harsh Realities Of Dating A Tsundere (& 5 Perks) While the anime is not without mistakes, most notably a somewhat weak final arc, most fans can admit that Yusuke's budding relationship with his childhood best friend Keiko is one of the most heartwarming and enviable romances in all of anime.  4          Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood: Edward And Winry Are Relationship Goals                 When it comes to battle shonen anime, many fans complain that female characters are underutilized and reduced to stereotypical, boring archetypes. Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood defies these criticisms by presenting one of the most narratively interesting and capable women in anime history, Winry Rockbell. While Winry does fulfill the romantic interest role for the main character, fans find thier relationship more mature than almost any other battle shonen anime. Winry and Edward are constantly labeled as one of anime's best couples.  3          Beastars: Legoshi And Haru Are An Unorthodox Romantic Pairing                 Beastars is one of the freshest new anime to come out within the past 5 years. While the concept of an anthropomorphized animal society is far from unique, Beastars manages to impress with its grounded sociological dynamics and refreshingly authentic character types. RELATED: 10 Anime Relationships That Deserve A Second Chance The story follows Legoshi and Haru as they come to terms with their romantic feelings for each other in a world that does not want a wolf and rabbit to be in love. Their story is brutally complicated but continues to charm fans to their peculiar dilemma.  2          Bloom Into You: Yuu And Touko Explore The Complex Nature Of Love                 Bloom Into You is a yuri anime that follows an aromantic young girl as she slowly grapples with the affection of one of her upperclassmen. Yuu is a painfully relatable character for anime fans who don't feel and can't understand romantic attraction. Bloom Into You tackles complex character dynamics, balancing the delicate emotions of a partnership between two people who want vastly different things from each other. While Yuu and Touko's partnership feels troubling at times, it never loses its sense of authenticity or commitment to the character's realistic feelings.  1          Naruto: Minato And Kushina Brought Sensitivity And Compassion To Naruto Romance                Naruto is plagued with criticisms towards its treatment of female characters. Women in Naruto are often sidelined compared to their male counterparts and are almost always reduced to frustrating archetypes that bring nothing new to anime storytelling. While Kushina falls in one of these usual archetypes for female characters, her relationship with Minato brought a sensitivity and compassion to the Naruto world that still managed to feel unique. This pair defined the Naruto series and became one of the most iconic couples in only a few short moments.                  8 Romance Anime Characters Who Ended Up Choosing Nobody  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime anime Hunter X Hunter Naruto Shippuden death note Beastars     About The Author      Derek DeSantis                                     (53 Articles Published)       More                     From Derek DeSantis          Popular                     TV News   Percy Jackson's Live Action Disney+ Series Casts Its Star                      Nerd Culture   EXCLUSIVE: Transformers Debuts Wild Rider, Blitzwing Legacy Figures                      TV News   Stranger Things Creators Compare Season 4 to Game of Thrones                       Nerd Culture   Namor Cosplayer Brings Marvel's Sub-Mariner to Life                      TV Features   Bobby Hill\u2019s Serious King of the Hill Episodes Are the Most Relatable                      TV Features   Outer Range's Shaun Sipos Teases the Good, the Bad and the Supernatural        Comic Book Reviews Comic Book Previews                      Image Comics' Radiant Red #2 Comic Review   Image Comics Release: 04.6.22                      Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review                        DC's Suicide Squad #14 Comic Review   DC Comics Release: 04.5.22                      Marvel's X-Force Annual #1 Comic Review   Marvel Comics Release: 04.6.22                      DC's Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 Comic Review   DC Comics Release: 04.5.22                      Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing       See More                      Bylines in Blood #4                        The Naughty List #1   AfterShock Comics                      The Joneses #1   AWA Studios Release: 04.6.22                      The Lion and the Eagle #3   AfterShock Comics Release: 04.27.22                      Kaiju Score: Steal From the Gods #1   AfterShock Comics Release: 04.13.22                      Almost American #5   AfterShock Comics Release: 03.30.22     See More      trending now                    Flash Screening Leak Teases 10-20 Minute Team-Up With Affleck's Batman                      10 Worst Things About Shang-Chi In The MCU                     It's Time To Admit That Thing and Alicia Masters Are One of Comics' Top Couples           Read Next in anime                     The Six Best Spider-Man Suits of the Past 60 Years                      What to Expect From Requiem of the Rose King's Darker Second Cour                      The Genius of Shigaraki Tomura, My Hero Academia's Symbol of Fear                        Thor 4 Merch Reveals First Artwork of Christian Bale's Gorr the God Butcher                      Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army                      Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Outdid Spider-Man: No Way Home in One Massive Way                       Christopher Lloyd to Star Spirit Halloween Store Movie                       Bylines in Blood #4                      Outlander: Wait, Who's in the Jail Cell?

Home Comics Comic Book Reviews Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review    Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review  By Dustin Holland Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   D.A. Medina, 3858 and Fernando Kern's Below Sycamore #1 introduces readers to a fascinating world of drugs, demons and desperate people.                  In 2019, writers D.A. Medina and 3858 teamed up to create a play about demonic figures walking the earth and the cyclical nature of addiction. After the success of their their theatrical debut, Medina and 3858 recruited artist Fernando Kern and designer Zueoner to help them develop the play into a comic series. Soon, Below Sycamore attracted the attention of actor Danny Trejo and rapper Mr. Criminal, whose likenesses are featured prominently throughout the series. Below Sycamore #1 is an intriguing first issue that sets the stage for an exciting, poingant series.   Bellow Sycamore #1 follows two young men, Chucho and JD as they struggle to find their way in the world. The two friends are altar boys at their local church, but JD also works for a fearsome drug dealer, known as Grumpy. He does his best to find a balance between these two elements of his life, but as his situation becomes increasingly dangerous, it looks like he will have to make a difficult decision. As JD tries to navigate his perilous path, the two young men are followed by supernatural creatures who are hellbent on protecting them.  Related: AWA's The Joneses #1 Comic Review                Medina and 3858 introduce a wide variety of characters in this first issue. While Chucho and JD steal the show, the writers introduce the audience to priests, gangsters, addicts in recovery and corrupt police. This inclusive and expansive view of the neighborhood helps make Chucho's world feel lived in while laying the foundation for an intricate plot. The otherworldly elements of Below Sycamore #1 add a sense of mystery to the proceedings and contrast with the numerous Christian themes and images to build tension. Medina and 3858 include various opposing forces -- all revolving around drugs and addiction to present an empathetic and exciting exploration of the topic.   Kern's artwork helps Medina establish a fast pace bouncing between various characters without leaving the reader behind. His character designs are naturalistic but cartoony enough to be distinctive. His subtle, almost mundane costume designs make the supernatural characters stand out and appear particularly out of place against the otherwise normal background. Kern uses this sort of contrast masterfully throughout Below Sycamore #1. JD's body language changes drastically from when he is at church to when he is on the street. Similarly, scenes of violence are fast brutal interruptions of the otherwise calm, steady pace of the story.   Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                There's nothing particularly subtle about Below Sycamore #1. The comic definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, but Medina, 3858 and Kern work together to create a really compelling first issue. Their characters feel like normal, everyday people which makes the frightening situations they find themselves in all the more emotionally intense. Readers looking for solid crime fiction with a paranormal twist or a thoughtful exploration of addiction's impact on communities will be delighted by the first issue of Below Sycamore.

Medina, 3858 and Fernando Kern's Below Sycamore #1 introduces readers to a fascinating world of drugs, demons and desperate people.                  In 2019, writers D.A. Medina and 3858 teamed up to create a play about demonic figures walking the earth and the cyclical nature of addiction. After the success of their their theatrical debut, Medina and 3858 recruited artist Fernando Kern and designer Zueoner to help them develop the play into a comic series. Soon, Below Sycamore attracted the attention of actor Danny Trejo and rapper Mr. Criminal, whose likenesses are featured prominently throughout the series. Below Sycamore #1 is an intriguing first issue that sets the stage for an exciting, poingant series.   Bellow Sycamore #1 follows two young men, Chucho and JD as they struggle to find their way in the world. The two friends are altar boys at their local church, but JD also works for a fearsome drug dealer, known as Grumpy. He does his best to find a balance between these two elements of his life, but as his situation becomes increasingly dangerous, it looks like he will have to make a difficult decision. As JD tries to navigate his perilous path, the two young men are followed by supernatural creatures who are hellbent on protecting them.

While Chucho and JD steal the show, the writers introduce the audience to priests, gangsters, addicts in recovery and corrupt police. This inclusive and expansive view of the neighborhood helps make Chucho's world feel lived in while laying the foundation for an intricate plot. The otherworldly elements of Below Sycamore #1 add a sense of mystery to the proceedings and contrast with the numerous Christian themes and images to build tension. Medina and 3858 include various opposing forces -- all revolving around drugs and addiction to present an empathetic and exciting exploration of the topic.   Kern's artwork helps Medina establish a fast pace bouncing between various characters without leaving the reader behind. His character designs are naturalistic but cartoony enough to be distinctive. His subtle, almost mundane costume designs make the supernatural characters stand out and appear particularly out of place against the otherwise normal background. Kern uses this sort of contrast masterfully throughout Below Sycamore #1. JD's body language changes drastically from when he is at church to when he is on the street. Similarly, scenes of violence are fast brutal interruptions of the otherwise calm, steady pace of the story.   Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                There's nothing particularly subtle about Below Sycamore #1. The comic definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, but Medina, 3858 and Kern work together to create a really compelling first issue. Their characters feel like normal, everyday people which makes the frightening situations they find themselves in all the more emotionally intense. Readers looking for solid crime fiction with a paranormal twist or a thoughtful exploration of addiction's impact on communities will be delighted by the first issue of Below Sycamore.

CBR has the exclusive trailer premiere for I Hate This Place, a new supernatural horror series from writer Kyle Starks (Assassin Nation, The Six Sidekicks of Trigger Keaton), artist Artyom Topilin (Ice Cream Man Presents: Quarantine Comix Special), colorist Lee Loughridge (Deadly Class, The Good Asian) and letterer Pat Brosseau (Birthright, Manifest Destiny). The trailer sees a couple looking for a fresh start as they inherit a family farm. Once they arrive, the two quickly learn that the place is home to all kinds of supernatural terrors they could have never been prepared for. These terrors include all kinds of ghastly demon-like creatures capable of causing copious amounts of bloodshed.   RELATED: The Logic of Lettering Unites Superman, Spider-Man and Many Image Comics    The official synopsis for I Hate This Place #1 reads, \"After inheriting a farmhouse, Trudy and Gabby are ready to start the next chapter of their lives together...except it's already home to a mysterious force that's attracted ghosts, aliens, and all kinds of supernatural beings for decades. Now, Gabby and Trudy must play by the 'house rules' in order to survive the most frightening place on Earth.\" X-Men writer Gerry Duggan praised the series for having \"everything you want in a comic, and it should come with a neck brace as it shifts from crime, horror and romance at whiplash speeds.\"  RELATED: Image Comics' Science Fiction Gem Saga Is Setting Up An Epic Confrontation Each issue of I Hate This Place will have open-to-order covers with clean and explicit options available for fans and retailers -- I Hate This Place and F*ck This Place, which is the series' original title. Both versions will be available at comic book shops on May 18. Standard editions will also be available on digital platforms, including Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, comiXology and Google Play. \"We\u2019ve heard the requests from fans and retailers to have different versions of I Hate This Place #1 that meet their needs, so we\u2019ve decided to offer a variety of options for each issue of the series,\u201d said Skybound Entertainment editor Jon Moisan previously told Image Comics. \u201cKyle, Artyom and Lee have created a captivating horror series that really speaks to the fears we have about our uncertain futures, and we know you\u2019re going to fall in love with the first issue, no matter the title on the cover.\u201d  I Hate This Place #1 comes from Starks, Topilin, Loughridge and Brosseau, with cover art by Topilin and Loughridge.

Home TV TV Features Sorry, The Walking Dead\u2019s Midseason Finale Was a Waste of Time    Sorry, The Walking Dead\u2019s Midseason Finale Was a Waste of Time  By Blake Hawkins Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The Walking Dead's \"Acts of God\" had the potential to be a very good episode, but certain shortcomings made it fail to reach that potential.                  The following contains spoilers for The Walking Dead Season 11, Episode 16, \"Acts of God,\" which aired Sunday, April 10, on AMC.   Most fans of The Walking Dead would agree that, so far, Season 11 has been a success. The Reaper story arc might have been stretched out too far, but other than that, everything has been riveting. The Commonwealth presented everyone with the challenges that arise while living in safety, and Josh Hamilton has been brilliant as the uber-villainous Lance Hornsby. Even Negan showed a new side of himself by apologizing for his most vile act.  With all of that, fans were more than ready for the Season 11B midseason finale. With Leah as a bounty hunter, Maggie desperate to defend her people and Hornsby ready to unleash hell, \u201cActs of God\u201d was set up for success. Unfortunately, it ended up falling far short of viewers' high expectations for several different reasons. RELATED: The Walking Dead\u2019s Power Family Is About To Be Exposed          Leah\u2019s Death Was Predictable and Unrealistic                 When Lance hired Leah, it was obvious that she wasn\u2019t going to survive the altercation. However, the way the show handled it was a disappointment. Leah was touted as a military contract killer. That means she should have killed Maggie on sight, not just tied her up in a cabin. On top of that, she definitely should have been able to tie a better knot. Her background as a military expert felt even more forced after the episode, even taking into account that in a world where zombies are walking around, not everything is going to be realistic.  RELATED: The Walking Dead's Jeffrey Dean Morgan Shares Melancholic Wrap Photo          The Plot Armor Was Better Than Real Armor                 After the ordeal at Riverbend, it was only a matter of time before Hornsby decided to get rid of Daryl, Gabriel and Aaron. They knew it and the fans knew it. So when the Commonwealth soldiers fanned out and left the trio in a junkyard, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. Then the soldiers proved their lack of aim -- just like Star Wars\u2019 Stormtroopers -- because the three of them emerged nearly unscathed. Viewers didn't want any of their heroes to die, but it felt like the situation warranted something bigger happening. These were supposed to be trained soldiers, but they all died at the hands of a trio that hasn\u2019t handled guns in years.  RELATED: The Walking Dead's Newest Couple Is the Show's Cutest Yet          Marco Was A Scapegoat                In a midseason finale, the stakes have to be high, and given that this is the last season, The Walking Dead should be starting to whittle down some characters. Someone had to die, and if it couldn\u2019t be Aaron or Gabriel, it had to be Marco. He was the least important character aligned with Maggie, so when he stood up and acted like everything was fine, everyone expected him to be shot in the head. If the audience can\u2019t remember a character\u2019s name, they probably won\u2019t last long.  RELATED: The Walking Dead Dropped Its First F-Bomb in Four Years          Hornsby\u2019s Physical Transformation Was Too Corny                Lance Hornsby was always two-faced, but him literally becoming Two-Face from Batman was jut too much. Daryl only skimming his face was worth an eyeroll because if it had been any other character, Daryl wouldn\u2019t have missed. Hornsby\u2019s slow-motion coin flips were also unnecessarily dramatic. No one cared if he kills the people at Oceanside because almost all of them were unnamed anyway. That lack of connection with his potential victims made the episode's cliffhanger not impactful at all.  RELATED: The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus Celebrates Series Wrap With Touching Video          A Lack of Screen Time for Certain Characters Was Surprising                Daryl and Maggie needed to take center stage in \"Acts of God,\" but certain characters have been snubbed for a lot of the season. Yumiko, Magna, Dianne and Judith got almost no screen time at the Commonwealth. Back at the communities, Virgil, Luke and Gracie saw no screen time whatsoever. Obliviously, the series can\u2019t feature everyone in every episode, but some of them should have gotten a bit more of a look. As a whole, Season 11B was successful and paved the way for an exciting conclusion to The Walking Dead. \u201cActs of God\u201d wasn\u2019t bad, but it should have improved on the above aspects and then it would have been the important episode that it wanted to be. As it stands, it was a fine conclusion, but one full of untapped potential.  To see how the series concludes, watch The Walking Dead Season 11C. It will likely air later this year on AMC and be available to stream early on AMC+.

RELATED: The Walking Dead\u2019s Power Family Is About To Be Exposed          Leah\u2019s Death Was Predictable and Unrealistic                 When Lance hired Leah, it was obvious that she wasn\u2019t going to survive the altercation. However, the way the show handled it was a disappointment. Leah was touted as a military contract killer. That means she should have killed Maggie on sight, not just tied her up in a cabin. On top of that, she definitely should have been able to tie a better knot. Her background as a military expert felt even more forced after the episode, even taking into account that in a world where zombies are walking around, not everything is going to be realistic.  RELATED: The Walking Dead's Jeffrey Dean Morgan Shares Melancholic Wrap Photo          The Plot Armor Was Better Than Real Armor                 After the ordeal at Riverbend, it was only a matter of time before Hornsby decided to get rid of Daryl, Gabriel and Aaron. They knew it and the fans knew it. So when the Commonwealth soldiers fanned out and left the trio in a junkyard, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. Then the soldiers proved their lack of aim -- just like Star Wars\u2019 Stormtroopers -- because the three of them emerged nearly unscathed. Viewers didn't want any of their heroes to die, but it felt like the situation warranted something bigger happening. These were supposed to be trained soldiers, but they all died at the hands of a trio that hasn\u2019t handled guns in years.  RELATED: The Walking Dead's Newest Couple Is the Show's Cutest Yet          Marco Was A Scapegoat                In a midseason finale, the stakes have to be high, and given that this is the last season, The Walking Dead should be starting to whittle down some characters. Someone had to die, and if it couldn\u2019t be Aaron or Gabriel, it had to be Marco. He was the least important character aligned with Maggie, so when he stood up and acted like everything was fine, everyone expected him to be shot in the head. If the audience can\u2019t remember a character\u2019s name, they probably won\u2019t last long.  RELATED: The Walking Dead Dropped Its First F-Bomb in Four Years          Hornsby\u2019s Physical Transformation Was Too Corny                Lance Hornsby was always two-faced, but him literally becoming Two-Face from Batman was jut too much. Daryl only skimming his face was worth an eyeroll because if it had been any other character, Daryl wouldn\u2019t have missed. Hornsby\u2019s slow-motion coin flips were also unnecessarily dramatic. No one cared if he kills the people at Oceanside because almost all of them were unnamed anyway. That lack of connection with his potential victims made the episode's cliffhanger not impactful at all.  RELATED: The Walking Dead's Norman Reedus Celebrates Series Wrap With Touching Video          A Lack of Screen Time for Certain Characters Was Surprising                Daryl and Maggie needed to take center stage in \"Acts of God,\" but certain characters have been snubbed for a lot of the season. Yumiko, Magna, Dianne and Judith got almost no screen time at the Commonwealth. Back at the communities, Virgil, Luke and Gracie saw no screen time whatsoever. Obliviously, the series can\u2019t feature everyone in every episode, but some of them should have gotten a bit more of a look. As a whole, Season 11B was successful and paved the way for an exciting conclusion to The Walking Dead. \u201cActs of God\u201d wasn\u2019t bad, but it should have improved on the above aspects and then it would have been the important episode that it wanted to be. As it stands, it was a fine conclusion, but one full of untapped potential.  To see how the series concludes, watch The Walking Dead Season 11C. It will likely air later this year on AMC and be available to stream early on AMC+.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Episode 1, \u201cOperation Strix,\u201d now streaming on Crunchyroll.   It's too early to say with only one episode out, but Spy x Family might go down in history as one of the few anime adaptations that lived up to the hype. In fact, the adaptation took the source material and breathed life into it in a way that made the characters feel real and human. Episode 1 has gorgeous animation, the voices for both Twilight and Anya perfectly fit their characters and the music adds the right weight of emotionality.  The story isn't simple per se, as the premise has the potential to branch out into a number of different avenues, but it has a charming and heartwarming simplicity about it that easily sweeps viewers into the story. Spy x Family's basis is about a fake family who all have secrets to hide and reasons for hiding them -- even their last name, Forger, is very tongue in cheek -- but at its heart, it's about three individuals who have always longed to have a family and have found one in each other. RELATED: Spy x Family Crafts a Heartfelt Adaptation of Tatsuya Endo's Beloved Manga                Twilight is the best spy in the world. Not only is he able to lie without batting an eye but his disguises are flawless. Unfortunately, his latest mission, Operation Strix, is an important one in maintaining peace between the East and the West, but it demands that he play a role even he's not sure he can pull off: a father.  As Loid Forger, he goes to a nondescript orphanage to adopt a six-year-old who will be able to attend Eden Academy, the same school that the son of his target Donovan Desmond attends. There, he meets Anya, who seems to fit every single requirement: she's six years old, she can read and write and she can solve a difficult crossword puzzle in no time. The secret? Anya is a telepath. One of the great appeals of Spy x Family is its humor. Loid and Anya have a bit of an awkward start to their new father-daughter relationship. Loid is so out of his depth as a dad that he's utterly bewildered by Anya's behavior. It doesn't help that Anya is reading his thoughts and trying her best to accommodate them. As a spy, Loid is always thinking a few steps ahead, and poor Anya often misinterprets them with her childish logic. For example, she immediately hides when Loid starts looking out for enemies, or she tells Loid all of her likes and dislikes in an effort to help him \"understand\" her. Behind all the hilarious moments of Anya trying to follow Loid and please her new dad, she's insecure about her place in the Forger family.  RELATED: Spy x Family: Anya Faces Off Against the Manga's Version of Umbridge                Even though Loid picked Anya for the sole reason of her ability to read and write (never mind how she read his mind in order to do so), there's an undeniable bond between the two. Loid has taken on the identity of Twilight to preserve peace between Ostania and Westalis, while Anya had been experimented on in a facility. One of the new things that the anime added to the episode occurs near the end, when Loid finds Anya waiting for him even though he had directed her to the police station. As Anya hugs his leg, rubbing her face on it to comfort herself and confessing that she wants to go back to their home, Loid recalls Franky's words about Anya's past. She had been adopted four times and returned every single one of them, and has consequently had four different names: Anya Williams, Anya Levski, Anya Roche and Anya Klein. Every other thing about her identity had been wiped clean.  Even though he wasn't aware of it, maybe that's why Loid picked Anya and why he went to save her even though he knew that he could simply find another child to adopt for his mission. He saw himself in her. They're both orphans who have had multiple identities throughout their lives. The entire reason he chose to be a spy was so there would be no more orphans like him, and here was Anya who desperately wanted a family. And maybe, although he won't admit it, he wanted one too. Poor Loid is now experiencing the exhaustion that all first-time parents have. The after-credits scene after Anya thwacks Loid's face with the mail is one of the sweetest moments in the episode. Watching her face light up and then seeing her snuggle up next to Loid while he sleeps is utterly adorable. The Forgers may be a dysfunctional family, but after seeing Loid and Anya, how can viewers not root for them?

No great shonen anime is complete without a tournament arc. Yu Yu Hakusho has both the Dark and Demon World Tournaments, Jujutsu Kaisen has the \"Kyoto Goodwill Event\" arc and Dragon Ball has more than any viewer would care to count. The international, multigenerational sensation Naruto is no exception.  Naruto's \"Chunin Exams\" tournament arc played host to some of the most brutal battles in anime, not the least of which was the showdown between the series' female lead Haruno Sakura and her rival Yamanaka Ino. Sakura and Ino had competed fiercely with one another -- particularly for the affections of Uchiha Sasuke -- throughout the series. As such, it was only natural that the two should meet in a head-to-head battle in the preliminary rounds of the Chunin Exams tournament. RELATED: A Naruto Reddit Theory Explains How the Chunin Exam Arc Helps Character Development                 Fought over the course of episodes 41 and 42 of Season 1, the match between Ino and Sakura proved to be one of Naruto's most gripping. Not only did it reveal more of Sakura and Ino's shared complex history, but it also represented a pivotal moment in Sakura's development.  During the match, Ino attempted to use her signature Mind Transfer Jutsu against Sakura. The Mind Transfer Jutsu is a technique that allows the caster to occupy and control the body of an opponent. Ino's plan was to use the technique to take over Sakura's body and force her to concede the match. However, Sakura overcame the allegedly unbreakable technique and went on to battle Ino to a draw. RELATED: How Naruto\u2019s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's                 How was it that Sakura overpowered the Mind Transfer Jutsu? After all, the technique worked well enough in Episode 24, when Ino used it to review and copy Sakura's answers to the written exam, as well as against the formidable Sound ninja Kin Tsuchi in the Forest of Death. Is it possible that Naruto's sideline encouragement empowered Sakura, or is shonen anime plot armor to thank for coming to Sakura's rescue?  It's true that Sakura acknowledges and appreciates Naruto for his words of support in the episode immediately following her bout with Ino. That said, Sakura's victory over Ino's Mind Transfer technique is thanks to her own strength.

Tokyo 24th Ward is an exciting sci-fi shonen anime series from the Winter 2022 anime season, and it recently reached its thrilling conclusion in Episode 12, early in the spring 2022 season. Despite its short length, the story of Tokyo 24th Ward is an intriguing and thought-provoking one with densely-packed plot twists and revelations throughout.  This is the tale of Tokyo's troubled island ward, where the state surveillance system named Hazard Cast is causing no end of controversy as the ward government tightens its grip on the populace. It's up to protagonist Aoi Shuta and his friends Koki and Ran to save the day and prevent his island ward home from spiraling into cyberpunk-style anarchy and despair. What plot twists await Shuta in Tokyo 24th Ward? RELATED: Platinum End's 5 Most Shocking Plot Twists & How They Defined the Story          When Shuta, Koki & Ran Gained The Power Of Cipher                In the series' double-length premiere episode, the hero, Shuta Aoi, was wallowing in despair over failing to save his friend Suido Asumi in an elementary school fire when a brand-new disaster struck. Shuta's friend Mari was stuck on train tracks and was about to get run over, and Shuta saw those grisly events for himself when he and his friends gained the ability to see into the near future with Cipher. Most importantly, this \"Quirk\" was a gift from Asumi's digital ghost, and she asked her three friends to somehow save the future. This rebooted Shuta's failed career as an amateur hero, and he, Koki and Ran used their cyberpunk gifts to save Mari's life.          When The False Villain Carneades Appeared                After Shuta and his friends failed to save the day during their second superhero mission, the mysterious masked villain Carneades appeared on TV, claiming responsibility for the disaster at the GourFes event. However, this was a ruse. Carneades was actually Koki's ally Tsuzusagawa, who used this persona to hide the fact that the all-seeing KANAE system was glitching badly. Tsuzusagawa didn't want mayor Suido Gori to learn the truth, so she bought herself time with the Carneades character, and Shuta learned this for himself when he confronted her on the roof of the Cornucopia building one day -- although there was more to it than that.  RELATED: The Technology of Tokyo 24th Ward's Cyberpunk Future, Explained          When Shuta's Team Learned The Truth Of Asumi & KANAE                The KANAE surveillance system had a dire secret: the entire thing was run with the remains of Asumi herself, with her biological brain allowing the high-tech system to process incredible amounts of data and accurately predict the future. Mayor Suido himself knew this, but what he didn't know was that his daughter's conscience was still intact inside the system, meaning her transhumanist digital ghost could think for itself. Asumi was in agony, so Tsuzusagawa gave Shuta and Koki the mission to somehow put an end to this and save Asumi from her cyberpunk fate. The entire ward depended on it as the KANAE controversy worsened.          When Kunai Was Killed For His Role In Drug D & Attempted Terrorism                Mayor Suido wanted an excuse to increase his use of KANAE in Tokyo's 24th ward, so he had his associates exploit Ran's friend Koki, creating something known as \"Drug D.\" This was a warped version of Kunai's high-tech therapy system, and it tricked everyone into thinking a powerful drug was being spread across the ward. That would create the perfect excuse to tear down the ward's shantytown and replace it with a casino monitored by KANAE, and Kunai fought back by attempting to blow up a ship owned by the person who created Drug D -- a certain Howard Win. Then, SARG assassinated Kunai right before Ran's eyes, and that drove a deep wedge between the rebellious Ran and his government-supporting friend Koki.          When Suido Kanae Was Killed In A Flashback                Another major plot twist took place not in the present, but in the past. A flashback shed some light on how the KANAE system came to be, and it was all based on Suido Kanae and her associates. Kanae dreamed of a system that could help protect the people of the ward, but she died in a stabbing incident, and her grieving husband, future mayor Suido Gori, took action. He grew bitter and vowed to use technology to maintain order in the ward to honor his wife's memory, no matter how many lines were crossed. Eventually, when his daughter Asumi was all but dead after the fire, Gori used her body to complete the KANAE system and prevent such disasters from taking place in the ward ever again. However, this was never what Suido Kanae wanted.

By Michael Guterres Published 15 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduced plenty of exciting new characters, but it may be too early for one in particular.                  The following article contains spoilers for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, now playing in theaters.   Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sped into theaters last Friday to much excitement from fans. And it\u2019s easy to see why; between the introduction of Knuckles and Tails, the high-octane action and a bombastic finale, the film does a great job of upping the stakes and keeping fans on their toes. But the film's mid-credits scene was particularly noteworthy for its introduction of another fan-favorite character: Shadow the Hedgehog.  Shadow debuted in the 2001 game Sonic Adventure 2, which explored his history as the genetic experiment of Gerald Robotnik, the grandfather of Eggman. Since then, Shadow has served as one of Sonic\u2019s biggest rivals -- a dark mirror of the blue hedgehog with murkier morals and a more tragic past. He\u2019s also had ups and downs, between his own solo game, appearances in various cartoons and plenty of good and bad stories in the Archie and IDW comics. But despite him being a staple of the franchise for years, it may be too early to bring him into the movies. RELATED: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Outdid Spider-Man: No Way Home in One Massive Way                  The first thing to remember about Shadow\u2019s introduction is that it came a decade after Sonic\u2019s first game. That\u2019s ten years of developing Sonic as a character, introducing him to new friends and having him face off against deadly enemies. A status quo had been set by this point, especially for Sonic himself, and throwing Shadow into the mix did nothing but develop his character further and give him and his world a new direction to go. But the world of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies and the cast of characters inhabiting it have only just begun, and Shadow is a game-changer -- he can and will uproot everything fans know so far.  There\u2019s also the issue of Shadow\u2019s status as Sonic\u2019s rival, a role currently filled by Knuckles in the films. In a way, Knuckles was one of Sonic\u2019s first proper counterparts in the games. The two had similar motives, sure, but their differing personalities meant that the two clashed as often as they cooperated. And over time, that rivalry faded as the two underwent arcs that brought them closer together, leaving room for new rivals. But the films haven\u2019t had time for that yet; Sonic and Knuckles may be on the same side by the end of the film and may even be friends, but their personalities are still likely to be a source of conflict in the future. And by introducing Shadow so soon, the films run the risk of brushing Knuckles to the wayside, which, given how positive fan reactions have been to the character, seems like a poor decision.  RELATED: Sonic 2 Runs Circles Around the Original With Colorful Chaos                 And on top of all that, there's still the question of how the introduction of Shadow can naturally build upon the events of the previous two films. The first movie introduced the idea of Sonic and Eggman\u2019s rivalry, ending with Sonic beginning to find a new family while Eggman descended into madness. The second film built more on those ideas, introducing new characters, diving deep into Robotnik\u2019s hatred of Sonic and worldbuilding through concepts like the Chaos Emeralds and Master Emerald. In fairness, the Emeralds are used prolifically in Shadow\u2019s debut game. And though not the main focus of Eggman\u2019s plan, which is to take over the world, his hatred of Sonic does shine through at various points. But the plot of Adventure 2 is a change to the status quo -- it doesn\u2019t just build upon what\u2019s come before, it changes it. But the films haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet, leaving Shadow\u2019s introduction and main story feeling premature. If there\u2019s one thing the Sonic the Hedgehog movies are good at, it\u2019s making the game characters compelling and well-written. They\u2019ll likely do the same with Shadow, but they still run the risk of introducing him before it's time, which could easily derail the story they\u2019ve been trying to tell.  To see Shadow's film debut, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now playing in theaters.                   Sonic 2 Director Addresses the Potential of a Super Smash Bros.

Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Is It Too Early for [SPOILER]?  By Michael Guterres Published 15 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sonic the Hedgehog 2 introduced plenty of exciting new characters, but it may be too early for one in particular.                  The following article contains spoilers for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, now playing in theaters.   Sonic the Hedgehog 2 sped into theaters last Friday to much excitement from fans. And it\u2019s easy to see why; between the introduction of Knuckles and Tails, the high-octane action and a bombastic finale, the film does a great job of upping the stakes and keeping fans on their toes. But the film's mid-credits scene was particularly noteworthy for its introduction of another fan-favorite character: Shadow the Hedgehog.  Shadow debuted in the 2001 game Sonic Adventure 2, which explored his history as the genetic experiment of Gerald Robotnik, the grandfather of Eggman. Since then, Shadow has served as one of Sonic\u2019s biggest rivals -- a dark mirror of the blue hedgehog with murkier morals and a more tragic past. He\u2019s also had ups and downs, between his own solo game, appearances in various cartoons and plenty of good and bad stories in the Archie and IDW comics. But despite him being a staple of the franchise for years, it may be too early to bring him into the movies. RELATED: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Outdid Spider-Man: No Way Home in One Massive Way                  The first thing to remember about Shadow\u2019s introduction is that it came a decade after Sonic\u2019s first game. That\u2019s ten years of developing Sonic as a character, introducing him to new friends and having him face off against deadly enemies. A status quo had been set by this point, especially for Sonic himself, and throwing Shadow into the mix did nothing but develop his character further and give him and his world a new direction to go. But the world of the Sonic the Hedgehog movies and the cast of characters inhabiting it have only just begun, and Shadow is a game-changer -- he can and will uproot everything fans know so far.  There\u2019s also the issue of Shadow\u2019s status as Sonic\u2019s rival, a role currently filled by Knuckles in the films. In a way, Knuckles was one of Sonic\u2019s first proper counterparts in the games. The two had similar motives, sure, but their differing personalities meant that the two clashed as often as they cooperated. And over time, that rivalry faded as the two underwent arcs that brought them closer together, leaving room for new rivals. But the films haven\u2019t had time for that yet; Sonic and Knuckles may be on the same side by the end of the film and may even be friends, but their personalities are still likely to be a source of conflict in the future. And by introducing Shadow so soon, the films run the risk of brushing Knuckles to the wayside, which, given how positive fan reactions have been to the character, seems like a poor decision.  RELATED: Sonic 2 Runs Circles Around the Original With Colorful Chaos                 And on top of all that, there's still the question of how the introduction of Shadow can naturally build upon the events of the previous two films. The first movie introduced the idea of Sonic and Eggman\u2019s rivalry, ending with Sonic beginning to find a new family while Eggman descended into madness. The second film built more on those ideas, introducing new characters, diving deep into Robotnik\u2019s hatred of Sonic and worldbuilding through concepts like the Chaos Emeralds and Master Emerald. In fairness, the Emeralds are used prolifically in Shadow\u2019s debut game. And though not the main focus of Eggman\u2019s plan, which is to take over the world, his hatred of Sonic does shine through at various points. But the plot of Adventure 2 is a change to the status quo -- it doesn\u2019t just build upon what\u2019s come before, it changes it. But the films haven\u2019t gotten to that point yet, leaving Shadow\u2019s introduction and main story feeling premature. If there\u2019s one thing the Sonic the Hedgehog movies are good at, it\u2019s making the game characters compelling and well-written. They\u2019ll likely do the same with Shadow, but they still run the risk of introducing him before it's time, which could easily derail the story they\u2019ve been trying to tell.  To see Shadow's film debut, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is now playing in theaters.                   Sonic 2 Director Addresses the Potential of a Super Smash Bros.

Heroines Run the Show has just begun airing as part of the packed Spring 2022 anime season, but believe it or not, it's the latest installment of a much bigger universe. So big, in fact, that it's been around for more than ten years.  Here's a quick run-down of the world spun by Honeyworks, and how newcomers and veteran fans alike can get started with each area of the sprawling anime, manga and music franchise. RELATED: Pok\u00e9mon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media          Who and What Is Honeyworks?                 Honeyworks is an independent music circle comprised three core members: the composers Gom and Shito and their illustrator, Yamako. They got their start by producing music through the popular vocal synthesizing software, VOCALOID. They first started producing music in 2010 and released their first full album in 2011.  In 2014, the trio collaborated with the singer CHICO and formed the new unit CHICO with Honeyworks. They would go on to perform several opening and ending themes for a number of popular anime, including Haikyuu!!, Gintama and Magic Kaito. RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre          Honeyworks' Connection to Famous Anime Voice Actors - and Hatsune Miku                Honeyworks have released numerous music videos since their debut, but their best-known works are part of a large, ongoing continuity titled Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The series details the love lives of several different teenagers who all happen to attend the same high school. It brings focus to different kinds of love: romantic, platonic and even unrequited. The core cast consists of six characters: Miou, Haruki, Natsuki, Yuu, Souta and Akari, as they stumble through awkward confessions and first dates up to their graduation ceremony.  There is a proper order to watch the videos, and they can all be viewed for free on Honeyworks' official YouTube channel. Be warned, however: not all of the available videos have English subtitles. All the main characters have at least one song centered on them, starting with Love's Picture Book. The songs were initially performed by virtual singers, including GUMI, Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Len and vFlower. As the series gained more popularity, Honeyworks eventually switched to using human singers more often, managing to get well-known talents in the voice acting industry like Yuki Kaji, Haruka Toumatsu and Natsuki Hanae.  Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~ is both a spin-off and a sequel that takes place roughly a year after the cast of Love Series have graduated. It focuses on several up-and-coming idols as they juggle celebrity life with their own personal drama and a dash of romance. Characters from the Love Series make frequent appearances and while knowledge of their origins is recommended, it isn't necessary to fully enjoy this follow-up. Unlike its predecessor, there isn't a very clear starting point for the ~Idol Series~ music videos. While it's generally recommended to start with LIPxLIP's Romeo, most of the songs can be watched in any order.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Where to Watch & Read Honeyworks' Anime & Manga Adaptations                There have been two film adaptations and an eight-episode anime based on Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The first two films, I've Always Liked You and The Moment You Fall in Love, can be watched in release order followed by the anime, Our Love Has Always Been 10 Centimeters Apart. While the anime is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, both films were removed from the Crunchyroll library in May 2021 and are currently unavailable for streaming or purchase.  As for the Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~, there has been a film adaptation that focuses on the idol unit LIPxLIP titled Kono Sekai no Tanoshimikata: Secret Story Film (How to Enjoy This World: Secret Story Film). The film has yet to be picked up for streaming by any platforms. Finally, the latest anime adaptation that started airing this Spring, Heroines Run the Show, acts as a direct sequel to the film and focuses on the idol unit's manager, the plucky country girl Hiyori. It is currently available for streaming on Crunchyroll. RELATED: What Music-Inspired Anime to Watch After takt op.Destiny                 In addition to all the anime adaptations, there have also been a number of novel and manga series, some either acting as direct adaptations of the source material or chronicling entirely new side stories. There are even a number of audio drama CDs, albums featuring all-new music performed by the anime's cast, and a mobile phone game that's still currently in service. Unfortunately, none of these supplemental materials have been officially licensed and translated outside of Japan. But possibly the most impressive piece of official media to have come out of this franchise would be the live concerts. The idol units created by Honeyworks appear on stage and perform via hologram projection, not unlike a typical Hatsune Miku concert.  Honeyworks has created a lovable shojo universe that seems to be growing bigger every year. There's a lot to dig into here, and this is just scratching the surface. But if one has the time and an insatiable hankering for something sweet and fluffy, then by all means, dig deeper.

So big, in fact, that it's been around for more than ten years.  Here's a quick run-down of the world spun by Honeyworks, and how newcomers and veteran fans alike can get started with each area of the sprawling anime, manga and music franchise. RELATED: Pok\u00e9mon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media          Who and What Is Honeyworks?                 Honeyworks is an independent music circle comprised three core members: the composers Gom and Shito and their illustrator, Yamako. They got their start by producing music through the popular vocal synthesizing software, VOCALOID. They first started producing music in 2010 and released their first full album in 2011.  In 2014, the trio collaborated with the singer CHICO and formed the new unit CHICO with Honeyworks. They would go on to perform several opening and ending themes for a number of popular anime, including Haikyuu!!, Gintama and Magic Kaito. RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre          Honeyworks' Connection to Famous Anime Voice Actors - and Hatsune Miku                Honeyworks have released numerous music videos since their debut, but their best-known works are part of a large, ongoing continuity titled Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The series details the love lives of several different teenagers who all happen to attend the same high school. It brings focus to different kinds of love: romantic, platonic and even unrequited. The core cast consists of six characters: Miou, Haruki, Natsuki, Yuu, Souta and Akari, as they stumble through awkward confessions and first dates up to their graduation ceremony.  There is a proper order to watch the videos, and they can all be viewed for free on Honeyworks' official YouTube channel. Be warned, however: not all of the available videos have English subtitles. All the main characters have at least one song centered on them, starting with Love's Picture Book. The songs were initially performed by virtual singers, including GUMI, Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Len and vFlower. As the series gained more popularity, Honeyworks eventually switched to using human singers more often, managing to get well-known talents in the voice acting industry like Yuki Kaji, Haruka Toumatsu and Natsuki Hanae.  Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~ is both a spin-off and a sequel that takes place roughly a year after the cast of Love Series have graduated. It focuses on several up-and-coming idols as they juggle celebrity life with their own personal drama and a dash of romance. Characters from the Love Series make frequent appearances and while knowledge of their origins is recommended, it isn't necessary to fully enjoy this follow-up. Unlike its predecessor, there isn't a very clear starting point for the ~Idol Series~ music videos. While it's generally recommended to start with LIPxLIP's Romeo, most of the songs can be watched in any order.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Where to Watch & Read Honeyworks' Anime & Manga Adaptations                There have been two film adaptations and an eight-episode anime based on Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The first two films, I've Always Liked You and The Moment You Fall in Love, can be watched in release order followed by the anime, Our Love Has Always Been 10 Centimeters Apart. While the anime is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, both films were removed from the Crunchyroll library in May 2021 and are currently unavailable for streaming or purchase.  As for the Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~, there has been a film adaptation that focuses on the idol unit LIPxLIP titled Kono Sekai no Tanoshimikata: Secret Story Film (How to Enjoy This World: Secret Story Film). The film has yet to be picked up for streaming by any platforms. Finally, the latest anime adaptation that started airing this Spring, Heroines Run the Show, acts as a direct sequel to the film and focuses on the idol unit's manager, the plucky country girl Hiyori. It is currently available for streaming on Crunchyroll. RELATED: What Music-Inspired Anime to Watch After takt op.Destiny                 In addition to all the anime adaptations, there have also been a number of novel and manga series, some either acting as direct adaptations of the source material or chronicling entirely new side stories. There are even a number of audio drama CDs, albums featuring all-new music performed by the anime's cast, and a mobile phone game that's still currently in service. Unfortunately, none of these supplemental materials have been officially licensed and translated outside of Japan. But possibly the most impressive piece of official media to have come out of this franchise would be the live concerts. The idol units created by Honeyworks appear on stage and perform via hologram projection, not unlike a typical Hatsune Miku concert.  Honeyworks has created a lovable shojo universe that seems to be growing bigger every year. There's a lot to dig into here, and this is just scratching the surface. But if one has the time and an insatiable hankering for something sweet and fluffy, then by all means, dig deeper.

The Rising of the Shield Hero is a popular isekai anime series that recently returned in the Spring 2022 anime season for more adventures in the faraway Melromarc kingdom. By now, protagonist Iwatani Naofumi has formed an excellent party of adventurers to aid him, but eventually, they will have to say goodbye.  Since the beginning, Shield Hero has upturned one of isekai's core elements: the one-way trip. Heroes such as Rimuru Tempest and Ainz Ooal Gown have no hope of returning home, but once the Waves are over, Naofumi and the other Cardinal Heroes will be sent back home, never to return. And Naofumi's best friend, Raphtalia, isn't ready for this at all. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          Why Raphtalia Must Learn To Say Goodbye                Naofumi's first party member in Shield Hero is the tanuki demi-human Raphtalia, whom he bought as a slave before appointing her as his party's main sword fighter. Soon, they formed a foster father/daughter dynamic, with each of them trusting and relying heavily on the other, even when the other party members such as Filo and princess Melty were added to the mix. Raphtalia is personally attached to Naofumi in the story of Shield Hero, but she is also aware that eventually, all four Cardinal Heroes will be sent back to Earth, never to return, and she is not prepared for this to happen.  Raphtalia is somewhat co-dependent on Naofumi, as he is the first person outside her home village to treat her well and value her. Naofumi gave Raphtalia a new purpose as a powerful warrior who can defend the innocent against the Waves, and Naofumi personally cares for all of Raphtalia's needs without hesitation. Naturally, this made Raphtalia strongly attached to him, and she panics slightly and is almost reduced to tears at the thought of them being forced apart in the future. Raphtalia does have the rebuilt Lurolona Village to appreciate, along with all its inhabitants, but Naofumi is another matter entirely. If Raphtalia doesn't want to totally break down when Naofumi is forced to leave, she must learn to form stronger bonds with her fellow natives and begin acting and thinking independently. For her own sake, she must gradually phase Naofumi out of her mind and replace him with her fellow villagers, Filo, princess Melty and the like, and make them the most important people in her heart instead.  Fortunately for Raphtalia, all those characters are equally fond of her and are worth Raphtalia's affection. They should provide a strong emotional cushion for Raphtalia when Naofumi returns to Earth, and Raphtalia could find the mental strength necessary to bid him farewell and move on without him. Even when Naofumi is gone, Lurolona and its demi-human denizens will remain, and they will need Raphtalia and vice versa. Naofumi must be Raphtalia's role model and inspiration, not her lover or perpetual guardian. Naofumi helped Raphtalia regain her freedom and encouraged her to face her painful past. Now she must honor Naofumi's gifts by learning how to live a post-Naofumi life when the time is right.  RELATED: Konosuba's Kazuma Vs Shield Hero's Naofumi: Who's the Unluckiest Isekai Hero?          What This Means For The Isekai Genre                This subplot in the story of Shield Hero has intriguing implications not just for Shield Hero itself but the subgenre of isekai as a whole. While isekai is not a formal literary genre, it is a well-established subgenre with some core rules to it ever since the early days of Sword Art Online, such as the main character having slim to no chance of returning home; often, the hero previously died or was summoned by magic to end up in the new world. It's not an absolute law that an isekai hero must remain trapped in this new world forever, but that is the norm, and perhaps some anime fans are getting tired of it. This often leads to abstract, open-ended stories where there is no real end goal, since the hero cannot return home under their own power, and such stories end up becoming typical power fantasies as a result.  That's where Shield Hero comes in, where the hero actually can return home under the right circumstances, and that gives him an end goal. He must survive and fight not just to defend the innocent but also to return home at last, and that gives Shield Hero a sense of direction. Most of all, this plot twist creates palpable personal stakes for Raphtalia and Naofumi, as Naofumi's eventual return home will drive them apart, and they must be prepared to say goodbye. Just the idea of that is heart-wrenching, and it sets an example that future isekai series could stand to follow.

The Rising of the Shield Hero is a popular isekai anime series that recently returned in the Spring 2022 anime season for more adventures in the faraway Melromarc kingdom. By now, protagonist Iwatani Naofumi has formed an excellent party of adventurers to aid him, but eventually, they will have to say goodbye.  Since the beginning, Shield Hero has upturned one of isekai's core elements: the one-way trip. Heroes such as Rimuru Tempest and Ainz Ooal Gown have no hope of returning home, but once the Waves are over, Naofumi and the other Cardinal Heroes will be sent back home, never to return. And Naofumi's best friend, Raphtalia, isn't ready for this at all. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          Why Raphtalia Must Learn To Say Goodbye                Naofumi's first party member in Shield Hero is the tanuki demi-human Raphtalia, whom he bought as a slave before appointing her as his party's main sword fighter. Soon, they formed a foster father/daughter dynamic, with each of them trusting and relying heavily on the other, even when the other party members such as Filo and princess Melty were added to the mix. Raphtalia is personally attached to Naofumi in the story of Shield Hero, but she is also aware that eventually, all four Cardinal Heroes will be sent back to Earth, never to return, and she is not prepared for this to happen.  Raphtalia is somewhat co-dependent on Naofumi, as he is the first person outside her home village to treat her well and value her. Naofumi gave Raphtalia a new purpose as a powerful warrior who can defend the innocent against the Waves, and Naofumi personally cares for all of Raphtalia's needs without hesitation. Naturally, this made Raphtalia strongly attached to him, and she panics slightly and is almost reduced to tears at the thought of them being forced apart in the future. Raphtalia does have the rebuilt Lurolona Village to appreciate, along with all its inhabitants, but Naofumi is another matter entirely. If Raphtalia doesn't want to totally break down when Naofumi is forced to leave, she must learn to form stronger bonds with her fellow natives and begin acting and thinking independently. For her own sake, she must gradually phase Naofumi out of her mind and replace him with her fellow villagers, Filo, princess Melty and the like, and make them the most important people in her heart instead.  Fortunately for Raphtalia, all those characters are equally fond of her and are worth Raphtalia's affection. They should provide a strong emotional cushion for Raphtalia when Naofumi returns to Earth, and Raphtalia could find the mental strength necessary to bid him farewell and move on without him. Even when Naofumi is gone, Lurolona and its demi-human denizens will remain, and they will need Raphtalia and vice versa. Naofumi must be Raphtalia's role model and inspiration, not her lover or perpetual guardian. Naofumi helped Raphtalia regain her freedom and encouraged her to face her painful past. Now she must honor Naofumi's gifts by learning how to live a post-Naofumi life when the time is right.  RELATED: Konosuba's Kazuma Vs Shield Hero's Naofumi: Who's the Unluckiest Isekai Hero?          What This Means For The Isekai Genre                This subplot in the story of Shield Hero has intriguing implications not just for Shield Hero itself but the subgenre of isekai as a whole. While isekai is not a formal literary genre, it is a well-established subgenre with some core rules to it ever since the early days of Sword Art Online, such as the main character having slim to no chance of returning home; often, the hero previously died or was summoned by magic to end up in the new world. It's not an absolute law that an isekai hero must remain trapped in this new world forever, but that is the norm, and perhaps some anime fans are getting tired of it. This often leads to abstract, open-ended stories where there is no real end goal, since the hero cannot return home under their own power, and such stories end up becoming typical power fantasies as a result.  That's where Shield Hero comes in, where the hero actually can return home under the right circumstances, and that gives him an end goal. He must survive and fight not just to defend the innocent but also to return home at last, and that gives Shield Hero a sense of direction. Most of all, this plot twist creates palpable personal stakes for Raphtalia and Naofumi, as Naofumi's eventual return home will drive them apart, and they must be prepared to say goodbye. Just the idea of that is heart-wrenching, and it sets an example that future isekai series could stand to follow.

Critical Role's Exandria Unlimited mini-campaign introduced fans to a whole new cast of player characters. It also brought an intriguing new Dungeon Master, Aabria Iyengar, with a completely different style than the Dungeons & Dragons play show's main DM, Matthew Mercer. Then, when EU regular Robbie Daymond was present for several episodes at the start of Critical Role's third campaign, fans weren't sure if he would become a permanent regular.  However, circumstances within the story eventually led to Daymond's Air Genasi Bard, Dorian Storm, fleeing the continent of Marquet in an airship with his fugitive brother, Cyrus. Returning to Tal'dorei, Dorian called out to old friends, the Crown Keepers, to help him find a way to pay his brother's massive bounty. At the end of the episode when Dorian and Cyrus left, Critical Role reassured fans that this would not be the last they saw of Daymond by announcing a special two-part episode of Exandria Unlimited titled \"Kymal.\" Related: D&D's Call of the Netherdeep Shows How Rivals Can Improve the Game                 This announcement left fans to wonder how many other loose threads might be tugged in Kymal. One of the largest bits of unfinished business was the first major enemy the Crown Keepers made in Emon: Poska and the Nameless Ones. After stealing the Spider Queen's crown from Poska, the party fled from the city and embarked on their journey knowing the Nameless Ones would pursue. Not long after arriving in Kymal, they discovered the unaffiliated thieves guild was there as well, and they were doing everything in their power to take over the lawless casino town. Anjali Bhimani's Fire Genasi Monk, Fy'ra Rai, had initially left the group to search for her missing twin sister, Fy'ra Kai, but she heeded the call and returned to offer her aid to Dorian's cause. Her search for Fy'ra Kai seemed to be fruitless, but it wasn't long before she discovered her twin was there in Kymal -- and working with the Nameless Ones. This was just one of many important plot points from the initial mini-campaign that Kymal expanded upon, but when all was said and done, the thread was left wide open for future exploration.  Related: Why Poison Is Dungeons & Dragons' Worst Damage Type Additionally, Aimee Carrero's Warlock, Opal, had fully utilized the Spider Queen's Vestige of Divergence. The crown had obviously corrupted her in ways the old Opal would never stand for, but the power it offered was too enticing to refuse. The constant whispers of the Spider Queen now regularly accompanied those of Opal's Warlock patron, her twin sister Ted, whom the party actually fought in the final episode of the original mini-campaign.                As the party began plotting a heist to get their hands on the outrageous sum needed to clear Cyrus, they encountered a new ally. Morrighan Ferus, played by voice actress Erica Lindbeck, was a mysterious Lagomore (humanoid bunny) from the Feywild, tending bar in Kymal. Overhearing their bumbling plot to steal from the casino vault, accomplished thief Morrighan offered her services and joined the party in an effort to satisfy the mysterious voice in her head driving her to flee Kymal.  RELATED: D&D: Call of the Netherdeep's Ruidium Is an Incredible Role-Playing Tool Before all was said and done, the Crown Keepers managed to successfully pull off their heist and get away from the casino on a floating bar deck powered by broomstone. In the final moments, Fy'ra Rai made eye contact with her sister from a distance, affirming that there is definitely unfinished business the party will need to address in future episodes, including a major face to face with the Nameless Ones. Beyond that, Morrighan's strange ties to the Raven Queen suggest the Crown Keepers may need to help their new friend on her own quest. Dorian and Cyrus also have the means to clear Cyrus' bounty in Marquet, but first the party needs to figure out how to move their broomstone-powered craft as far from Kymal as possible before they land and make away with their loot, meaning there are once again plenty of plotlines left wide open for a future return to Exandria Unllimited.

Home Anime Tokyo 24th Ward's Finale Is Saved With the Power of Friendship    Tokyo 24th Ward's Finale Is Saved With the Power of Friendship  By Louis Kemner Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In Tokyo 24th Ward's finale, shonen's power of friendship triumphs over the chaos of technology.                  The following contains spoilers for Episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward, \"Youth 24th Ward,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The bitter controversy over the oppressive KANAE surveillance system comes to a head in the final episode of Tokyo 24th Ward, when Shuta and his two friends reunite as the RBG squad to save the day once again as homegrown heroes. This is the mission that Shuta inherited from Chikushi, and he must see it through to the end for the entire ward's sake.  Most of all, Shuta must complete this mission for Suido Asumi's sake, with her being trapped inside the KANAE system as a transhumanist AI who suffers constant torment in the digital world. Asumi is convinced that the pain of paying the price for choosing a new future is too great to bear, but Shuta, Koki and Ran feel differently. They have shonen's power of friendship on their side. RELATED: Haikyuu!!'s Uplifting Ending, Explained                Episode 12 picks up right where Episode 11 left off, with Shuta, Koki and Ran reconciling their bitter differences to save their island ward home one last time as heroes gifted with the power of Cipher in their eyes. The three boys receive one last \"trolley dilemma\" scenario from Asumi via their superpowers, and they must choose to either expose KANAE's secrets and have the system shut down, or else use a module to rewrite it and have Asumi's transhumanist mind go to peaceful \"sleep\" in the system forever.  Either way, Asumi will be lost, but that is what she wants. Existing in this digital transhumanist state is agony for her, to the point where she glitches constantly. This is what prompted Tsuzusagawa to pose as \"Carneades\" the villain to explain KANAE's strange predictions, but now, a more permanent solution must be found. Shuta must make his most difficult decision of all. RELATED: Shield Hero: Naofumi Explores an Exotic New Kingdom in Season 2's Premiere                Shuta and his friends believe in the power of friendship, and they use it to meet Asumi directly, even though Asumi doesn't want to speak with them. In Asumi's mind, the sacrifices necessary to obtain a desired future are too much to bear, and compromise is impossible. By contrast, Shuta and his friends use both the power of friendship and faith in the future to face this dilemma anyway and make the right choice, even if they can't \"cheat\" and have things both ways to create a foolproof scenario. The boys understand that paying opportunity costs is a fact of life, and they have the courage to pay those costs if it means taking a chance on a better future.  No one, not even the RGB boys, can ever guarantee that their risky decisions will pay off and create the future that they want, but that isn't a problem for them, especially with the power of friendship on their side. To them, gambling on dilemmas and paying opportunity costs is simply proof that they are alive and in control of their lives, and that makes them happy. Asumi accepts this solution and bids her three friends a fond farewell, this time without any anguish or regrets. She fades away, and the KANAE system is shut down by a grieving Mayor Suido. The episode's falling action explains how the people of the 24th ward will take their future into their own hands without the need for all-seeing state surveillance systems, which ends the ward's current conflict peacefully. This also means that the entire ward's population can echo RBG's power of friendship and faith in the future, and everyone can step toward this future with confidence. The ward is more than its buildings or high-tech computers -- it's the people, and those people can be trusted with their own future. On that note, the cyberpunk story of Tokyo 24th Ward comes to a close.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 12 of Tokyo 24th Ward, \"Youth 24th Ward,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The bitter controversy over the oppressive KANAE surveillance system comes to a head in the final episode of Tokyo 24th Ward, when Shuta and his two friends reunite as the RBG squad to save the day once again as homegrown heroes. This is the mission that Shuta inherited from Chikushi, and he must see it through to the end for the entire ward's sake.  Most of all, Shuta must complete this mission for Suido Asumi's sake, with her being trapped inside the KANAE system as a transhumanist AI who suffers constant torment in the digital world. Asumi is convinced that the pain of paying the price for choosing a new future is too great to bear, but Shuta, Koki and Ran feel differently. They have shonen's power of friendship on their side. RELATED: Haikyuu!!'s Uplifting Ending, Explained                Episode 12 picks up right where Episode 11 left off, with Shuta, Koki and Ran reconciling their bitter differences to save their island ward home one last time as heroes gifted with the power of Cipher in their eyes. The three boys receive one last \"trolley dilemma\" scenario from Asumi via their superpowers, and they must choose to either expose KANAE's secrets and have the system shut down, or else use a module to rewrite it and have Asumi's transhumanist mind go to peaceful \"sleep\" in the system forever.  Either way, Asumi will be lost, but that is what she wants. Existing in this digital transhumanist state is agony for her, to the point where she glitches constantly. This is what prompted Tsuzusagawa to pose as \"Carneades\" the villain to explain KANAE's strange predictions, but now, a more permanent solution must be found. Shuta must make his most difficult decision of all. RELATED: Shield Hero: Naofumi Explores an Exotic New Kingdom in Season 2's Premiere                Shuta and his friends believe in the power of friendship, and they use it to meet Asumi directly, even though Asumi doesn't want to speak with them. In Asumi's mind, the sacrifices necessary to obtain a desired future are too much to bear, and compromise is impossible. By contrast, Shuta and his friends use both the power of friendship and faith in the future to face this dilemma anyway and make the right choice, even if they can't \"cheat\" and have things both ways to create a foolproof scenario. The boys understand that paying opportunity costs is a fact of life, and they have the courage to pay those costs if it means taking a chance on a better future.  No one, not even the RGB boys, can ever guarantee that their risky decisions will pay off and create the future that they want, but that isn't a problem for them, especially with the power of friendship on their side. To them, gambling on dilemmas and paying opportunity costs is simply proof that they are alive and in control of their lives, and that makes them happy. Asumi accepts this solution and bids her three friends a fond farewell, this time without any anguish or regrets. She fades away, and the KANAE system is shut down by a grieving Mayor Suido. The episode's falling action explains how the people of the 24th ward will take their future into their own hands without the need for all-seeing state surveillance systems, which ends the ward's current conflict peacefully. This also means that the entire ward's population can echo RBG's power of friendship and faith in the future, and everyone can step toward this future with confidence. The ward is more than its buildings or high-tech computers -- it's the people, and those people can be trusted with their own future. On that note, the cyberpunk story of Tokyo 24th Ward comes to a close.

The following contains spoilers for Requiem of the Rose King, now streaming on Funimation, as well as discussion of sexual assault.   Censorship isn't anything new in the anime industry, especially when it comes to violence. Viewers have seen it happen in anime like Tokyo Ghoul with the censorship of Kaneki's torture scene, but other anime such as Attack on Titan have never shied away from showing gory scenes. However, Requiem of the Rose King, which likewise has its fair share of violent fight scenes (how could it not when it's set during the War of the Roses?) has been heavily censored to the point where there's hardly any animated movement at all. The anime tries to hide it by using color palettes that make scenes look intentionally artistic but it gets distracting.  Requiem of the Rose King is already breaking a lot of barriers with its concept. Rarely do viewers get to see an intersex character as the protagonist, and the anime could have started some important conversations around topics such as sexual violence while focusing on the LGBTQ+ community. Again, censorship between same-sex couples is familiar territory in anime and is often heavily implied, such as with the kiss scene in Yuri!!! on Ice. However, Requiem of the Rose King's treatment is blatantly disrespectful because the story is about Richard. By censoring his struggles with his body, the core of the story is lost.  RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King: Richard's Confession Ends in Heartbreaking Tragedy          The Kiss Scenes                 Richard's love for his father has always been apparent from the beginning. While his mother rejected him, his father had always been obvious in his unconditional support and love for his youngest son. Taunted by Margaret's lies about Richard's death, his father was killed and his head put on a stake for display. When at last Richard found his father, he kissed his head. While it's clear that this scene was censored due to its incestuous nature, plot-wise, this was also the turning point for Richard. Having been demonized and separated from the rest of his family by his mother, this moment with his father was for him alone.  In the last episode, Richard wavers between his love and hatred for Henry. At last, he decides to give him one last chance to accept him for who he is with both male and female body parts. For a split second, it looked as though he and Henry's story would have a happy ending as the two embrace, but the anime doesn't even show this. What's intended as an emotionally moving moment with the two finally giving in to their feelings and lust, made even more intense because both of them had their own personal reservations, was barely shown. The background had a kaleidoscope effect and when the two kissed, they turned into black silhouettes. Richard's knife blocked the viewers from seeing their lips touch.  However, when it came to Richard's kiss with Anne, that wasn't censored at all. The preference is clear as to what is 'appropriate' and what is deemed 'inappropriate.' Granted, at that time, same-sex relationships were looked down, but in this era and with the source material focusing on the LGBTQ+ community, it's disappointing that the studio took this route, as it unfortunately reinforces hetereonormative roles. By not censoring Richard's kiss with Anne, the adaptation affirms his gender identity as a man but discredits his feelings for men, thus reinforcing gender stereotypes and traditional societal norms.  RELATED: Why This Popular K-Drama Is an Error-Free BL Webtoon Adaptation          Portrayals of Sexual Violence                 Two key scenes have been understandably but heavily censored. The first is Richard's near sexual assault in Episode 2. He gets captured by a group of men when he was disguising himself as a woman, and his attacker only stops when he sees Richard's breasts. He flees, terrified. The second scene is Henry's sexual assault by Margaret, which is only hinted at in the anime. Henry's trauma from that event as well as bearing witness to his mother's infidelity are the reasons why he has repressed all of his desires and urges.  Sexual violence committed against men may not be as prevalent as that against women, but it still exists. Domestic violence is already underreported for both men and women, but when the victims are men, it's often even more so. The effects of what Henry has endured are shown clearly in his reactions to Richard, but this scene is glossed over and glimpsed only in quick flashes. Including a scene that focuses on Henry's emotional and physical abuse at the hands of his wife would have opened up a dialogue around domestic violence against men. Similarly, Richard's experience could have started conversations around abuse against the LGBTQ+ community. Requiem of the Rose King has been deliberate and open about highlighting the struggles of this community, yet as soon as it comes to more serious topics like assault that are a reality for many in the community, it goes silent.  Related: 5 Boys Love Anime With Actual Healthy Relationships          Richard's Body                 Requiem of the Rose King is treading a very fine and frankly disappointing line of representing intersex characters. As mentioned, the anime doesn't shy away from portraying Richard's hatred and conflict around his body having both female and male body parts. Sometimes, it can even be overwhelming with how internalized Richard's self-demonization is that it's so pervasive throughout the anime. It's undeniable that Requiem of the Rose King isn't so much a celebration of the LGBTQ community as much as it shows the sufferings of those who do not conform to gender binaries. However, it's interesting that even though there's an obsession with Richard's body, the viewers can't actually see Richard's body.  It can be argued that because Richard has breasts, the anime chooses to censor his body, but the way in which this has been done has erased any representation of intersex bodies. It feels like the adaptation is skirting around the major themes of Requiem of the Rose King, which is difficult to reconcile with the title since the entire story has always been about Richard's feelings toward his body. It's why he feels that he can never be king and why he's unlovable. If the studio had been forward in its animation of Richard's body, it could have stirred an important wave in the conversation around acceptance. As a result, it's extremely difficult to celebrate the anime adaptation when it has done such a disservice to the LGBTQ community.

The following contains spoilers for Requiem of the Rose King, now streaming on Funimation, as well as discussion of sexual assault.   Censorship isn't anything new in the anime industry, especially when it comes to violence. Viewers have seen it happen in anime like Tokyo Ghoul with the censorship of Kaneki's torture scene, but other anime such as Attack on Titan have never shied away from showing gory scenes. However, Requiem of the Rose King, which likewise has its fair share of violent fight scenes (how could it not when it's set during the War of the Roses?) has been heavily censored to the point where there's hardly any animated movement at all. The anime tries to hide it by using color palettes that make scenes look intentionally artistic but it gets distracting.  Requiem of the Rose King is already breaking a lot of barriers with its concept. Rarely do viewers get to see an intersex character as the protagonist, and the anime could have started some important conversations around topics such as sexual violence while focusing on the LGBTQ+ community. Again, censorship between same-sex couples is familiar territory in anime and is often heavily implied, such as with the kiss scene in Yuri!!! on Ice. However, Requiem of the Rose King's treatment is blatantly disrespectful because the story is about Richard. By censoring his struggles with his body, the core of the story is lost.  RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King: Richard's Confession Ends in Heartbreaking Tragedy          The Kiss Scenes                 Richard's love for his father has always been apparent from the beginning.

Jujutsu Kaisen revealed a new collaboration the stop-motion series Pui Pui Molcar.  What started out as an April Fool's joke has now become a legitimate collaboration. The official Jujutsu Kaisen Twitter account announced that the series will cross over with the popular stop-motion animated series Pui Pui Molcar and revealed new art, which features the cast of Gege Akutami's dark-fantasy shonen series being paired up with their own hybrid guinea pigs/cars. The art work will appear on special merchandise, which will be released at a later date. The collaboration's official website also teases further announcements related to the crossover. RELATED: How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche          On April 1, Jujutsu Kaisen tweeted out an image of Masamichi Yaga, which was edited to look like he was holding Potato, the main character from Pui Pui Molcar. Yaga is the principal of Tokyo's Jujutsu High School, and possesses the ability to bring dolls to life with his special Cursed ability. Despite his intimidating appearance and demeanor, he frequently displays a preference for cute things, such as stuffed animals, which is probably the reason why he was the character who was picked to introduce the series' Molcar collaboration. Pui Pui Molcar premiered in Japan in early 2021 and is distributed internationally by Netflix. The series takes place in a world where humans drive sentient vehicles that resemble guinea pigs but have car-like qualities, such as wheels and doors. While intended for younger demographics, the series was a hit with fans of all ages, with praise going towards its adorably designed characters and simple humor. The 12-episode series was followed up with the release of a movie, entitled Tobidase! Narase! Pui Pui Molcar, which was released in Japan last July.  RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tops $30 Million, Leading Actors to Reveal Shockingly Low Pay Rates Jujutsu Kaisen, meanwhile, continues to be one of Japan's biggest anime and manga franchises. Gege Akutami's gritty work about the battle between sorcerers and cursed spirits was the best-selling manga of 2021, narrowly edging out Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba. The series first movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0, premiered in Japan last December, where it quickly became the highest-grossing film for 2021 in the region. The movie was released in North America last March, where it earned an addition $30 million USD. The movie has now pulled in over $180 million USD worldwide, making it one of the ten highest-grossing anime movies ever made. A second season of the anime series is scheduled to premiere in 2023.  The first season of Jujustu Kaisen is available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Gege Akutami's manga is available in English from VIZ Media. Pui Pui Molcar is available for streaming on Netflix.

Jujutsu Kaisen revealed a new collaboration the stop-motion series Pui Pui Molcar.  What started out as an April Fool's joke has now become a legitimate collaboration. The official Jujutsu Kaisen Twitter account announced that the series will cross over with the popular stop-motion animated series Pui Pui Molcar and revealed new art, which features the cast of Gege Akutami's dark-fantasy shonen series being paired up with their own hybrid guinea pigs/cars. The art work will appear on special merchandise, which will be released at a later date. The collaboration's official website also teases further announcements related to the crossover. RELATED: How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche          On April 1, Jujutsu Kaisen tweeted out an image of Masamichi Yaga, which was edited to look like he was holding Potato, the main character from Pui Pui Molcar. Yaga is the principal of Tokyo's Jujutsu High School, and possesses the ability to bring dolls to life with his special Cursed ability. Despite his intimidating appearance and demeanor, he frequently displays a preference for cute things, such as stuffed animals, which is probably the reason why he was the character who was picked to introduce the series' Molcar collaboration. Pui Pui Molcar premiered in Japan in early 2021 and is distributed internationally by Netflix. The series takes place in a world where humans drive sentient vehicles that resemble guinea pigs but have car-like qualities, such as wheels and doors. While intended for younger demographics, the series was a hit with fans of all ages, with praise going towards its adorably designed characters and simple humor. The 12-episode series was followed up with the release of a movie, entitled Tobidase! Narase! Pui Pui Molcar, which was released in Japan last July.  RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Tops $30 Million, Leading Actors to Reveal Shockingly Low Pay Rates Jujutsu Kaisen, meanwhile, continues to be one of Japan's biggest anime and manga franchises. Gege Akutami's gritty work about the battle between sorcerers and cursed spirits was the best-selling manga of 2021, narrowly edging out Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba. The series first movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0, premiered in Japan last December, where it quickly became the highest-grossing film for 2021 in the region. The movie was released in North America last March, where it earned an addition $30 million USD. The movie has now pulled in over $180 million USD worldwide, making it one of the ten highest-grossing anime movies ever made. A second season of the anime series is scheduled to premiere in 2023.  The first season of Jujustu Kaisen is available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Gege Akutami's manga is available in English from VIZ Media. Pui Pui Molcar is available for streaming on Netflix.

Home Anime Your Name Creator Debuts Gorgeous First Trailer for New Movie, Suzume No Tojimari    Your Name Creator Debuts Gorgeous First Trailer for New Movie, Suzume No Tojimari  By Michael Lacerna Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Toho releases the haunting first trailer for Suzume No Tojimari, the latest work from Your Name and Weathering With You director Makoto Shinkai.                 Toho Co. Ltd. released the first trailer for Suzume No Tojimari, the new movie from Your Name director Makoto Shinkai.  The trailer introduces the movie's titular protagonist, Suzume, and the mysterious door that's at the center of the new film's plot. In addition to showcasing the new film's art style and animation, the trailer also reveals a Japanese premiere date for the movie, November 11. RELATED: Weathering With You's Big Your Name Connection, Explained    The film tells the story of Suzume, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a quiet small town in Japan's southern Kyushu island. Suzume discovers a door standing by itself in the middle of an abandoned and ruined building, and is compelled to open it. When she does, however, similar doors suddenly sprout up all over Japan, unleashing destruction and chaos wherever they appear.  As with many of his previous films, Suzume No Tojimari was both written and directed by Shinkai. The movie will see the celebrated director reunite with character designer Masayoshi Tanaka, who also served the same role on Your Name and Weathering With You. Takumi Tanji, who previously worked on Shinkai's 5 Centimeters Per Second and Children Who Chase Lost Voices, serves as the new film's art director. The animated film is being produced at CoMix Wave Films and Story Inc., with Toho distributing. RELATED: Your Name Stands Alone, But Fans Can't Let Go of Its Spinoff Potential Shinkai is one of the biggest names in the anime industry today, and his work is now frequently compared to Studio Ghibli's most well known auteur, Hayao Miyazaki. The director began his career at video game developer Falcom (Ys, Trails in the Sky) before moving on to anime with his directorial debut, the self-produced short She and Her Cat in 1999. Shinkai continued with the critically acclaimed Voices of a Distant Star in 2000 and his first feature length production, The Place Promised In Our Early Days, which was released in 2004 to widespread praise. Shinkai's breakout hit arrived in 2016 with the runaway success of the romantic comedy Your Name, which was the first non-Studio Ghibli anime film to earn over $100 million at the Japanese box office.

Toho Co. Ltd. released the first trailer for Suzume No Tojimari, the new movie from Your Name director Makoto Shinkai.  The trailer introduces the movie's titular protagonist, Suzume, and the mysterious door that's at the center of the new film's plot. In addition to showcasing the new film's art style and animation, the trailer also reveals a Japanese premiere date for the movie, November 11. RELATED: Weathering With You's Big Your Name Connection, Explained    The film tells the story of Suzume, a 17-year-old girl who lives in a quiet small town in Japan's southern Kyushu island. Suzume discovers a door standing by itself in the middle of an abandoned and ruined building, and is compelled to open it. When she does, however, similar doors suddenly sprout up all over Japan, unleashing destruction and chaos wherever they appear.  As with many of his previous films, Suzume No Tojimari was both written and directed by Shinkai. The movie will see the celebrated director reunite with character designer Masayoshi Tanaka, who also served the same role on Your Name and Weathering With You. Takumi Tanji, who previously worked on Shinkai's 5 Centimeters Per Second and Children Who Chase Lost Voices, serves as the new film's art director. The animated film is being produced at CoMix Wave Films and Story Inc., with Toho distributing. RELATED: Your Name Stands Alone, But Fans Can't Let Go of Its Spinoff Potential Shinkai is one of the biggest names in the anime industry today, and his work is now frequently compared to Studio Ghibli's most well known auteur, Hayao Miyazaki. The director began his career at video game developer Falcom (Ys, Trails in the Sky) before moving on to anime with his directorial debut, the self-produced short She and Her Cat in 1999. Shinkai continued with the critically acclaimed Voices of a Distant Star in 2000 and his first feature length production, The Place Promised In Our Early Days, which was released in 2004 to widespread praise. Shinkai's breakout hit arrived in 2016 with the runaway success of the romantic comedy Your Name, which was the first non-Studio Ghibli anime film to earn over $100 million at the Japanese box office.  Details about the Suzume No Tojimari's international release, including an official translation for its title, have yet to be released. Your Name is currently available on DVD, Blu-ray and on-demand video from Funimation. Weathering With You is currently streaming on HBO Max. Distributor GKIDS recently announced that it has licensed four of Shinkai's earlier works and will be re-releasing the films on home video.

People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make \"easy money\" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: \"return to the assassin world, or die!\"  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.

People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make \"easy money\" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: \"return to the assassin world, or die!\"  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.

Several characters lost their lives in the most horrific way.                  Hunter X Hunter is one of the oldest and most influential battle shonen currently in publication. Following the adventures of Gon and Killua, Hunter X Hunter explores the dangerous world of being a professional Hunter. Viewers have desperately wanted to travel to the Hunter X Hunter world to experience the rich culture and develop a unique Nen ability.  RELATED: 10 Times Hunter X Hunter Broke Our Hearts But while Hunter X Hunter may seem like an attractive destination spot on the surface, fans know just how ruthless this world can be. In Hunter X Hunter, death awaits around every corner.  10          Pitou Would Puppet Your Reanimated Corpse                 Hunter X Hunter has delivered on a number of climactic, emotionally devastating character deaths throughout its long tenure as an anime. But no character death compares to the heartbreak fans felt when they watched Gon's newest mentor die at the hands of Pitou during the Chimera Ant arc. Pitou was an unstoppable force of strength who acted with the curiosity and playfulness of a cat. But the last thing fans would want is to cross Pitou and end up as their reanimated corpse toy like Kite.  9          Hisoka Would Toy With You In A Hopeless Battle                 Veterans battle shonen fans know what it's like to wish they could travel into their favorite anime and test their might against some of the world's greatest battlers. Fans dream of becoming a professional Hunter and competing in Heaven's Arena for treasure and glory. But if there's one combatant no fan would dream of fighting, it would be the terrifying clown, Hisoka. Hisoka is a tactical mastermind with trickster abilities and a knack for punishment. Fighting him is a hopeless endeavor that would result in a slow, miserable death.  8          Children Are Prone To Tragic Death In Hunter X Hunter                 Hunter X Hunter has often stood out from its contemporaries in the shonen genre for its brutal and dark sequences. Hunter X Hunter is no stranger to grim depictions of death and torture. It's no surprise that in this world, even children are not safe. RELATED: 10 Responsible Anime Children Who Behave Like Adults Often in Hunter X Hunter, young characters are used to build empathy from the audience before tragically getting ripped away for a dramatic moment. Kurt and Reina are two of the most tragic examples as they were killed and fed to the Chimera Ant Queen at just nine and five years old. Easily one of the worst ways to die in the Hunter X Hunter universe would be as a small child trying to live a simple life.  7          Pokkle Had His Brain Probed After Death                 The Chimera Ant arc saw the devastation and destruction of many unique characters. Some of these deaths came quickly to build audience shock. But many were drawn out and slow to really hammer in the growing threat of the Chimera Ants. Pokkle's brain dissection by Pitou is one of the most horrifying images to ever come out of the anime. Seeing an old fan-favorite character get probed and prodded as a corpse was traumatizing to many viewers.  6          Feitan's Rising Sun Technique Can Melt An Army                 The Phantom Troupe was introduced during the Yorknew City arc. They immediately stood out as being some of the most powerful and mysterious villains created thus far.  RELATED: 10 Things In Hunter X Hunter That Aged Poorly While not every Troupe member was able to receive ample screen time during that initial arc, a few got reintroduced during the Chimera Ant arc as they traveled to defeat an Ant taking over their home city. During this sequence, Feitan unveiled a mesmerizing Nen ability that allowed the Troupe member to summon the heat and force of a sun. This is a death no fan would ever wish to experience.  5          If Poor Man's Rose Doesn't Kill You, The Radiation Will                 During the climax of the Chimera Ant arc, Meruem faced off with humanity's strongest warrior, Isaac Netero. It was a thrilling battle that had humankind's fate on the line. But fate seemed grim when Isaac Netero was bested and failed to defeat Meruem.  At that moment, however, the Poor Man's Rose bomb was activated. It was an explosion powerful enough to kill thousands. But even if one was lucky enough to survive as Meruem did, they'd fall victim to the bomb's radiation poison shortly after. A harrowing death that has no hope for escape.  4          Chrollo Has A Wide Variety Of Torture Techniques                 When the Phantom Troupe was introduced as the primary antagonists of the Yorknew City arc, Chrollo peaked audience intrigue for the new villain group. Chrollo is an enigmatic figure with a powerful Nen ability and the intelligence to wield it. Fans first glimpse at Chrollo's power was when Chrollo brutalized one of Hunter X Hunter's strongest assassins and tortured him with floating Nen fish that consumed his living body. This was a horrific ability that made Chrollo seem unstoppable.  3          Some Nen Users Make You Listen To How They'll Kill You                The implementation of vows and limitations is a unique aspect of Hunter X Hunter's power system. Nen is a complex system that allows a user to set their own limitation and in return gain a boost of power. One common rule that a Nen user might set is that their ability grows in strength if they explain it to their opponent. This creates a scary situation where one might hear their opponent describe their own ability and thus know the fight is about to get harder. In essence, a character might just hear their opponent spell out their death.  2          Chimera Ant Food Is Reborn Into The Species That Killed It                 The danger of the Chimera Ants is their ability to rapidly evolve based on the food that was eaten when they were born. This led to Chimera Ants developing unique abilities usually reserved for powerful predator animals, or even worse, Nen-wielding humans. RELATED: 10 Ways Hunter X Hunter Is Better When You\u2019re An Adult But the worst aspect of being eaten by a Chimera Ant is that some semblance of a character's soul seems to pass on to the eventual Ant born from their body. That feeling of being reborn into the creature that killed and ate you is a unique horror that no living being could ever relate to.  1          Nanika's Mysterious Powers Can Wish Anyone To Death                Hunter X Hunter's final arc introduced Killua Zoldyck's younger sister. Alluka/Nanika is a mysterious entity that has the power to grant wishes and demand sacrifice. Those who ask a wish of the young girl can be granted infinite power, status, or wealth. But these wishes come at the cost of a proportionate sacrifice, often in the form of death. It's a tricky ability that only Killua knows how to navigate, making Alluka/Nanika one of the most terrifying harbingers of death in Hunter X Hunter.                  10 Shonen Anime That Are Too Dark For Their Own Good  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime anime Hunter X Hunter     About The Author      Derek DeSantis                                     (53 Articles Published)       More                     From Derek DeSantis          Popular                     Movie Features   Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Is It Too Early for [SPOILER]?

But the last thing fans would want is to cross Pitou and end up as their reanimated corpse toy like Kite.  9          Hisoka Would Toy With You In A Hopeless Battle                 Veterans battle shonen fans know what it's like to wish they could travel into their favorite anime and test their might against some of the world's greatest battlers. Fans dream of becoming a professional Hunter and competing in Heaven's Arena for treasure and glory. But if there's one combatant no fan would dream of fighting, it would be the terrifying clown, Hisoka. Hisoka is a tactical mastermind with trickster abilities and a knack for punishment. Fighting him is a hopeless endeavor that would result in a slow, miserable death.  8          Children Are Prone To Tragic Death In Hunter X Hunter                 Hunter X Hunter has often stood out from its contemporaries in the shonen genre for its brutal and dark sequences. Hunter X Hunter is no stranger to grim depictions of death and torture. It's no surprise that in this world, even children are not safe. RELATED: 10 Responsible Anime Children Who Behave Like Adults Often in Hunter X Hunter, young characters are used to build empathy from the audience before tragically getting ripped away for a dramatic moment. Kurt and Reina are two of the most tragic examples as they were killed and fed to the Chimera Ant Queen at just nine and five years old. Easily one of the worst ways to die in the Hunter X Hunter universe would be as a small child trying to live a simple life.  7          Pokkle Had His Brain Probed After Death                 The Chimera Ant arc saw the devastation and destruction of many unique characters. Some of these deaths came quickly to build audience shock. But many were drawn out and slow to really hammer in the growing threat of the Chimera Ants. Pokkle's brain dissection by Pitou is one of the most horrifying images to ever come out of the anime. Seeing an old fan-favorite character get probed and prodded as a corpse was traumatizing to many viewers.  6          Feitan's Rising Sun Technique Can Melt An Army                 The Phantom Troupe was introduced during the Yorknew City arc. They immediately stood out as being some of the most powerful and mysterious villains created thus far.  RELATED: 10 Things In Hunter X Hunter That Aged Poorly While not every Troupe member was able to receive ample screen time during that initial arc, a few got reintroduced during the Chimera Ant arc as they traveled to defeat an Ant taking over their home city. During this sequence, Feitan unveiled a mesmerizing Nen ability that allowed the Troupe member to summon the heat and force of a sun. This is a death no fan would ever wish to experience.  5          If Poor Man's Rose Doesn't Kill You, The Radiation Will                 During the climax of the Chimera Ant arc, Meruem faced off with humanity's strongest warrior, Isaac Netero. It was a thrilling battle that had humankind's fate on the line. But fate seemed grim when Isaac Netero was bested and failed to defeat Meruem.  At that moment, however, the Poor Man's Rose bomb was activated. It was an explosion powerful enough to kill thousands. But even if one was lucky enough to survive as Meruem did, they'd fall victim to the bomb's radiation poison shortly after. A harrowing death that has no hope for escape.  4          Chrollo Has A Wide Variety Of Torture Techniques                 When the Phantom Troupe was introduced as the primary antagonists of the Yorknew City arc, Chrollo peaked audience intrigue for the new villain group. Chrollo is an enigmatic figure with a powerful Nen ability and the intelligence to wield it. Fans first glimpse at Chrollo's power was when Chrollo brutalized one of Hunter X Hunter's strongest assassins and tortured him with floating Nen fish that consumed his living body. This was a horrific ability that made Chrollo seem unstoppable.  3          Some Nen Users Make You Listen To How They'll Kill You                The implementation of vows and limitations is a unique aspect of Hunter X Hunter's power system. Nen is a complex system that allows a user to set their own limitation and in return gain a boost of power. One common rule that a Nen user might set is that their ability grows in strength if they explain it to their opponent. This creates a scary situation where one might hear their opponent describe their own ability and thus know the fight is about to get harder. In essence, a character might just hear their opponent spell out their death.  2          Chimera Ant Food Is Reborn Into The Species That Killed It                 The danger of the Chimera Ants is their ability to rapidly evolve based on the food that was eaten when they were born. This led to Chimera Ants developing unique abilities usually reserved for powerful predator animals, or even worse, Nen-wielding humans. RELATED: 10 Ways Hunter X Hunter Is Better When You\u2019re An Adult But the worst aspect of being eaten by a Chimera Ant is that some semblance of a character's soul seems to pass on to the eventual Ant born from their body. That feeling of being reborn into the creature that killed and ate you is a unique horror that no living being could ever relate to.  1          Nanika's Mysterious Powers Can Wish Anyone To Death                Hunter X Hunter's final arc introduced Killua Zoldyck's younger sister. Alluka/Nanika is a mysterious entity that has the power to grant wishes and demand sacrifice. Those who ask a wish of the young girl can be granted infinite power, status, or wealth. But these wishes come at the cost of a proportionate sacrifice, often in the form of death. It's a tricky ability that only Killua knows how to navigate, making Alluka/Nanika one of the most terrifying harbingers of death in Hunter X Hunter.                  10 Shonen Anime That Are Too Dark For Their Own Good  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime anime Hunter X Hunter     About The Author      Derek DeSantis                                     (53 Articles Published)       More                     From Derek DeSantis          Popular                     Movie Features   Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Is It Too Early for [SPOILER]?

Josh Bell Apr 1, 2022                      Morbius\u2019 Rushed & Muddled Story Won\u2019t Quench Audiences' Thirst  Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be.  Sam Stone Mar 31, 2022                      The Contractor Drops Chris Pine in a Generic Spy Thriller With Little Depth  The Contractor is a standard spy story that makes an effort to engage with deeper themes about the treatment of veterans but falls short.

Samuel Gelman Mar 22, 2022                      Measure of Revenge\u2019s Muddled Ambitions Lead to a Middling Thriller  Measure of Revenge features some interesting moments and a strong female lead but gets muddled in too many genres and styles to truly land.  Jon Mendelsohn Mar 21, 2022                      REVIEW: Umma Teases a Provocative Story But Overuses Haunted House Tropes  Although Umma opens as a film that's easy to root for -- due to its complex story and unique imagery -- it relies too much on haunted house tropes.  Caitlin Chappell Mar 21, 2022                      Everything Everywhere All At Once Flaunts Michelle Yeoh's Unmatched Star Power  A24's Everything Everywhere All At Once is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, filled with fantastic action set-pieces and loads of heart.

Josh Bell Mar 18, 2022                      REVIEW: Ti West's X Serves a Fun & Sensual Bloodbath With a Killer Message  From its opening scene, Ti West's X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.

It has everything that makes the latter great and more.                 Anime adaptations gaining their source material a significant rise in sales and popularity have been particularly noteworthy over the past few years. Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, Tokyo Revengers and Haikyuu are just a few such franchises. Considering the quality of the Aoashi manga, there's no reason why it shouldn't be another series on this list. The anime seems to be adapting its source material faithfully, so it will be no surprise if it becomes a favorite of the Spring 2022 anime season.  Haikyuu fans who have been looking for another high quality sports anime don't need to look any further than Aoashi. Fans of the popular volleyball-themed series will likely find Aoashi easy to love, as it has all the great qualities that made Haikyuu such a huge hit. From its characters to the overarching plot, the writing in Aoashi is genuinely spectacular. There are plenty of fans who will likely enjoy it just as much as Haikyuu -- and reasons why they might even enjoy it more. RELATED: My Hero Academia Reboots as a Sports Anime for April Fools                 Aoashi follows Ashito Aoi, a 15-year-old soccer player fresh out of middle school who aims to achieve his dream of being a professional player. He is discovered while playing in one of his junior high matches by Tatsuya Fukuda, the coach of an elite youth soccer club named Tokyo Esperion. Fukuda spots something special about the way Ashito plays and ends up recruiting him. The coach would be proved correct when Ashito explains what he did during the game. However, there are many problems with Ashito's playing style, not least the fact that he's unaware of the unique skill he possesses.  Fukuda will completely change the way Ashito views the sport he has loved since he was a child. Everything he thought he knew, including his own abilities, will be flipped upside down. Ashito's enrollment in Tokyo Esperion becomes a journey of discovery as he realizes he's not nearly as good at soccer as he thought. He'll essentially have to start from square one on a team filled with gifted players, many of whom look down on him. Fortunately he makes new friends who are willing to help him every step of the way. Ashito is a similar protagonist to Haikyuu's Hinata Shoyo in that they're both underdogs who are used to being underestimated. The big difference between them is that Hinata is a talented player, while Ashito has to face the reality that he's actually quite mediocre. Hinata is underestimated simply because he's noticeably shorter than the average volleyball player. Ashito, on the other hand, is lacking fundamental skills.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 Another similarity between these two sports anime is the care put into the entire cast's development. Like Haikyuu, Aoashi has a supporting cast packed with compelling characters and storylines. This includes the female characters who are written with just as much nuance as the males. Fans can expect the development arcs in this show to hit all the right notes, and the best part is that it's not just about soccer. Aoashi explores many serious and emotional themes such as neglectful parents, prejudice, losing love for the sport, overwhelming pressure to succeed and how it all affects these teenagers on and off the field.  Following the journey of Ashito and the rest of the cast will be a pleasure for anyone who enjoys multifaceted characters and stories. Soccer fans will find that this anime depicts the sport in a realistic and exciting way that could make anyone fall in love with it. Aoashi deserves to be a breakout hit this season and is worthy of following in the steps of Haikyuu's widespread success.

It has everything that makes the latter great and more.                 Anime adaptations gaining their source material a significant rise in sales and popularity have been particularly noteworthy over the past few years. Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer, Tokyo Revengers and Haikyuu are just a few such franchises. Considering the quality of the Aoashi manga, there's no reason why it shouldn't be another series on this list. The anime seems to be adapting its source material faithfully, so it will be no surprise if it becomes a favorite of the Spring 2022 anime season.  Haikyuu fans who have been looking for another high quality sports anime don't need to look any further than Aoashi. Fans of the popular volleyball-themed series will likely find Aoashi easy to love, as it has all the great qualities that made Haikyuu such a huge hit. From its characters to the overarching plot, the writing in Aoashi is genuinely spectacular. There are plenty of fans who will likely enjoy it just as much as Haikyuu -- and reasons why they might even enjoy it more. RELATED: My Hero Academia Reboots as a Sports Anime for April Fools                 Aoashi follows Ashito Aoi, a 15-year-old soccer player fresh out of middle school who aims to achieve his dream of being a professional player. He is discovered while playing in one of his junior high matches by Tatsuya Fukuda, the coach of an elite youth soccer club named Tokyo Esperion. Fukuda spots something special about the way Ashito plays and ends up recruiting him. The coach would be proved correct when Ashito explains what he did during the game. However, there are many problems with Ashito's playing style, not least the fact that he's unaware of the unique skill he possesses.  Fukuda will completely change the way Ashito views the sport he has loved since he was a child. Everything he thought he knew, including his own abilities, will be flipped upside down. Ashito's enrollment in Tokyo Esperion becomes a journey of discovery as he realizes he's not nearly as good at soccer as he thought. He'll essentially have to start from square one on a team filled with gifted players, many of whom look down on him. Fortunately he makes new friends who are willing to help him every step of the way. Ashito is a similar protagonist to Haikyuu's Hinata Shoyo in that they're both underdogs who are used to being underestimated. The big difference between them is that Hinata is a talented player, while Ashito has to face the reality that he's actually quite mediocre. Hinata is underestimated simply because he's noticeably shorter than the average volleyball player. Ashito, on the other hand, is lacking fundamental skills.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 Another similarity between these two sports anime is the care put into the entire cast's development. Like Haikyuu, Aoashi has a supporting cast packed with compelling characters and storylines. This includes the female characters who are written with just as much nuance as the males. Fans can expect the development arcs in this show to hit all the right notes, and the best part is that it's not just about soccer. Aoashi explores many serious and emotional themes such as neglectful parents, prejudice, losing love for the sport, overwhelming pressure to succeed and how it all affects these teenagers on and off the field.  Following the journey of Ashito and the rest of the cast will be a pleasure for anyone who enjoys multifaceted characters and stories. Soccer fans will find that this anime depicts the sport in a realistic and exciting way that could make anyone fall in love with it. Aoashi deserves to be a breakout hit this season and is worthy of following in the steps of Haikyuu's widespread success.

The arrival of spring in Japan is marked by the blossoming of the cherry blossom trees, known as sakura in Japanese. Every year, people flock to local parks to sit under the blooming flowers and have picnics, as the flowers fade away after about two weeks. The trees are so iconic that they're often featured in anime to signal the spring season and the start of a new school year. It's also common for girls to be named Sakura, such as the titular character from Cardcaptor Sakura and the pink-haired kunoichi from Naruto, or to be named Sakurako, with ko being a common feature of female Japanese names.  Nowadays, sakura are more popular than ever; they're commonly planted outside schools, in parks, at shrines and temples, and at gravesites and cemeteries. Seasonal foods like sakura teas and even KitKats are created to celebrate the flower. It's common to have sakura designs for weddings and other celebrations, as they are a sign of new beginnings and possibilities. In anime, they are often shown when a character begins at a new school or a new academic year starts, so much so that it's become a trope reference in other media. They have become a sign of good luck and fortune. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga                  At one point in time, sakura flowers were a symbol of fragility and a quick end because of how suddenly they bloom and fall. It was common to refer to relationships that ended quickly after forming as sakurazame -- the time when the flower falls from the tree. From around the Feudal Period to the beginning of the Edo Period, sakura flowers were considered bad luck because of their fragility, especially in terms of romance and marriage. Part of the reason for these negative feelings toward such a beautiful pink flower could stem from a morbid legend. Similarities between death and cherry trees have been a part of Japanese literature for years, but few could imagine how close the two could be. It has been said that dead bodies are buried beneath sakura trees. In one short story, \"Under the Cherry Tree\" by Motojiro Kaiji, the opening line states, \"Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!\"  The origin of this legend is unclear, but many associate its start with this story. It's speculated that the line is a reference to hanami, or flower viewing, but some think it's more literal. The line became so popular and well-known that it was used as the basis for the title of the series A Corpse is Buried Under Sakurako's Feet, also known as Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation.  RELATED: What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?                 This association with death comes not only from how quickly the flowers come and go but also how early samurai tended to die. Because samurai were expected to give everything to their lords, adhering to a strict moral code, they tended to die fairly young. They were supposed to hold their heads high and die with honor on the battlefield. If they were accused of breaking their moral code, they were expected to commit seppuku, slicing themselves across the stomach. Because of the short lives of these samurai, sakura became associated with them and would later become the iconography of kamikaze fighters in World War II, who were likewise meant to give up their lives for their emperor.  Despite how beautiful the flowers are, there will always be this haunting association with death in the back of many people's minds. The historical and literary melding of sakura and death has become so ingrained that there's a bittersweet feeling when looking at the petals as they fall. They are a sign that life is fragile and can end suddenly without warning. They are a symbol of how fleeting life can be, and how people should therefore enjoy the time they have left with the people they love.

Suicide Squad #14 (2022)   Writer  Dennis Hopeless    Artist  Eduardo Pansica, Julio Ferreira, Dexter Soy    Letterer  Wes Abbot    Publisher  DC Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-05    Colorist  Jeremiah Skipper, Peter Pantazis      The War for Earth-3 has come to an end and opened a new chapter for the rebel hero-villains of the Suicide Squad. Written by Dennis Hopeless, with visuals from artist Eduardo Pansica, J\u00falio Ferreira, and Dexter Soy, colors by Jeremiah Skipper and Peter Pantazis, and letters by Wes Abbot, Suicide Squad #14 brings to an end a promising arc of a usually thrilling series, but with a few twists. This issue, entitled \"Defunded - Part 1,\" picks up where the last issue left off after Amanda Waller's victory over the Evil Justice League of Earth-3 with the reluctant assistance of the Suicide Squad.  Victory is short-lived, however. Back in their own dimension, the Squad is in shambles. Two members died in battle, with Talon dying soon after, Culebra is left without a body, Belle Reve has been destroyed, Amanda Waller is M.I.A., and the Task Force X is disbanded. The Squad finds themselves without purpose or funding, though at least they got to keep Bloodsport and his brothers. What's a ragtag team of misfit heroes to do now? Their first mission is to reconvene, then they must find new funding, at any cost. Rick Flag has a few ideas on how to get it. Related: The X-Men's Oldest Rivals Created a Marvel Suicide Squad Years Before the Thunderbolts                 Suicide Squad is a franchise known for its reckless abandon, chaos, dark humor, and disregard for convention, matching the wild-card attitudes of its ragtag cast of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and misfits. Everything from victories and losses to brutal deaths and mutilations has a wicked sense of comedy to them. Most of the time, it's effective. However, Suicide Squad #14 doesn't quite match this energy. In this series, the last 13 issues have focused on the crossover event, the War for Earth-3. It was a high-stakes battle with plenty of bloodshed, casualties, and drama that ended abruptly. This is a recurring problem for Suicide Squad #14. Plots that were previously built up, character arcs that were being developed, and new twists for the story are all dropped abruptly and with little to no warning or resolution. Belle Reve's destruction is sudden and feels almost aimless, doing nothing more than scattering the Squad a little further -- a problem that is resolved pretty quickly. Talon's death is a mere hand wave and lacks the impact it could have had, despite his final tender moment with Culebra, which Ambug Bug so kindly elaborates on for the audience's benefit.  This sort of irreverence is par for the course for the Suicide Squad, which has reveled in its subversive take on superheroes and the conventions of the DC Comics canon. However, it fails here because the issue loses much of its narrative momentum immediately afterward, save for a few scenes that, while action-filled and fun, feel disjointed. Related: Suicide Squad's Bloodsport is Trying to Solve a Multiversal Mystery                Up to this point, writer Dennis Hopeless has captured the tone and pacing of the Suicide Squad nicely; however, this issue is lacking in comparison because the previous arc dropped right as it was picking up steam. Suicide Squad #14 feels less like another chapter in a story and more like a filler issue between two arcs. The issue focuses on picking up the pieces of the Earth-3 storyline and scrambling to tie loose ends, which can be frustrating to read.  However, Suicide Squad #14 isn't without a few draws. There are glimmers of that signature twisted humor that makes the series so enjoyable. Ambush Bug is the standout of the cast for his carefree, naive attitude, quick wit, and distinctive speech patterns. His chemistry with Peacemaker, in all his surly and violent glory, steals the show. The visuals shine here as well, with the line art having a rough, almost unfinished quality with pulpy, grimy textures in the colors. Suicide Squad #14 doesn't feel like a conclusion to an arc but rather a bridge between two stories -- one that can be difficult for some readers to cross without some sense of disappointment.

Suicide Squad #14 (2022)   Writer  Dennis Hopeless    Artist  Eduardo Pansica, Julio Ferreira, Dexter Soy    Letterer  Wes Abbot    Publisher  DC Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-05    Colorist  Jeremiah Skipper, Peter Pantazis      The War for Earth-3 has come to an end and opened a new chapter for the rebel hero-villains of the Suicide Squad. Written by Dennis Hopeless, with visuals from artist Eduardo Pansica, J\u00falio Ferreira, and Dexter Soy, colors by Jeremiah Skipper and Peter Pantazis, and letters by Wes Abbot, Suicide Squad #14 brings to an end a promising arc of a usually thrilling series, but with a few twists. This issue, entitled \"Defunded - Part 1,\" picks up where the last issue left off after Amanda Waller's victory over the Evil Justice League of Earth-3 with the reluctant assistance of the Suicide Squad.  Victory is short-lived, however. Back in their own dimension, the Squad is in shambles. Two members died in battle, with Talon dying soon after, Culebra is left without a body, Belle Reve has been destroyed, Amanda Waller is M.I.A., and the Task Force X is disbanded. The Squad finds themselves without purpose or funding, though at least they got to keep Bloodsport and his brothers. What's a ragtag team of misfit heroes to do now? Their first mission is to reconvene, then they must find new funding, at any cost. Rick Flag has a few ideas on how to get it. Related: The X-Men's Oldest Rivals Created a Marvel Suicide Squad Years Before the Thunderbolts                 Suicide Squad is a franchise known for its reckless abandon, chaos, dark humor, and disregard for convention, matching the wild-card attitudes of its ragtag cast of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and misfits. Everything from victories and losses to brutal deaths and mutilations has a wicked sense of comedy to them. Most of the time, it's effective. However, Suicide Squad #14 doesn't quite match this energy. In this series, the last 13 issues have focused on the crossover event, the War for Earth-3. It was a high-stakes battle with plenty of bloodshed, casualties, and drama that ended abruptly. This is a recurring problem for Suicide Squad #14. Plots that were previously built up, character arcs that were being developed, and new twists for the story are all dropped abruptly and with little to no warning or resolution. Belle Reve's destruction is sudden and feels almost aimless, doing nothing more than scattering the Squad a little further -- a problem that is resolved pretty quickly. Talon's death is a mere hand wave and lacks the impact it could have had, despite his final tender moment with Culebra, which Ambug Bug so kindly elaborates on for the audience's benefit.  This sort of irreverence is par for the course for the Suicide Squad, which has reveled in its subversive take on superheroes and the conventions of the DC Comics canon. However, it fails here because the issue loses much of its narrative momentum immediately afterward, save for a few scenes that, while action-filled and fun, feel disjointed. Related: Suicide Squad's Bloodsport is Trying to Solve a Multiversal Mystery                Up to this point, writer Dennis Hopeless has captured the tone and pacing of the Suicide Squad nicely; however, this issue is lacking in comparison because the previous arc dropped right as it was picking up steam. Suicide Squad #14 feels less like another chapter in a story and more like a filler issue between two arcs. The issue focuses on picking up the pieces of the Earth-3 storyline and scrambling to tie loose ends, which can be frustrating to read.  However, Suicide Squad #14 isn't without a few draws. There are glimmers of that signature twisted humor that makes the series so enjoyable. Ambush Bug is the standout of the cast for his carefree, naive attitude, quick wit, and distinctive speech patterns. His chemistry with Peacemaker, in all his surly and violent glory, steals the show. The visuals shine here as well, with the line art having a rough, almost unfinished quality with pulpy, grimy textures in the colors. Suicide Squad #14 doesn't feel like a conclusion to an arc but rather a bridge between two stories -- one that can be difficult for some readers to cross without some sense of disappointment. However, the ending scene and a promising tease of Lex Luthor's involvement in the story give readers plenty of incentive to make their way to the other side.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 2 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It, now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The returning rom-com anime Science Fell in Love continues to up the ante in Season 2, early in the Spring 2022 season. Episode 1 saw Ayame and Shinya meet their match against the lovestruck scientist couple Chris and Suiu, who easily outclassed the co-protagonists' oxytocin levels during their experiments together.  Now in Episode 2, the stubborn kuudere Yukimura Shinya prepares himself for round two against this seemingly perfect scientist couple -- but no matter what he does, he simply cannot match Chris and Suiu's oxytocin levels. Like a true shonen hero, Shinya must get creative and find a solution as the series' underdog. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime                Despite his clear disadvantage against Chris and Suiu, Shinya insists on more oxytocin tests, and everyone obliges. The young scientists even try different combinations of partners, but problems arise when Suiu comes on to Shinya too strongly -- and Ayame becomes jealous of how Shinya keeps ogling her. This creates tension between them, and sure enough, that lowers their oxytocin levels even more. Ayame was even paired up with her platonic friend Kanade, who still had higher oxytocin levels with her than Shinya did.  Shinya suffers total defeat not just from the lab results, but also from Chris harshly calling him a fool who cannot recognize true love. Shinya feels outraged, but there is nothing he can say or do to defend himself in that argument -- even when the generous Ayame steps in to shield him. Everyone calms down soon enough but Shinya, still panicking and embarrassed, insists on burning the midnight oil in the lab to find a solution to all this. He channels his shonen side like never before, and it's exactly what he and Ayame need right now. His fortunes are soon reversed thanks to his hard work.  RELATED: Why Summer Time Rendering is the Mystery-Horror Anime to Watch This Spring                In true shonen fashion, Shinya confronts Chris and Suiu yet again -- but this time he has a secret technique to win the battle, scientist-style. He and Ayame admit their oxytocin levels are inferior, but fortunately for them this is excusable. Shinya cites a study from Helen Fisher and others, stating that a typical romantic relationship has an initial phase defined by strong but unstable and often aggressive feelings, including yandere-style jealousy and temper tantrums. After about three years the relationship will cool down and stabilize, and the two partners will have higher oxytocin levels when they are together. Shinya and Ayame are in that initial stage while Chris and Suiu are in the second, proving that it's unfair to compare their oxytocin levels.  That, combined with the fact that there are other relevant hormones to study, allows Shinya and Ayame to finally land an intellectual blow on Chris and Suiu and keep them in the running as a potential romantic couple after all. Chris and Suiu, feeling equally surprised and impressed, both voice their support for the developing couple. In light of that, Science Fell in Love might soon revert back to its Kaguya-sama themed battle of wits narrative, unless another perfect couple or skeptic comes along to challenge Shinya's and Ayame's love once again. Shinya must be ready for anything and stay on his toes, just in case. He's won his latest battle, but the war goes on.

Episode 1 saw Ayame and Shinya meet their match against the lovestruck scientist couple Chris and Suiu, who easily outclassed the co-protagonists' oxytocin levels during their experiments together.  Now in Episode 2, the stubborn kuudere Yukimura Shinya prepares himself for round two against this seemingly perfect scientist couple -- but no matter what he does, he simply cannot match Chris and Suiu's oxytocin levels. Like a true shonen hero, Shinya must get creative and find a solution as the series' underdog. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime                Despite his clear disadvantage against Chris and Suiu, Shinya insists on more oxytocin tests, and everyone obliges. The young scientists even try different combinations of partners, but problems arise when Suiu comes on to Shinya too strongly -- and Ayame becomes jealous of how Shinya keeps ogling her. This creates tension between them, and sure enough, that lowers their oxytocin levels even more. Ayame was even paired up with her platonic friend Kanade, who still had higher oxytocin levels with her than Shinya did.  Shinya suffers total defeat not just from the lab results, but also from Chris harshly calling him a fool who cannot recognize true love. Shinya feels outraged, but there is nothing he can say or do to defend himself in that argument -- even when the generous Ayame steps in to shield him. Everyone calms down soon enough but Shinya, still panicking and embarrassed, insists on burning the midnight oil in the lab to find a solution to all this. He channels his shonen side like never before, and it's exactly what he and Ayame need right now. His fortunes are soon reversed thanks to his hard work.  RELATED: Why Summer Time Rendering is the Mystery-Horror Anime to Watch This Spring                In true shonen fashion, Shinya confronts Chris and Suiu yet again -- but this time he has a secret technique to win the battle, scientist-style. He and Ayame admit their oxytocin levels are inferior, but fortunately for them this is excusable. Shinya cites a study from Helen Fisher and others, stating that a typical romantic relationship has an initial phase defined by strong but unstable and often aggressive feelings, including yandere-style jealousy and temper tantrums. After about three years the relationship will cool down and stabilize, and the two partners will have higher oxytocin levels when they are together. Shinya and Ayame are in that initial stage while Chris and Suiu are in the second, proving that it's unfair to compare their oxytocin levels.  That, combined with the fact that there are other relevant hormones to study, allows Shinya and Ayame to finally land an intellectual blow on Chris and Suiu and keep them in the running as a potential romantic couple after all. Chris and Suiu, feeling equally surprised and impressed, both voice their support for the developing couple. In light of that, Science Fell in Love might soon revert back to its Kaguya-sama themed battle of wits narrative, unless another perfect couple or skeptic comes along to challenge Shinya's and Ayame's love once again. Shinya must be ready for anything and stay on his toes, just in case. He's won his latest battle, but the war goes on.

Radiant Red #2   Writer  Cherish Chen    Artist  David Lafuente, Miquel Muerto    Letterer  Diego Sanches    Publisher  Image Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      When considering what they would do if they had superpowers, almost everyone comes up with inspiring answers. The question becomes more difficult for a middle school teacher about to be homeless because of her fianc\u00e9's gambling addiction, who suddenly receives the matter-absorbing powers of a black hole. When Satomi Sone receives her Radiant Red powers, she decides to rob banks to alleviate her financial situation. Emerging hero Radiant Black tries to stop her, but the altercation soon turns deadly. Written by Cherish Chen with artwork from David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto and lettering by Diego Sanches, Radiant Red #2 by Image Comics continues Satomi's story as she reassesses her life choices.  A spinoff of the massively popular Radiant Black series, Radiant Red #2 gets into the thick of the action right from the start. Some unscrupulous yet powerful people want to meet Satomi in an abandoned steel plant. In typical bad guy fashion, Radiant Red walks right into an ambush. She quickly disposes of soon goons, who charge at her as soon as she enters. Suddenly, the creepy man she met at school in the morning appears out of the shadows, patronizingly applauding her on her battle skills. With a blinding flash, he changes into a high-tech suit and asks Satomi to call him Shift. Radiant Red clenches her fists and readily obliges.  RELATED: Image Comics' King Spawn #8 Comic Review                 Satomi has always led an uneventful life, never expecting anyone else, even her family, to exceed the limitations of her middle-class setting. When life finds a way to throw her world into disarray, Satomi goes down a darker path to claw back any semblance of control, inadvertently attracting the attention of the wrong crowd. Radiant Red #2 brings a grounded spin on the superhero genre while introducing a host of new characters that complicate things for the matter-absorbing protagonist. Writer Cherish Chen, who helped creator Kyle Higgins flesh out Satomi's character back in Radiant Black #6, is back at the helm. Between an action-heavy start and a dialogue-heavy end, Chen strikes a fine balance, weaving a narrative laced with action, intrigue, and suspense.  The fan-favorite creative team of artists David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto return to broaden the horizons of the world of Radiant Red. The stylized artwork of the book infuses dynamic energy into the panels as Radiant Red jumps into action, punching villains left, right, and center. From graffiti-laden walls to the dirty, abandoned atmosphere, the anime-esque aesthetic of the character designs works in juxtaposition with its surroundings. Muerto uses a vivid palette of colors that gives off a bright glow throughout the panels, with Radiant Red's crimson radiance overpowering every other shade. The colorful characters in a darker background place focus on the moving elements and add vibrancy to the artwork.  RELATED: Image Comics' Ghost Cage #1 Comic Review                 Despite opening with a flurry of bombastic action, Radiant Red #2 does not contribute much in the way of progression of events as the issue concentrates on building the plot before the final launch. Satomi burrows herself deeper into criminal endeavors, a world she has just scratched the surface of using her Radiant powers but is absolutely out of depth. As the crime boss makes themselves known, they use Satomi's desperation and predicament to their advantage, manipulating Radiant Red into committing one of the greatest heists of all time. Radiant Red #2 ends on a cliffhanger that not only brings new prospects for Satomi but also for the Radiant franchise as a whole.

Radiant Red #2   Writer  Cherish Chen    Artist  David Lafuente, Miquel Muerto    Letterer  Diego Sanches    Publisher  Image Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      When considering what they would do if they had superpowers, almost everyone comes up with inspiring answers. The question becomes more difficult for a middle school teacher about to be homeless because of her fianc\u00e9's gambling addiction, who suddenly receives the matter-absorbing powers of a black hole. When Satomi Sone receives her Radiant Red powers, she decides to rob banks to alleviate her financial situation. Emerging hero Radiant Black tries to stop her, but the altercation soon turns deadly. Written by Cherish Chen with artwork from David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto and lettering by Diego Sanches, Radiant Red #2 by Image Comics continues Satomi's story as she reassesses her life choices.  A spinoff of the massively popular Radiant Black series, Radiant Red #2 gets into the thick of the action right from the start. Some unscrupulous yet powerful people want to meet Satomi in an abandoned steel plant. In typical bad guy fashion, Radiant Red walks right into an ambush. She quickly disposes of soon goons, who charge at her as soon as she enters. Suddenly, the creepy man she met at school in the morning appears out of the shadows, patronizingly applauding her on her battle skills. With a blinding flash, he changes into a high-tech suit and asks Satomi to call him Shift. Radiant Red clenches her fists and readily obliges.  RELATED: Image Comics' King Spawn #8 Comic Review                 Satomi has always led an uneventful life, never expecting anyone else, even her family, to exceed the limitations of her middle-class setting. When life finds a way to throw her world into disarray, Satomi goes down a darker path to claw back any semblance of control, inadvertently attracting the attention of the wrong crowd. Radiant Red #2 brings a grounded spin on the superhero genre while introducing a host of new characters that complicate things for the matter-absorbing protagonist. Writer Cherish Chen, who helped creator Kyle Higgins flesh out Satomi's character back in Radiant Black #6, is back at the helm. Between an action-heavy start and a dialogue-heavy end, Chen strikes a fine balance, weaving a narrative laced with action, intrigue, and suspense.  The fan-favorite creative team of artists David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto return to broaden the horizons of the world of Radiant Red. The stylized artwork of the book infuses dynamic energy into the panels as Radiant Red jumps into action, punching villains left, right, and center. From graffiti-laden walls to the dirty, abandoned atmosphere, the anime-esque aesthetic of the character designs works in juxtaposition with its surroundings. Muerto uses a vivid palette of colors that gives off a bright glow throughout the panels, with Radiant Red's crimson radiance overpowering every other shade. The colorful characters in a darker background place focus on the moving elements and add vibrancy to the artwork.  RELATED: Image Comics' Ghost Cage #1 Comic Review                 Despite opening with a flurry of bombastic action, Radiant Red #2 does not contribute much in the way of progression of events as the issue concentrates on building the plot before the final launch. Satomi burrows herself deeper into criminal endeavors, a world she has just scratched the surface of using her Radiant powers but is absolutely out of depth. As the crime boss makes themselves known, they use Satomi's desperation and predicament to their advantage, manipulating Radiant Red into committing one of the greatest heists of all time. Radiant Red #2 ends on a cliffhanger that not only brings new prospects for Satomi but also for the Radiant franchise as a whole.

By Brian Cronin Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In their spotlight on bizarrely awesome comics, CSBG examines the time Superman was trapped...on MTV in the mid-80s?!                 Today, we take a look at the time Superman was trapped...on MTV in the mid-80s?!  In every installment of I Love Ya But You\u2019re Strange I spotlight strange but ultimately endearing comic stories. Feel free to e-mail me at brianc@cbr.com if you have a suggestion for a future installment! One of the strangest periods in the history of the Superman comic books was that period after Crisis on Infinite Earths but before the Man of Steel reboot, where the stories continued as if everything was normal, but everyone knew that obviously nothing major was going to go down when the continuity was going to be rebooted in a few months. The end result was a number of charming one-off stories, and also a number of really weird ones (but I mean that as a compliment). One of the weird ones appeared in Superman #421 (by Cary Bates, Curt Swan and Dave Hunt), just two issues before Alan Moore ended the series with Superman #423 (only to be re-named Adventures of Superman with #424). In this issue, Superman finds himself trapped on essentially MTV but...weirder.   RELATED: Combo Man Was Every Marvel Hero Combined... Because of Snack Food          SUPERMAN FINDS HIMSELF ON...MTV?!? I have a whole column called My Name It Ain't Nothin', about how comic books would often feature celebrities cameos but they would have to be slightly altered so that they wouldn't have to worry about possibly libeling someone famous or whatever, have SOME sort of negative outcome based on the celebrity not liking their appearance in the comic. However, you often would see satirical pieces that were clearly based on these celebrities, and yet, in Superman #421, Superman gets trapped in MTV and the parodies are so vague that you really can barely even tell that anything is intended as a parody.   For instance, it all starts when the people of Metropolis all see their televisions overrun by a single image, that of Superman trapped in \"Imp TV.\" Naturally, you would assume that this would be the work of Mister Mxyzptlk, but in reality, this time around it was Mxyzptlk's COUSIN, Nzykmulk, who was at fault, as both Superman AND Mxy are trapped in this music television magical reality, with Mxy seemingly appearing in the light up floor from Michael Jackson's \"Billie Jean,\" but so vaguely it is barely a reference....                Superman and Mxy find themselves attacked by twisted New Wave punk versions of Superman's closest friends, and I have to say, man, Lana Lang in leater forcing Mxy to eat from a dog bowl...I am sure there's SOMEbody out there who just found their own special kink....                 But that's the werid thing, of course, who is this even parodying? I get that it is a parody of New Wave/punk bands, but, like, WHO? Who dressed like that? It's so oddly generic. Wouldn't this be the PERFECT opportunity to just have Superman and Mxy attacked by slightly off brand versions of famous music videos of the era? Was it possibly a case where Bates and Swan just didn't KNOW many good examples of notable music videos? Lana Lang transforms into a monstrous creature and the cover of the magazine tries to tie that in with Michael Jackson's \"Thriller,\" but obviously that doesn't work. The funny thing, of course, is that I did a \"My Name It Ain't Nothin'\" specifically ABOUT a comic book ALL about the \"Thriller\" video that came out around the same time as this comic, but that comic, an issue of Dazzler, sure didn't shy from the comparison like this comic book does.   Then things get really weird when Perry White shows up (by \"Perry White,\" I, of course, mean a magical alternate reality version of him), and he is now sort of dressed as Rambo, only his Bandolier shoots out cigars and the cigars injure Superman (since they're magic, donchaknow)...                This is one truly outrageous comic book! RELATED: Why Superman Got Expelled to Avoid Being Vaccinated          THE OFF-BRAND MTV REFERENCES CONTINUE, WITH SOME...TERMINATOR REFERENCES, AS WELL Okay, Superman is out of commission for a while, but he comes to when he meets the MTV version of Lois Lane, who is kind of sort of supposed to look like Madonna, right? That'd gotta be what they were going for here, but boy, it really doesn't follow at ALL, does it?                 I mean, don't get me wrong, Curt Swan does a fine job with the design of this Lois Lane, but it just doesn't look like anything from actual pop culture and I'm beginning to wonder what the heck the point of this is, parody-wise. Then Clark Kent shows up and even though they specifically say that it is a New Wave reference, he really looks more like he's dressed as the Terminator. The pop culture references are getting all over the place here and all mixed up! Anyhow, Superman cleverly takes advantage of the fact that, well, come on, he looks exactly like Clark Kent, as he takes out the Clark Kent figure and takes over his identity and then gets a sneak attack victory over Nzykmulk, who made his first appearance here and ironically, is VERY similar in tone to what Alan Moore would do with Mxy a couple of months later in \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\"                 The relationship between Superman and Mxy was interesting in this comic, as they are both in danger of losing their lives, and it cause them to connect in a way they normally don't. I love the bit where Mxy admits that he now gets how Superman feels during their recurring battles.                 The issue ends with Clark Kent getting to be one of those people who love to tell you about how they don't watch television. I have an aunt who once overheard me talking about a TV show with some people at a family gathering, came over to ask us what we were talking about, with me KNOWING she was going to just use it to say she doesn't watch TV, but I figured, what the heck, so I said we were talking about a TV show and, on cue, she replied, \"Oh, I don't watch TV.\" Never change, people who don't watch TV, never change! Wait, never mind, PLEASE change!

Goodbye, Eri, the new one-shot manga from Chainsaw Man creator Tatsuki Fujimoto, is now available to read in English on VIZ's Shonen Jump website.  The new 200-page manga was released digitally through Shonen Jump website and the Shonen Jump+ app on April 10. The standalone story focuses on Yuta, a middle school student and aspiring filmmaker who screens his first movie at a school festival. The bizarre movie is mocked by most of his classmates, except for one: a mysterious girl named on Eri, who offers to be his manager and help him improve his filmmaking abilities. RELATED: Why Chainsaw Man\u2019s Latest Chapter is For Adult Readers Only The new story is the second of Fujimoto's works to be released as a Shonen Jump+ exclusive, with the first being Look Back, another one-shot that was released in 2021. The standalone manga, which told the story of two young artists who both dream of becoming famous manga creators, was one of the most popular releases in the history of Shueisha's digital manga service, earning more than 2.5 million views within its first 24 hours of release. The print edition of Look Back will be released in English from VIZ Media this fall.  While Fujimoto's standalone releases have been received with near universal critical praise, the author is still best known for his surreal shonen action series, Chainsaw Man. Set in a world where humans live alongside devils, the series tells the story of Denji, a young man who is brutally murdered but comes back to life after making a pact with his chainsaw devil pet. Now able to transform into a powerful demon with chainsaws for arms and a head, Denji is manipulated into joining the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government-backed organization that hunts down other devils. RELATED: Chainsaw Man Creator Redraws Classic Dragon Ball Cover  Chainsaw Man completed the first part of its story in late 2020. The manga is scheduled to return sometime later this year with a second part. The first part of the story was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, but like Fujimoto's recent standalone works, the second part of the series will be released as a digital exclusive through Shonen Jump+. The series is also being adapted into a TV anime by MAPPA, the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen and the on-going Attack on Titan: The Final Season. Fujimoto's manga, including Chainsaw Man and Look Back, are distributed in English by publisher VIZ Media. The anime adaptation of Chainsaw Man is set to premiere sometime before the end of the year.

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions. With no hope of relief in sight, how long can Crosby, Whitamore and Singh preserve their force against annihilation?
