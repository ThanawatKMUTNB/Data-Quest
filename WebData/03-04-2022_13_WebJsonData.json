RocketNews24 Japanese      TOP \u00bb Write for SoraNews24! FeaturedWeird Studio Ghibli Jobs      Write for SoraNews24!  SoraNews24 is always looking for new talent to join our team and help us grow. If you\u2019ve got the skills, we want to hear from you! Thanks to the efforts of our full-time staff and team of contributing writers, we\u2019ve\u00a0grown\u00a0from a site\u00a0that published\u00a0just a handful of posts\u00a0per week to one that shares\u00a0up to 20 stories\u00a0a day and receives millions of page views a\u00a0month from readers all over the world. We partner with such websites as Anime News Network, Tokyo Otaku Mode, Japan Today and Business Insider, and are always looking for new ways to grow and improve our site. If you\u2019re interested in joining our close-knit team, check out the requirements below! \u3010What\u00a0we\u2019re looking for\u3011 People who: \u2013 are passionate, prolific, professional writers who have\u00a0a knack for telling a story \u2013 keep up to date with trends and news events in Japan and Asia \u2013 have a solid\u00a0knowledge of Internet culture\u00a0and social media \u2013 can speak/read Japanese at an upper-intermediate level (JLPT level \u201cN2\u201d) or better \u2013 have a good sense of humour *We are also seeking writers who can read\u00a0Chinese or\u00a0Korean, though they must also be skilled in writing quality English-language copy and be able to communicate in Japanese at conversational level. \u3010What we\u2019re NOT looking for\u3011 People who just want to\u00a0do straight translation.\u00a0In the beginning,\u00a0SoraNews24 mostly\u00a0translated content produced by our Japanese sister-site for an English-speaking audience, but those days are long gone. Now, the majority of our content is completely original, with writers researching breaking stories all over the Japanese web\u00a0before\u00a0producing their own article in English.\u00a0Although a solid grasp of Japanese is essential, and some formal translation experience would\u00a0no doubt prove useful, we are more interested in\u00a0individuals who can turn that source material into an engaging story of their own. \u3010How to apply\u3011 If you\u2019d like to work for us, we\u2019d like you to show\u00a0us three\u00a0things: 1. Your grasp of Japanese Please send us a direct translation of the Japanese article linked below, sticking as close to the original article as you can but presenting it in a manner\u00a0that would be both suitable and entertaining for our readers: \u5317\u6d77\u9053\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u304c\u958b\u696d\uff01 \u3055\u3063\u305d\u304f\u65b0\u51fd\u9928\u5317\u6597\u99c5\u306b\u884c\u3063\u3066\u307f\u305f\u3089\u30b1\u30f3\u30b7\u30ed\u30a6\u304c\u7acb\u3063\u3066\u3066\u30d3\u30d3\u3063\u305f 2. Your skill as a writer We\u2019d also like to see an original English-language article of your own of approximately 400\u2013500 words. You can base this on an existing news story or start from scratch, it\u2019s entirely up to you, but you should use this opportunity to show us that\u2014as well as being able to tell a good story\u2014you know your lies from your lays, your brings from your takes, and your colons from your semicolons. 3. Your resume Send two copies of your resume (one in English, one in Japanese) so that we can learn a little bit about you.
