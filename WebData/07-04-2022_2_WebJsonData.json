By Ciaran McGhee Published 7 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Tribe Nine Episode 12, now streaming on Funimation. The first season of sci-fi sports anime Tribe Nine concluded as Minato Tribe finally faced the despotic Ojiro Otori in a game of Extreme Baseball. Ojiro had changed the law to make XB\u00a0even more bloody and brutal, and Minato's Saori, Haru, Kazuki and Taiga\u00a0wanted to change it back\u00a0to how it was before. This dispute revealed the central theme of the episode and the series regarding\u00a0what Extreme Baseball is supposed to be about. The game resulted\u00a0in\u00a0a triumphant finale, but not every character's story had\u00a0a happy ending.  When Ojiro Otori stood\u00a0between his ruthless second-in-command Yui Kamiki and Taiga's mentor Hanafuda Sakura, he chastised her for her poor sportsmanship and banished her from his sight. Kamiki responded by deactivating the anti-gravity technology that kept Chiyoda Tribe's castle suspended over the arena of Chiyoda City. The crumbling castle provided a stunning backdrop to the climactic final game as Kazuki and Taiga risked their safety to help Haru complete his decisive run before Ojiro could tag him. RELATED: Platinum End's Finale Reveals the Truth of the God Selection Process This finale's striking visuals exemplified the sheer fun of Extreme Baseball, foreshadowing\u00a0the episode's strongest theme. Ojiro's initial pitch was cast in glowing red light, while Haru's batting exploded\u00a0in an aura of vibrant green and blue. The falling castle and the collapsing city were also an impressive sight, with the\u00a0aura of smoke and rubble in the city animated with so much detail as to make the impending threat palpable.                  When Ojiro beat Kazuki in hand-to-hand combat, Taiga\u00a0asked him if it was \"fun\" beating everyone on his own.\u00a0Ojiro tried to tag Haru, but Taiga punched him to the ground. Ojiro\u00a0was so distracted that he failed to notice a train emerging from the smoke behind him, but\u00a0Kazuki stood in front of it\u00a0to protect him. This would of course\u00a0prove fatal for the pair\u00a0in real life, but Tribe Nine characters have been shown to be supernaturally durable by the laws of animated physics. Both Eiji Todoroki and Kiyoshiro Haneda, for example, somehow apparently survived\u00a0their own explosions. The episode flashed back to Kazuki and Ojiro's childhood. The two promised to join\u00a0the same tribe, but Kazuki joked that Ojiro would just be his substitute. Kazuki often mocked Taiga throughout the series, but this boastful joke was very Taiga-esque. This playful approach to XB and how much Kazuki had changed since then reinforced the ultimate theme of the episode: Extreme Baseball is supposed to be fun, not a violent tool. Haru also flashed back to a memory of beating the late\u00a0Shun Kamiya in a practice\u00a0lesson. Kamiya taught\u00a0Haru about the love of playing XB -- a\u00a0philosophy that Saori taught Kamiya\u00a0in his days as \"The Destroyer,\"\u00a0and which Kamiya tried to teach Ojiro in their fateful final encounter.                  When Kazuki awoke, he symbolically offered to join Chiyoda Tribe.\u00a0Revitalized, Ojiro tried again to tag Haru. Playing with a teammate again, Ojiro couldn't help but smile.\u00a0Haru said, \"XB is fun! Do you feel it too?\" and Ojiro's face fell into a frown of shock before he smiled again: he could no longer deny that Minato's way of playing XB and having fun with teammates was superior to his violent and solitary\u00a0mission to be the best.\u00a0As Ojiro and Haru fought, Kazuki and Taiga punched away the falling debris. The tribes finally stopped fighting for their lives, but the collapsing city made no such promise. RELATED: How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment What are\u00a0the real-life applications of the episode's message that Extreme Baseball should be fun? Perhaps it\u00a0represents\u00a0being able to enjoy sports and television without becoming obsessed like Ojiro was. Maybe it's a simple reminder for people not to take life so\u00a0seriously that they\u00a0can't\u00a0appreciate it, just as Haru appreciated the game even as the city fell around him. Ojiro's fixation on obtaining ultimate strength could also be seen as perfectionism, and Minato's enjoyment of XB for the game's own sake\u00a0in spite of the potential outcome could represent being able to accept failure.                  Haru ultimately defeated Ojiro, and after the wreckage settled, Kazuki rescued his old partner. Kazuki once again joked about Ojiro being his substitute, showing that he was finally ready to have fun with XB again. In a cruel last-minute twist, more debris appeared to fall where\u00a0Kazuki and Ojiro were, and a news report\u00a0implied they hadn't been heard from\u00a0since. This seemed abrupt, but the Tribe Nine project is set to include a video game and Webtoon comic series, which may well provide some answers as to the duo's\u00a0fate. Haru told Saori in Episode 11 that he had romantic feelings for her -- a refreshing moment that defied the anime trope\u00a0of characters not being able to get the words out. The epilogue of Episode 12 revealed that she turned him down off-screen, as\u00a0Taiga awkwardly mumbled some uncharacteristically straightforward words of sympathy. Haru responded that he understood Saori's feelings\u00a0and still wanted to keep honestly expressing his own\u00a0in the future.\u00a0It was positive that the episode showed Haru moving on from his disappointment in a healthy way and accepting Saori's response. This positive tone\u00a0continued as\u00a0the final shot showed Minato Tribe playing\u00a0once again in the Minato City arena. The team smiled on as Haru stepped up to the bat and echoed the mission statement of the series: \"Let's play ball and have some fun!\" KEEP READING: Demon Slayer: The Entertainment District Ends on the Series' Most Hopeful Note      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                   Dragon Ball Super Artist Draws New Super Hero Characters in Classic Style    Related Topics  Anime Tribe Nine     About The Author                       Ciaran McGhee                                         (65 Articles Published)   Ciaran McGhee is a critic and writer with articles in such publications as GamingBible, and Lancaster's SCAN.

Here's why Brotherhood's Scar would dominate his old counterpart.     By Daniel McMahon Published 14 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The 2003 anime version of\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist is drastically and dramatically different from the more faithful 2009 manga adaption,\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. These differences resulted\u00a0from\u00a0the manga's ongoing status at the time of the\u00a0first\u00a0series, resulting in an anime-original storyline for the latter half of the plot. One of the biggest differences is the anti-hero Scar and how he grows throughout the respective series. By the end of FMAB, it's clear that Scar has transformed into a man\u00a0who surpasses his old self in every way. Here's how. RELATED: Why Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa Had the Worst Possible Ending                   In Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003, Scar\u2019s brother attempted to bring back his deceased love using the forbidden art of human transmutation. This act failed, however, and created the homunculus known as Lust which would serve to be the impetus for the brother\u2019s banishment. Later on during\u00a0the Ishvalan Civil War\u00a0he sought the Grand Arcanum, an ancient forbidden alchemy that was taught to Scar\u2019s brother by the Ishvalan Exile. By drawing a series of transmutation circles on one\u2019s body, they are able to take the souls of either the deceased or living and use them to create a Philosopher\u2019s Stone inside themselves. Unlike alchemists who go through three distinct processes to transmute objects, Scar is unique in that he chooses to only use the first two processes. The three processes of alchemy are 1) understanding of the molecular composition, 2) destruction of the material and 3) reconstruction into a new form. Ishvalans are philosophically opposed to the third process, believing it is heretical to make god\u2019s creations better than they already were. RELATED:\u00a0How Tall Is Fullmetal Alchemist's Edward Elric - and How Did He Grow Taller?                  When Scar and his brother try to escape the war, State Alchemist Kimblee intercepts\u00a0them, giving Scar his eponymous injury and blowing off his right arm. Before dying,\u00a0his brother attaches his own arm, tattooed with the Grand Arcanum, onto Scar and tells him to continue living. This procedure saved Scar\u2019s life and gifted him with his most dangerous weapon: an arm that can perform the first two processes of alchemic transmutation. With this newfound power of destruction, Scar began a campaign as the \u201cwrath of God\u201d to massacre Amestrian soldiers and State Alchemists by destroying their organs with his right hand. Scar later manipulates the people of Liore into helping him create a giant transmutation circle throughout their city. In a final battle against Alphonse and Scar at the end of 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist, Kimblee uses the last of his strength to transmute Alphonse into a living bomb while Scar is fatally shot by an Amestrian soldier. Recognizing his imminent demise, Scar uses the last of his power to complete the city-wide transmutation circle he drew and create a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse to save him. This circle ended up killing hundreds if not thousands of Amestrian soldiers and alchemists, and would serve to horrify the man Scar became in Brotherhood. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Teases New Movie for Series' 20th Anniversary                  In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Scar lost his arm in an almost identical way. State Alchemist Kimblee ambushed a group of Ishvalans and blew them up with his explosive alchemy.\u00a0Scar was left in shock from blood loss due to losing his right arm in the blast, so his brother attached his own arm to young Scar. This gave\u00a0him the ability to access the first two processes of alchemy merely by touching it. As Ed notes later in the series, whether Scar chooses to admit it or not, he is a very skilled alchemist and\u00a0highly\u00a0intelligent to be able to recognize the materials of what he transmutes at a glance. Like his 2003 counterpart, Scar went on a quest of vengeance to kill State Alchemists and Amestrian soldiers. An important difference, however, is that\u00a0he is not trapping their souls anymore in FMAB. This likewise signals a\u00a0change in character,\u00a0owing to his more compassionate portrayal. As Scar's quest goes on and he begins killing high-ranking military offers, Ed and Al confront him\u00a0over his actions. Winry catches up to the three and learns that Scar was the one who killed her parents, leading her to hold him at gunpoint. Ed leaps over Scar in front of Winry, shielding her from\u00a0his grasp. Reminded of his brother's courage in shielding him\u00a0when Kimblee attacked, Scar began to have a change of heart over the extremity of his mission. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer                   Scar later continues his journey with Yoki, Marcoh and\u00a0Mei Chang.\u00a0This part of his character arc in FMAB is notable for his increasingly relaxed demeanor and decrease in\u00a0acts of violence against random Amestrian soldiers. After\u00a0fighting with Ed and Al in the North\u00a0City,\u00a0Scar is wounded and captured. He is bandaged by Winry and introduced to Major Miles, a fellow Ishvalan who is trying to change the military's perception of Ishvalans from the inside. Scar is\u00a0visibly touched by speaking to Miles and\u00a0begins to truly\u00a0scrutinize\u00a0whether\u00a0his actions are for the greater good. All of Scar's character growth would\u00a0pay dividends in\u00a0his ultimate fight\u00a0against King Bradley. After stabbing and pinning Scar's right arm to the ground,\u00a0the King attempts to finish\u00a0him off by thrusting his sword into Scar as he is lying on his back unarmed. If this were\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003's Scar, he would've died right here. However, Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0managed to turn the tides by surprising both Bradley and the audience. In the interim leading up to the Promised Day, Scar tattooed his left arm with the symbols of\u00a0all three alchemic processes. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  This allowed\u00a0Scar to transmute the ground below him into a jagged mass of rocks that served to pierce Bradley's dominant right arm and throw him completely off guard. Instead of relying on the vast network of Philosopher's Stones that ran underground -- as they had unknowingly been doing since Amestria's inception -- Scar, using his knowledge of alkahestry, activates a reversed transmutation circle to allow alchemists to tap into the power of tectonics. If the two Scars were to ever fight, it would result in\u00a0Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0coming out on top using a lethal combination of his destructive and constructive alchemy.\u00a0The emotional growth Scar undergoes in FMAB\u00a0would make him pity the man he was in the 2003 adaptation. Brotherhood's Scar would even compare his old self to Bradley, likely saying they are both using giant human transmutation circles for petty reasons. Using the wisdom and patience acquired from being an Ishvalan monk, Fullmetal Alchemist:\u00a0Brotherhood's Scar would not only incapacitate his old self but likely also attempt to reason with him. If words fail, he\u00a0still has the unique ability to use his left arm to transmute the surroundings of his old self, incapacitating\u00a0his opponent and his arm, then\u00a0use his own right arm\u00a0for the finishing blow.

In a final battle against Alphonse and Scar at the end of 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist, Kimblee uses the last of his strength to transmute Alphonse into a living bomb while Scar is fatally shot by an Amestrian soldier. Recognizing his imminent demise, Scar uses the last of his power to complete the city-wide transmutation circle he drew and create a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse to save him. This circle ended up killing hundreds if not thousands of Amestrian soldiers and alchemists, and would serve to horrify the man Scar became in Brotherhood. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Teases New Movie for Series' 20th Anniversary                  In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Scar lost his arm in an almost identical way. State Alchemist Kimblee ambushed a group of Ishvalans and blew them up with his explosive alchemy.\u00a0Scar was left in shock from blood loss due to losing his right arm in the blast, so his brother attached his own arm to young Scar. This gave\u00a0him the ability to access the first two processes of alchemy merely by touching it. As Ed notes later in the series, whether Scar chooses to admit it or not, he is a very skilled alchemist and\u00a0highly\u00a0intelligent to be able to recognize the materials of what he transmutes at a glance. Like his 2003 counterpart, Scar went on a quest of vengeance to kill State Alchemists and Amestrian soldiers. An important difference, however, is that\u00a0he is not trapping their souls anymore in FMAB. This likewise signals a\u00a0change in character,\u00a0owing to his more compassionate portrayal. As Scar's quest goes on and he begins killing high-ranking military offers, Ed and Al confront him\u00a0over his actions. Winry catches up to the three and learns that Scar was the one who killed her parents, leading her to hold him at gunpoint. Ed leaps over Scar in front of Winry, shielding her from\u00a0his grasp. Reminded of his brother's courage in shielding him\u00a0when Kimblee attacked, Scar began to have a change of heart over the extremity of his mission. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer                   Scar later continues his journey with Yoki, Marcoh and\u00a0Mei Chang.\u00a0This part of his character arc in FMAB is notable for his increasingly relaxed demeanor and decrease in\u00a0acts of violence against random Amestrian soldiers. After\u00a0fighting with Ed and Al in the North\u00a0City,\u00a0Scar is wounded and captured. He is bandaged by Winry and introduced to Major Miles, a fellow Ishvalan who is trying to change the military's perception of Ishvalans from the inside. Scar is\u00a0visibly touched by speaking to Miles and\u00a0begins to truly\u00a0scrutinize\u00a0whether\u00a0his actions are for the greater good. All of Scar's character growth would\u00a0pay dividends in\u00a0his ultimate fight\u00a0against King Bradley. After stabbing and pinning Scar's right arm to the ground,\u00a0the King attempts to finish\u00a0him off by thrusting his sword into Scar as he is lying on his back unarmed. If this were\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003's Scar, he would've died right here. However, Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0managed to turn the tides by surprising both Bradley and the audience. In the interim leading up to the Promised Day, Scar tattooed his left arm with the symbols of\u00a0all three alchemic processes. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  This allowed\u00a0Scar to transmute the ground below him into a jagged mass of rocks that served to pierce Bradley's dominant right arm and throw him completely off guard. Instead of relying on the vast network of Philosopher's Stones that ran underground -- as they had unknowingly been doing since Amestria's inception -- Scar, using his knowledge of alkahestry, activates a reversed transmutation circle to allow alchemists to tap into the power of tectonics. If the two Scars were to ever fight, it would result in\u00a0Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0coming out on top using a lethal combination of his destructive and constructive alchemy.\u00a0The emotional growth Scar undergoes in FMAB\u00a0would make him pity the man he was in the 2003 adaptation. Brotherhood's Scar would even compare his old self to Bradley, likely saying they are both using giant human transmutation circles for petty reasons. Using the wisdom and patience acquired from being an Ishvalan monk, Fullmetal Alchemist:\u00a0Brotherhood's Scar would not only incapacitate his old self but likely also attempt to reason with him. If words fail, he\u00a0still has the unique ability to use his left arm to transmute the surroundings of his old self, incapacitating\u00a0his opponent and his arm, then\u00a0use his own right arm\u00a0for the finishing blow.

By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It Season 2, Episode 1, now streaming on Crunchyroll. Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming edutainment anime series starring the lovestruck grad students Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya, who are determined to use the power of science to ascertain whether their mutual affection is genuine. Only hard data can prove their love, or so they believed in Season 1. Season 2 has now begun, and the premiere episode calls into question everything Shinya and Ayame hold dear about their relationship and their scientific methods. The new power couple, Fujiwara Suyiu and Chris Florette, recently challenged them to a battle of what true love really is, transforming the series into a true battle shonen title in the process.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts How Science Fell In Love Became A Battle Shonen                  During the events of Season 1, Science Fell in Love was best compared to other \"battle of wits\" romantic series such as Kaguya-sama: Love is War -- which, incidentally, is also returning in the Spring 2022 anime season. Kaguya-Sama and Science Fell in Love both feature intelligent but romantically clueless main lovers who would rather use tricks, traps and exhaustive analysis than tried-and-true romantic gestures, since these characters are too smart (and too proud) for their own good. However, unlike Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki, Shinya and Ayame aren't trying to force a confession out of the other, although they are willing to question and disprove each other's methods during these experiments. And while the cool-headed kuudere Yukimura Shinya often tries to keep the lovey-dovey Ayame at bay, he certainly loves her back, and she is more her teammate than her rival. So, they need an external foe to face, and Season 2 gives them one -- the Chris-Suiu pair. Shinya and Ayame are no longer merely testing each other's theories or questioning their worthiness in this relationship. They now have a shonen-style rivalry on their hands, complete with Dragon Ball Z-inspired visuals and even a combat system to match. Chris and his playful sadodere girlfriend Suiu are a real power couple who don't feel like they need to prove anything at all, and they have superior oxytocin levels as well. In Season 2's first episode, for example, Shinya and Ayame took on the Chris-Suiu pair in a series of experiments, only to get trounced by the lab results. Their oxytocin levels can't compare to Chris and Suiu's, and Chris even questions the validity of Ayame and Shinya's entire relationship. Now Ayame and Shinya have a rival party to prove themselves to, and as shonen underdogs, they'll have to get resourceful and fight hard against a foe that has all the advantages. This man-vs-man conflict changes the tone of Science Fell in Love, although it's not clear how long that might last. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship The Future Of Science Fell In Love                  So far, it's hard to say whether this new two-vs-two rivalry will define most of Science Fell in Love's second season or if this shonen-style rivalry will only last for one or two episodes before the story moves on to something entirely different. Chris and Suiu might become major players in Season 2 as a well-established couple to challenge the Shinya-Ayame pair, but they might just as easily fade into the background to make room for other new characters to be introduced and interact with the protagonists. Either way, Science Fell in Love has the potential to continue its shonen battle theme, and it's possible that Chris and Suiu are merely the first couple of several to challenge Shinya and Ayame. Season 1 kept itself confined to the main characters, but it's time to expand the scope of the story, and Ayame and Shinya already got a taste of what it's like to compare their budding romance with that of other couples. They were humiliated in the season's first battle, but given how curious and persistent these lab lovebirds are, this challenge will likely motivate them to keep it up and fight more romantic battles in the future until they can score a decisive victory. Science is more than lab coats and beakers -- it's about testing and challenging data, exploring new ideas, comparing things and more. Combined with concrete battle systems such as comparing oxytocin levels, this may allow Science Fell in Love to permanently alter its narrative in Season 2 and leave behind the Kaguya-style antics of Season 1. Now is the time to challenge Ayame and Shinya in new ways, and they appear eager for that challenge. They'll take on all comers to calculate which couple is truly the best.

By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It Season 2, Episode 1, now streaming on Crunchyroll. Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming edutainment anime series starring the lovestruck grad students Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya, who are determined to use the power of science to ascertain whether their mutual affection is genuine. Only hard data can prove their love, or so they believed in Season 1. Season 2 has now begun, and the premiere episode calls into question everything Shinya and Ayame hold dear about their relationship and their scientific methods. The new power couple, Fujiwara Suyiu and Chris Florette, recently challenged them to a battle of what true love really is, transforming the series into a true battle shonen title in the process.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts How Science Fell In Love Became A Battle Shonen                  During the events of Season 1, Science Fell in Love was best compared to other \"battle of wits\" romantic series such as Kaguya-sama: Love is War -- which, incidentally, is also returning in the Spring 2022 anime season. Kaguya-Sama and Science Fell in Love both feature intelligent but romantically clueless main lovers who would rather use tricks, traps and exhaustive analysis than tried-and-true romantic gestures, since these characters are too smart (and too proud) for their own good. However, unlike Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki, Shinya and Ayame aren't trying to force a confession out of the other, although they are willing to question and disprove each other's methods during these experiments. And while the cool-headed kuudere Yukimura Shinya often tries to keep the lovey-dovey Ayame at bay, he certainly loves her back, and she is more her teammate than her rival. So, they need an external foe to face, and Season 2 gives them one -- the Chris-Suiu pair. Shinya and Ayame are no longer merely testing each other's theories or questioning their worthiness in this relationship. They now have a shonen-style rivalry on their hands, complete with Dragon Ball Z-inspired visuals and even a combat system to match. Chris and his playful sadodere girlfriend Suiu are a real power couple who don't feel like they need to prove anything at all, and they have superior oxytocin levels as well. In Season 2's first episode, for example, Shinya and Ayame took on the Chris-Suiu pair in a series of experiments, only to get trounced by the lab results. Their oxytocin levels can't compare to Chris and Suiu's, and Chris even questions the validity of Ayame and Shinya's entire relationship. Now Ayame and Shinya have a rival party to prove themselves to, and as shonen underdogs, they'll have to get resourceful and fight hard against a foe that has all the advantages. This man-vs-man conflict changes the tone of Science Fell in Love, although it's not clear how long that might last. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship The Future Of Science Fell In Love                  So far, it's hard to say whether this new two-vs-two rivalry will define most of Science Fell in Love's second season or if this shonen-style rivalry will only last for one or two episodes before the story moves on to something entirely different. Chris and Suiu might become major players in Season 2 as a well-established couple to challenge the Shinya-Ayame pair, but they might just as easily fade into the background to make room for other new characters to be introduced and interact with the protagonists. Either way, Science Fell in Love has the potential to continue its shonen battle theme, and it's possible that Chris and Suiu are merely the first couple of several to challenge Shinya and Ayame. Season 1 kept itself confined to the main characters, but it's time to expand the scope of the story, and Ayame and Shinya already got a taste of what it's like to compare their budding romance with that of other couples. They were humiliated in the season's first battle, but given how curious and persistent these lab lovebirds are, this challenge will likely motivate them to keep it up and fight more romantic battles in the future until they can score a decisive victory. Science is more than lab coats and beakers -- it's about testing and challenging data, exploring new ideas, comparing things and more. Combined with concrete battle systems such as comparing oxytocin levels, this may allow Science Fell in Love to permanently alter its narrative in Season 2 and leave behind the Kaguya-style antics of Season 1. Now is the time to challenge Ayame and Shinya in new ways, and they appear eager for that challenge. They'll take on all comers to calculate which couple is truly the best.

The webtoon's\u00a0rise to glory is rooted\u00a0in turning a virtually worthless hunter into a peerless, overpowered monarch commanding thousands of shadows.

RELATED: Fantasy Manhwa With the Most Intricate & Unique Magic Systems The Lone Necromancer Focuses On The Greatness Of Necromancy                  When Seongwu returns to college after accomplishing his obligatory national service in the military, a mysterious phenomenon forces his entire university to choose a role. Seongwu hesitatingly chooses the necromancer after noticing the numerous stars it has. Almost immediately after, his classroom is attacked by goblins, which he bravely defeats with the little equipment available to him. He then discovers his ability to summon the undead and command them to fight for him -- an ability that will be of great use as various quests\u00a0pit his entire university against monsters. The Lone Necromancer\u00a0mixes action with horror as it puts its characters in a game set in hard mode. Seongwu and company are literally thrown into chaos with barely any information, and they must struggle with everything they have if they want to survive. Fortunately, their hell greatly resembles RPGs, so they at least have some inkling of what to do next. Seongwu's calm-headedness allows him to bring the most out of his necromancy, resulting in badass action scenes and laudable power-ups.

When his favorite novel, which he has been following for years, comes to an end, he receives a weird message from the author thanking him for being the sole reader and supporter from start to finish. He downloads what seems to be the full manuscript of the web novel -- and then a drastic change starts to occur. The apocalyptic world his web novel is set in suddenly starts overlapping with his reality. Omniscient Reader\u00a0may have realized a web novel, but it features a slew of game mechanics. This webtoon features numerous higher beings known as Constellations who generously spend on their Incarnations.

They\u00a0can also be awarded coins, which they can spend on a handy shop that sells various game-changing equipment.\u00a0One of the most efficient ways of earning these coins is to accomplish the missions and survive their hellish events.

Here\u2019s how that happened, and how old she really is.     By Marc York Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    In 2013,\u00a0the\u00a0Dragon Ball gave Trunks a new love interest in the form of Mai. However, in Dragon Ball Super, the two are shown having grown up together and developing a strong bond. That initially seems wholesome, but there's one thing fans can\u2019t help but ask about: Mai's actual age. In truth, Mai is an adult much older than Trunks; a wish on the Dragon Balls reverted Mai to a child around Trunks' age. But her actual age is a little more difficult to answer, especially considering how the timeline works in\u00a0Dragon Ball Super. Determining Mai's real age will require an understanding of\u00a0Dragon Ball's\u00a0timeline, and where Mai falls in it.  RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: King Kai's Wish Makes More Sense Censored                  Mai's first given age comes from Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. Before the events of the movie, the Pilaf Gang used the Dragon Balls to restore their youth, but they were made too young and turned into children.\u00a0Despite that, when asked about her age, Mai thoughtlessly answers \"41 in March.\" Because Battle of the Gods takes place in 778, roughly four years after the Buu Saga (Age 774), Mai's presumed year of birth is 737. What's peculiar about\u00a0Mai's given age is that it's around\u00a0the same age as Goku. At this point in Dragon Ball\u00a0continuity, Goku was presumed to have also been born in Age 737. Despite that, by the time they meet in Age 749, Goku looks no older than 12, which adds up, while Mai looks no younger than the mid-teen Bulma. It's possible Mai lied about her age, and she's actually a little older than she cares to admit. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z's Trunks Saga Would've Been Better Without Frieza Dragon Ball Super makes\u00a0this question even harder to answer. Unlike the movie, this series\u00a0begins mere months after the Buu Saga.\u00a0While Mai's comment about being in her forties doesn't make it into the anime, if it holds true at this point, then her being older than Goku (who should still only be 37 in Age 774) is more believable. In any case, it's safe to assume that, chronologically, Mai is either in her late thirties or early forties\u00a0by this point. As for Mai's age as a \"child,\" she's probably close to Trunks', if not a little older.  When she's introduced at this age, she's shown to be a little taller than the boy. That changes by Future Trunks' time, but that's more likely due to the difference in how boys and girls develop in regard to height. If this is true, then Mai should be at least 12 by Age 778. This is further backed by a bonus chapter of the\u00a0DBS\u00a0manga from 2016. In this chapter, the Pilaf Gang is shown wishing to be younger around the time Trunks was a baby. They themselves are reverted to babies by the wish. Assuming this part of the anime and manga continuity line up, it proves that Trunks and Mai are around the same age. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: The Fusion Saga's Most Shocking Plot Twists                  It's worth noting that, despite their physical ages, neither Trunks nor Mai look any older, despite entire years going by. Trunks has looked like he was 8 since Age 774. This makes sense in that year since he actually\u00a0was 8 at the time. However, by the time of the Tournament of Power (Age 780), he should be at least 14. Even\u00a0History of Trunks, which also took place in Age 780, knew to make Future Trunks look older based on his apparent age. Regardless, Trunks and Mai remain cute and marketable for\u00a0DBS. Whatever the cause of Trunks and Mai's lasting youth, they should be assumed to be around the same age following Mai's regression. She starts off in what should be her early forties but regresses to around 8-12 years old due to the wish on the Dragon Balls. This holds true whether Trunks and Mai met in Age 774 or Age 778. This doesn't explain why they still look\u00a08 to 12 years old by Age 780, but that's how it is. At the very least,\u00a0Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero\u00a0seems like it will finally make these two look as old as they should be.

Here\u2019s how that happened, and how old she really is.     By Marc York Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    In 2013,\u00a0the\u00a0Dragon Ball gave Trunks a new love interest in the form of Mai. However, in Dragon Ball Super, the two are shown having grown up together and developing a strong bond. That initially seems wholesome, but there's one thing fans can\u2019t help but ask about: Mai's actual age. In truth, Mai is an adult much older than Trunks; a wish on the Dragon Balls reverted Mai to a child around Trunks' age. But her actual age is a little more difficult to answer, especially considering how the timeline works in\u00a0Dragon Ball Super. Determining Mai's real age will require an understanding of\u00a0Dragon Ball's\u00a0timeline, and where Mai falls in it.  RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: King Kai's Wish Makes More Sense Censored                  Mai's first given age comes from Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. Before the events of the movie, the Pilaf Gang used the Dragon Balls to restore their youth, but they were made too young and turned into children.\u00a0Despite that, when asked about her age, Mai thoughtlessly answers \"41 in March.\" Because Battle of the Gods takes place in 778, roughly four years after the Buu Saga (Age 774), Mai's presumed year of birth is 737. What's peculiar about\u00a0Mai's given age is that it's around\u00a0the same age as Goku. At this point in Dragon Ball\u00a0continuity, Goku was presumed to have also been born in Age 737. Despite that, by the time they meet in Age 749, Goku looks no older than 12, which adds up, while Mai looks no younger than the mid-teen Bulma. It's possible Mai lied about her age, and she's actually a little older than she cares to admit. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z's Trunks Saga Would've Been Better Without Frieza Dragon Ball Super makes\u00a0this question even harder to answer. Unlike the movie, this series\u00a0begins mere months after the Buu Saga.\u00a0While Mai's comment about being in her forties doesn't make it into the anime, if it holds true at this point, then her being older than Goku (who should still only be 37 in Age 774) is more believable. In any case, it's safe to assume that, chronologically, Mai is either in her late thirties or early forties\u00a0by this point. As for Mai's age as a \"child,\" she's probably close to Trunks', if not a little older.  When she's introduced at this age, she's shown to be a little taller than the boy. That changes by Future Trunks' time, but that's more likely due to the difference in how boys and girls develop in regard to height. If this is true, then Mai should be at least 12 by Age 778. This is further backed by a bonus chapter of the\u00a0DBS\u00a0manga from 2016. In this chapter, the Pilaf Gang is shown wishing to be younger around the time Trunks was a baby. They themselves are reverted to babies by the wish. Assuming this part of the anime and manga continuity line up, it proves that Trunks and Mai are around the same age. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: The Fusion Saga's Most Shocking Plot Twists                  It's worth noting that, despite their physical ages, neither Trunks nor Mai look any older, despite entire years going by. Trunks has looked like he was 8 since Age 774. This makes sense in that year since he actually\u00a0was 8 at the time. However, by the time of the Tournament of Power (Age 780), he should be at least 14. Even\u00a0History of Trunks, which also took place in Age 780, knew to make Future Trunks look older based on his apparent age. Regardless, Trunks and Mai remain cute and marketable for\u00a0DBS. Whatever the cause of Trunks and Mai's lasting youth, they should be assumed to be around the same age following Mai's regression. She starts off in what should be her early forties but regresses to around 8-12 years old due to the wish on the Dragon Balls. This holds true whether Trunks and Mai met in Age 774 or Age 778. This doesn't explain why they still look\u00a08 to 12 years old by Age 780, but that's how it is. At the very least,\u00a0Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero\u00a0seems like it will finally make these two look as old as they should be.

By Marla A\u00f1onuevo Published 2 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Anime and manga fans know that in any franchise, there's usually a character dubbed with the title \"best boy\" or \"best girl.\" The much-awaited hit comedy Spy x Family by Endo Tatsuya features a roster of eccentric characters whose mix-and-match personalities contribute greatly to the story's hilarity. Among these characters is the telepathic child of the Forger family, Anya, who\u00a0has rightfully earned her spot as the best girl of the series. Anya is introduced immediately in the story after Loid arrives at the orphanage searching for a child to adopt for his mission. Loid estimates that Anya is only four or five years old at most, but she tells him that she is six after hearing his thoughts about needing a six-year-old. She also fakes her intelligence level to fit the necessary requirements for Loid's mission. She possesses excellent street smarts and has a quick-thinking wit, but she hates studying. Given this fact, she usually resorts to reading\u00a0the other students' minds to get through her tests.  RELATED:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series' Anniversary                  On the surface, Anya is a cheerful-looking kid, but she has a dark past. She was formerly called \"Test Subject 007\" -- a product of an unknown research experiment where she was not treated like a child at all. Eventually, after escaping, she ended up in the orphanage but has been fostered in and out four times. Anya seems to have a knack for exciting situations, and as such, she wants to go with Loid after finding out he's a spy. She takes that excitement level up another notch after scheming to play matchmaker with Loid and Yor after\u00a0discovering that Yor is an assassin. There's no doubt that Anya is adorable, but her wide variety of facial expressions adds to her charm as a character. Endo Tatsuya does a fantastic job of expressing the characters' emotions and reactions in general\u00a0-- although many would say Anya has the best ones. Throughout the series, her face probably has the most range. There's the infamous \"heh\" expression, the utterly shocked face when Damian says he doesn't care about her dog, her crying or on the verge of tears expression and many more. For some fans, Anya's reactions are what one would consider \"meme-worthy.\" As a telepath, Anya is the only one who knows about everyone's secret identities. Since she knows what's really going on, she helps out as much as she can\u00a0to keep the Forger family alive. Each member of the family has their respective objectives for wanting to keep the family together\u00a0-- and in Anya's case, the thought of having a spy dad and an assassin mom was initially incredibly appealing. However, ultimately, Anya probably just wants a family of her own. RELATED:\u00a0Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                  Anya therefore does her absolute best to keep her parents' secret identities safe from each other. If Loid is busy with spy work or Yor is busy with her assassin job, Anya is there to distract the other parent. She even goes as far as risking her own life to prevent the family from separating.\u00a0Sometimes, she misunderstands or misreads the situation, potentially making matters worse -- but of course, things manage to comically work out in the protagonists' favor. The story of Spy x Family isn't over, and there's still a lot of room for Anya's character to grow. After all, she's just a child. Moreover, Loid's mission would not have moved forward if it weren't for her. Ultimately, one of the key factors to world peace is a telepathic child who loves peanuts -- and while that doesn't sound very reassuring, with a girl like Anya around, the world\u00a0will\u00a0be just fine.

By Marla A\u00f1onuevo Published 2 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Anime and manga fans know that in any franchise, there's usually a character dubbed with the title \"best boy\" or \"best girl.\" The much-awaited hit comedy Spy x Family by Endo Tatsuya features a roster of eccentric characters whose mix-and-match personalities contribute greatly to the story's hilarity. Among these characters is the telepathic child of the Forger family, Anya, who\u00a0has rightfully earned her spot as the best girl of the series. Anya is introduced immediately in the story after Loid arrives at the orphanage searching for a child to adopt for his mission. Loid estimates that Anya is only four or five years old at most, but she tells him that she is six after hearing his thoughts about needing a six-year-old. She also fakes her intelligence level to fit the necessary requirements for Loid's mission. She possesses excellent street smarts and has a quick-thinking wit, but she hates studying. Given this fact, she usually resorts to reading\u00a0the other students' minds to get through her tests.  RELATED:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series' Anniversary                  On the surface, Anya is a cheerful-looking kid, but she has a dark past. She was formerly called \"Test Subject 007\" -- a product of an unknown research experiment where she was not treated like a child at all. Eventually, after escaping, she ended up in the orphanage but has been fostered in and out four times. Anya seems to have a knack for exciting situations, and as such, she wants to go with Loid after finding out he's a spy. She takes that excitement level up another notch after scheming to play matchmaker with Loid and Yor after\u00a0discovering that Yor is an assassin. There's no doubt that Anya is adorable, but her wide variety of facial expressions adds to her charm as a character. Endo Tatsuya does a fantastic job of expressing the characters' emotions and reactions in general\u00a0-- although many would say Anya has the best ones. Throughout the series, her face probably has the most range. There's the infamous \"heh\" expression, the utterly shocked face when Damian says he doesn't care about her dog, her crying or on the verge of tears expression and many more. For some fans, Anya's reactions are what one would consider \"meme-worthy.\" As a telepath, Anya is the only one who knows about everyone's secret identities. Since she knows what's really going on, she helps out as much as she can\u00a0to keep the Forger family alive. Each member of the family has their respective objectives for wanting to keep the family together\u00a0-- and in Anya's case, the thought of having a spy dad and an assassin mom was initially incredibly appealing. However, ultimately, Anya probably just wants a family of her own. RELATED:\u00a0Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                  Anya therefore does her absolute best to keep her parents' secret identities safe from each other. If Loid is busy with spy work or Yor is busy with her assassin job, Anya is there to distract the other parent. She even goes as far as risking her own life to prevent the family from separating.\u00a0Sometimes, she misunderstands or misreads the situation, potentially making matters worse -- but of course, things manage to comically work out in the protagonists' favor. The story of Spy x Family isn't over, and there's still a lot of room for Anya's character to grow. After all, she's just a child. Moreover, Loid's mission would not have moved forward if it weren't for her. Ultimately, one of the key factors to world peace is a telepathic child who loves peanuts -- and while that doesn't sound very reassuring, with a girl like Anya around, the world\u00a0will\u00a0be just fine.

By Marc York Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 has officially wrapped, and on a chilling note. Eren Yeager, in his enormous Founding Titan form, has finally made landfall with his legion of Wall Titans. Even the combined military might of the entire world is powerless to stop the coming onslaught. Meanwhile, Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, although they obviously won't make it before a sizeable chunk of the human population beyond Paradis Island is trampled. However, this is all supposed to end, it certainly won't be pretty. What's really bothering fans, though, is that they won't be able to see the stunning conclusion until 2023.  With another year to go before Attack on Titan finally truly concludes, anime-only viewers are left to wonder about a lot of things. One would think that all of the major questions of AOT would have been answered by now. Anything along the lines of \"Eren starts the Rumbling\" sounds like it would be the ultimate spoiler for the series. Despite that, however, there are still things left unanswered that people want to know about. Before Attack on Titan can conclude for real (i.e., no more \"Parts\"), it will have to at least give fans the answers they've been craving. RELATED:\u00a0Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important What is the mysterious, spine-like creature?                  Attack on Titan Episode 80, \"From You, 2,000 Years Ago,\" finally introduced the source of Titans in the world. Thousands of years ago, a young Ymir stumbled into a pool of water beneath a tree and almost drowns, However, she is intercepted by a creature swimming in the water and transformed into what is now known as the Founding Titan. In the present day, Eren, the false\u00a0inheritor of the Founding Titan, has his head shot off and almost dies. However, the same creature that saved Ymir all those millennia ago emerges from Eren's body and attaches itself to his head, thus transforming him into the new Founding Titan. Nobody is quite sure what to make of this thing. Many have likened it to the hallucigenia, a real-life organism that lived in the Cambrian Period. What it really is and where it came from baffles even some manga readers. RELATED:\u00a0How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? How can the Rumbling be stopped?                  Nobody seems certain about what to do to stop the Rumbling. The united armies of the world tried firing at the Wall Titans, but there are far too many of them. Not even the united armies of the world could gather the firepower to stop millions upon millions of colossi. Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, but there's no telling how they'll do it. Armin wants to believe that they'll be able to talk some sense into Eren to get him to stop. The others are more convinced that they'll be forced to kill him. Even if Eren's friends decide to stop him with force, there's no telling how Eren himself will respond. With the powers of the Founding Titan, he doesn't even have to fight them directly; he could just brainwash them into not fighting him. Why he hasn't simply done this already remains a mystery. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll Where are Eren and Zeke?                  Eren's current whereabouts are unknown. That is to say, the location of his real body is unknown. Obviously, it has to be somewhere along the skeleton so massive that not even the word \"colossal\" can't describe it, but that's part of the problem. For one thing, much of the Founding Titan is a giant skeleton, including the nape of the neck where the Titan Shifters would normally reside. That means Eren has to be somewhere else along this massive body; for all anyone knows, he could have transformed completely into the Titan itself. Zeke's whereabouts are similarly unknown. The last anyone saw of him was in Episode 80; as Eren was turning into the Founding Titan, Zeke was apparently overtaken by the hallucigenia. That implies that, like Eren, he's located somewhere along the Founding Titan's body. It's even possible that he's become one with the Founding Titan along with Eren. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper Who will survive?                  This is the question everyone must ask even if they don't like the answer. For all of the beloved characters who have died in AOT already, there are still so many fan-favorites for whom audiences will have to wave a tearful goodbye. It hurts, but it's going to happen. It's just a question of who will, in fact, kick the bucket. Obviously, the Titan Shifters are fated to die within the next 13 years, but that doesn't mean some of them won't die in this final battle. Reiner, in particular, seems to be looking for just the right place to die. Besides the Titan Shifters, there are plenty of beloved characters with targets on their heads. Neither Jean nor Connie nor anyone else going up against Eren and his titans is safe, not even Levi. If main characters are meant to die, there's no better place than the series finale. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan's Latest Joke Has a Tragic Connection In what format will the anime conclude?                  This doesn't necessarily pertain to the narrative, but it's something a lot of people have been wondering about. Even manga readers have no idea how the anime staff is planning on handling the grand finale of AOT. Apparently, the \"Final Season\" is being divided into an additional third part. Fans have a couple of ideas for how the last chapters of AOT will be adapted. The simple answer would be to adapt the remaining chapters into more episodes. However, many fans say that the grand finale will be a feature-length film; these are only rumors, but it remains entirely plausible. It's important to remember that there are only nine chapters of AOT left to adapt. This seems like too few chapters to make the ideal 12-episode cour, but it might be just right for a film. In any case, everyone's desperate to know how everything will end for the anime.

The official Twitter account for the One Piece\u00a0confirmed that Episode 1014, entitled \"Marco's Tears! The Bond of the Whitebeard Pirates,\" will air on April 17, followed by the release of Episode 1015,\u00a0\"Straw Hat Luffy - The Man Who Will Become the Pirate King\" on April 24. Similarly, the official Twitter account for Digmon: Ghost Game confirmed that the series will also resume broadcasting new episodes on April 17 as well. The new releases will be the first episodes of each\u00a0series to air since Toei Animation was affected by a hacking incident on March 6, in which an unauthorized third party accessed the company's private network and caused a shutdown of the studio's systems, resulting in several productions being hit with indefinite delays.

The film was originally scheduled to be released on April 22 in Japan, with a North American premiere to follow sometime this summer. Goku and friends' latest theatrical outing was indefinitely delayed following the incident, and a new release date for the highly anticipated movie has yet to be announced. Production on Toei Animation's other big anime movie, One Piece Film: Red, appears to be going smoothly, as the studio has been releasing a steady stream of new information and art from the film in recent weeks. Most recently, the studio revealed full-color art for\u00a0Luffy, Nami and Zoro's new costumes. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island for a music festival for a new adventure that will focus on Red-Haired Shanks, the pirate captain who inspired Luffy to follow in his footsteps, and a new, as-yet unnamed female character, who appears to be a singer of some kind. The movie will be released in Japan on Aug. 6. Details about the film's international release have yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0One Piece: The True Nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, Explained Toei Animation was originally founded in 1948 and is one of Japan's oldest and most well-known\u00a0animation companies.

By Michael Lacerna Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The One Piece\u00a0and Digmon: Ghost Game anime have announced their return dates. The official Twitter account for the One Piece\u00a0confirmed that Episode 1014, entitled \"Marco's Tears! The Bond of the Whitebeard Pirates,\" will air on April 17, followed by the release of Episode 1015,\u00a0\"Straw Hat Luffy - The Man Who Will Become the Pirate King\" on April 24. Similarly, the official Twitter account for Digmon: Ghost Game confirmed that the series will also resume broadcasting new episodes on April 17 as well. The new releases will be the first episodes of each\u00a0series to air since Toei Animation was affected by a hacking incident on March 6, in which an unauthorized third party accessed the company's private network and caused a shutdown of the studio's systems, resulting in several productions being hit with indefinite delays.

The film was originally scheduled to be released on April 22 in Japan, with a North American premiere to follow sometime this summer. Goku and friends' latest theatrical outing was indefinitely delayed following the incident, and a new release date for the highly anticipated movie has yet to be announced. Production on Toei Animation's other big anime movie, One Piece Film: Red, appears to be going smoothly, as the studio has been releasing a steady stream of new information and art from the film in recent weeks. Most recently, the studio revealed full-color art for\u00a0Luffy, Nami and Zoro's new costumes. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island for a music festival for a new adventure that will focus on Red-Haired Shanks, the pirate captain who inspired Luffy to follow in his footsteps, and a new, as-yet unnamed female character, who appears to be a singer of some kind. The movie will be released in Japan on Aug. 6. Details about the film's international release have yet to be announced.

By Michael Lacerna Published 13 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Golden Kamuy will conclude before the end of April. As reported by Anime News Network, publisher Shueisha announced that the 312th chapter of the critically-acclaimed historical manga will be published on April 14, followed by Chapter 313 on April 21, and the series' grand finale, Chapter 314, on April 28. The final collected volumes will also be compiled before the end of summer, with Volume 29 releasing in Japan on April 19, followed by Volume 30 on June 17, and the 31st and final volume dropping on July 19. English release dates for these volumes have yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0What Historical Anime to Watch After The Heike Story  The series began publication of its final story arc last July. The arc began after series creator Satoru Noda went on a month-long hiatus to\u00a0do research and planning work on the manga's finale. Golden Kamuy is set in the early 1900s\u00a0and incorporates many real-life historical figures and events into its story. The series has been lauded for its historical accuracy and for its representation of the Ainu people, who are an indigenous population from Japan's northern regions. The manga won the prestigious Manga Taisho award in 2016 and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2018. Golden Kamuy tells the story of Saichi Sugimoto, a veteran of one of the bloodiest battles of the Russo-Japanese War, who is searching through\u00a0Japan's northern island of Hokkaido for a fabled treasure trove of gold hidden by the Ainu. Sugimoto teams up with a young girl, Asirpa, who is seeking to avenge the death of her father, who was one of the Ainu miners that originally discovered the gold. The two travel throughout Hokkaido, unraveling clues about the treasure's location while fighting other fortune\u00a0hunters who want to steal\u00a0the gold for themselves. RELATED:\u00a0To Your Eternity Releases Key Art for Anime's Second Season The series was first adapted into an anime by Geno Studio, which was one of the anime production companies that was chosen by Lucasfilm to contribute to 2021's\u00a0Star Wars: Visions anime anthology. The anime adaptation was similarly well received and ran\u00a0for two seasons in 2018. A third season was broadcast in 2020. The series will return for a fourth season this fall. Production on the fourth season is being moved over to Brains Base, the animation studio behind the anime adaptations of Assassination Classroom and To Your Eternity,\u00a0which is also scheduled to premiere a new season next fall. The Golden Kamuy manga is localized and distributed in English by VIZ Media. The first three seasons of the anime are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

By Michael Lacerna Published 13 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Golden Kamuy will conclude before the end of April. As reported by Anime News Network, publisher Shueisha announced that the 312th chapter of the critically-acclaimed historical manga will be published on April 14, followed by Chapter 313 on April 21, and the series' grand finale, Chapter 314, on April 28. The final collected volumes will also be compiled before the end of summer, with Volume 29 releasing in Japan on April 19, followed by Volume 30 on June 17, and the 31st and final volume dropping on July 19. English release dates for these volumes have yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0What Historical Anime to Watch After The Heike Story  The series began publication of its final story arc last July. The arc began after series creator Satoru Noda went on a month-long hiatus to\u00a0do research and planning work on the manga's finale. Golden Kamuy is set in the early 1900s\u00a0and incorporates many real-life historical figures and events into its story. The series has been lauded for its historical accuracy and for its representation of the Ainu people, who are an indigenous population from Japan's northern regions. The manga won the prestigious Manga Taisho award in 2016 and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2018. Golden Kamuy tells the story of Saichi Sugimoto, a veteran of one of the bloodiest battles of the Russo-Japanese War, who is searching through\u00a0Japan's northern island of Hokkaido for a fabled treasure trove of gold hidden by the Ainu. Sugimoto teams up with a young girl, Asirpa, who is seeking to avenge the death of her father, who was one of the Ainu miners that originally discovered the gold. The two travel throughout Hokkaido, unraveling clues about the treasure's location while fighting other fortune\u00a0hunters who want to steal\u00a0the gold for themselves. RELATED:\u00a0To Your Eternity Releases Key Art for Anime's Second Season The series was first adapted into an anime by Geno Studio, which was one of the anime production companies that was chosen by Lucasfilm to contribute to 2021's\u00a0Star Wars: Visions anime anthology. The anime adaptation was similarly well received and ran\u00a0for two seasons in 2018. A third season was broadcast in 2020. The series will return for a fourth season this fall. Production on the fourth season is being moved over to Brains Base, the animation studio behind the anime adaptations of Assassination Classroom and To Your Eternity,\u00a0which is also scheduled to premiere a new season next fall. The Golden Kamuy manga is localized and distributed in English by VIZ Media. The first three seasons of the anime are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

By Hilary Leung Published 7 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Requiem of the Rose King Episode 10, \"My Name Is Richard Plantagenet,\" and Episode 11, \u201cThat is my...my punishment,\u201d now streaming on Funimation. Requiem of the Rose King\u00a0utilizes dramatic irony in the best and worst way possible. Every viewer knew who Richard and Henry really were from the very first episode and could already predict the trajectory of their relationship. Unfortunately the two characters didn't know,\u00a0subsequently\u00a0falling in love without ever realizing the other's real identity. There are a lot of characters who have the same first name in this series, so it's\u00a0little wonder Richard never suspected his Henry would be\u00a0the\u00a0Henry.  When Richard found out who Henry really was in Episode 10, he was utterly destroyed. This was the man he had been willing to throw his life away to live with. Never in a million years did he think he would fall in love with his mortal enemy. The conflict between the Yorks and Lancasters has come to a close, but it does little to bring the closure Richard seeks. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King Breaks Gender Norms - But at What Cost?                  In Episode 10 of\u00a0Requiem of the Rose King,\u00a0the final battle between Lancaster and York sees Richard rush across the battlegrounds in search of King Henry. As soon as he killed Henry, the final piece to his avenging his father would be complete and he would be reunited with his beloved in their forest. Without him realizing it, Richard's vision of Joan and his father -- one attempting to lead him astray and the other attempting to guide him -- foreshadows his inner conflict. Joan taunts Richard as per usual, but this time there's a note of warning in her voice:\u00a0if he pursues this any further, he'll find that the king he seeks to kill is the same man as the one he holds close to his heart.\u00a0There's no way to tell if her intentions were genuine, but for a moment it looked as though Joan was sincerely trying to help Richard. The tension ratchets up a hundredfold when, on the other side, Henry is coming to terms with the realization that he has failed as a king. For years, he had stood to the side and watched as his people died for him and all he'd done was pray for salvation. Seeing Richard was the last straw in pushing Henry's sanity over the edge. RELATED:\u00a0Romeo \u00d7 Juliet: The Shakespeare Anime That Predates Requiem of the Rose King                  Richard's light had initially been his father; when the latter died,\u00a0his son had sunken into darkness -- but it was one he wholeheartedly embraced. When he met Henry, he found another source of light in his life, more pure and innocent but still unconditionally accepting. The problem was was that in order for Richard to fully embrace Henry, he needed to leave the hell his father's death had put him in. He believed that by killing the king, would he finally \"gain light.\" The moment when Henry confesses he\u00a0is the king of England is\u00a0powerful, and it\u00a0puts Richard in a deeper hell than before. At least with his father's death, he had a goal and it was clear what he needed to do. But what was\u00a0he supposed to do here?\u00a0A motif of drowning\u00a0has been threaded throughout Requiem of the Rose King, but\u00a0the imagery\u00a0focused on Richard being choked to death by the monsters. Episode 11's motif changes to an image of\u00a0him sinking into a pile of skeletons -- he's still a victim, but Buckingham and his father's words are now forcing him into being\u00a0a mindless killing machine as\u00a0punishment. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King Creator Shares Her The Batman Fan Art Episode 11 also has more characters revealing their true identities.\u00a0Even though Edward is revealed to be Henry's son, it hardly has the same impact on Richard that Anne's reveal did; despite Edward's attempts to court him, Richard had never really cared for him. Seeing Anne impersonating Edward and then defending him was a double whammy of betrayal for Richard, who had already -- mistakenly -- heard Anne's refusal to marry him. In Richard's eyes, the Lancasters had taken everything from him and humiliated him. There's a certain eerie and sad beauty in Edward's final scene. For him, being killed by Richard, whom he has loved, would be poetic -- romantic even. As Richard's sword sinks into Edward's body, rose petals flutter away. But the stark red of the rose petals is symbolic in another way as it promises more bloodshed in Richard's future.

Cass Clarke Mar 29, 2022                      Nitram Offers No Valuable Perspective On a Horrific, Real-Life Tragedy  Director Justin Kurzel's Nitram is somber and pointless.

By Ciaran McGhee Published 13 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Episode 26, now streaming on Funimation. Throughout\u00a0its two-part first season, How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom made an impression as an isekai with a difference. Kazuya Souma was summoned to the Kingdom of Elfrieden to be its king, and\u00a0has used his knowledge of Earth's politics to turn it into a fairer society. However, just as Souma had a moment to relax, he was called upon\u00a0for an audience with the previous king, Albert, and his wife Elisha. In the isekai's Part 2\u00a0finale, the\u00a0couple revealed a secret to Souma that completely changes the nature of his arrival.  Albert revealed that, in another time, he had made Souma prime minister instead of king. In this alternate timeline, Albert had succumbed to paranoia and suspicion, banishing Souma for crimes he did not commit. When this resulted in disaster, Elisha used her dark magic to transfer Albert's memories to his younger self so his fatal mistake would not come to pass. This resulted in the story\u00a0Realist Hero fans are familiar with --\u00a0but how \"real\" is the doomed kingdom from Albert's memories? RELATED: The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home                  Souma asked why Albert had trusted him so much when they first met, but refused to converse with him since. Albert began by recounting a familiar story of a hero being summoned from another world. The nostalgic, fairy-tale way\u00a0he described his first meeting with Souma was exemplified by appealing and strikingly stylized watercolor illustrations. However, using short animated scenes may have made this glimpse into an alternate Realist Hero story more immersive. Albert continued that this hero\u00a0was appointed prime minister rather than king, but like his familiar counterpart\u00a0had enacted policies that were popular with average people but enraged\u00a0the aristocracy. The nobles swayed Albert's judgment with false accusations until he dismissed Souma. The kingdom's enemies took advantage of his absence\u00a0to invade, and\u00a0Elfrieden collapsed. Elisha transferred\u00a0Albert's memories (and presumably her own) back in time as they were crushed by their own castle, and Albert rectified his mistake by making Souma king and allowing\u00a0him to rule as he saw fit. If receiving his future memories caused Albert to change his behavior, is there still a timeline in which he and Elisha died? When they smiled as the castle crumbled, did they feel\u00a0their deaths would have meaning, or that they weren't dying at all? Upon hearing the story, Souma's response revealed how his modern-day\u00a0perspective was shaped by science fiction, rephrasing Elisha's magical abilities as a \"time slip\" or \"time leap.\" RELATED: The Women of Realist Hero Hold Souma Accountable in Episode 24                  Souma asked about Liscia, his fianc\u00e9e and Albert and Elisha's daughter. Albert explained that this version of Liscia loved\u00a0him from afar, and lobbied unsuccessfully to overturn his dismissal. Liscia was the only member of Souma's court\u00a0whom he met even without the recruitment broadcast he couldn't make in this timeline. A brief scene of Liscia walking away was unfortunately her only appearance in the flashback. It would have been interesting to see Prime Minister Souma interact with this equally\u00a0different variant of Liscia, who was not promised as his fianc\u00e9e and did not fight for him in the civil war. Liscia had returned to Randel Castle, which Elisha pointed out was destroyed by the aristocrats in the old world. As he left, Souma took a moment to assure them\u00a0that even the old version of himself would have protected Liscia, and they may have survived the onslaught. This appeared to provide a great deal of relief for the couple, despite the fact that Liscia and the man she loved were alive and well anyway. RELATED: The Best Isekai Told From the 'Villain's' Perspective                  This relief could theoretically have been\u00a0because\u00a0the world of their memories still existed in some capacity\u00a0due to\u00a0Elisha's magic, and they wanted to believe Liscia could still be alive in it. This would make the\u00a0finale's timelines\u00a0into\u00a0a more traditional multiverse scenario. However, it is more likely\u00a0that Albert and Elisha's love for their daughter was so strong that they hated the idea of her having died -- even in a timeline that would never come to pass. Albert reminded Souma that his memories were the same as if\u00a0he had lived through the kingdom's collapse; it is unsurprising that he would not want to\u00a0believe he had memories of a time when his daughter was dead. Albert revealed the only other person\u00a0who knew about his\u00a0dark memories of the future was Duke Georg Carmine. Carmine\u00a0had lost his reputation and ultimately his life\u00a0in a secret plan to help Souma identify corrupt nobles. Souma lamented that, \"We were running along the track that had been laid out for us.\" However, there are some ways in which\u00a0this revelation defied the fatalistic\u00a0sense of powerlessness and pointlessness that often comes with prophecy stories. Souma's skill as a leader may have been a foregone conclusion to Albert and Carmine, but he\u00a0still ruled with his own judgment and creativity in both timelines. Episode 26 ended with Souma proposing outright to Liscia, and addressing his court with some words of encouragement. He may have been spurred to express his appreciation by the reminder of how close he had come to never meeting them. Realist Hero's finale may not have featured a typical multiverse, but it exemplified what makes the concept so fascinating: people\u00a0are only\u00a0a few different choices\u00a0away from a completely different life.

By Ciaran McGhee Published 13 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Episode 26, now streaming on Funimation. Throughout\u00a0its two-part first season, How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom made an impression as an isekai with a difference. Kazuya Souma was summoned to the Kingdom of Elfrieden to be its king, and\u00a0has used his knowledge of Earth's politics to turn it into a fairer society. However, just as Souma had a moment to relax, he was called upon\u00a0for an audience with the previous king, Albert, and his wife Elisha. In the isekai's Part 2\u00a0finale, the\u00a0couple revealed a secret to Souma that completely changes the nature of his arrival.  Albert revealed that, in another time, he had made Souma prime minister instead of king. In this alternate timeline, Albert had succumbed to paranoia and suspicion, banishing Souma for crimes he did not commit. When this resulted in disaster, Elisha used her dark magic to transfer Albert's memories to his younger self so his fatal mistake would not come to pass. This resulted in the story\u00a0Realist Hero fans are familiar with --\u00a0but how \"real\" is the doomed kingdom from Albert's memories? RELATED: The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home                  Souma asked why Albert had trusted him so much when they first met, but refused to converse with him since. Albert began by recounting a familiar story of a hero being summoned from another world. The nostalgic, fairy-tale way\u00a0he described his first meeting with Souma was exemplified by appealing and strikingly stylized watercolor illustrations. However, using short animated scenes may have made this glimpse into an alternate Realist Hero story more immersive. Albert continued that this hero\u00a0was appointed prime minister rather than king, but like his familiar counterpart\u00a0had enacted policies that were popular with average people but enraged\u00a0the aristocracy. The nobles swayed Albert's judgment with false accusations until he dismissed Souma. The kingdom's enemies took advantage of his absence\u00a0to invade, and\u00a0Elfrieden collapsed. Elisha transferred\u00a0Albert's memories (and presumably her own) back in time as they were crushed by their own castle, and Albert rectified his mistake by making Souma king and allowing\u00a0him to rule as he saw fit. If receiving his future memories caused Albert to change his behavior, is there still a timeline in which he and Elisha died? When they smiled as the castle crumbled, did they feel\u00a0their deaths would have meaning, or that they weren't dying at all? Upon hearing the story, Souma's response revealed how his modern-day\u00a0perspective was shaped by science fiction, rephrasing Elisha's magical abilities as a \"time slip\" or \"time leap.\" RELATED: The Women of Realist Hero Hold Souma Accountable in Episode 24                  Souma asked about Liscia, his fianc\u00e9e and Albert and Elisha's daughter. Albert explained that this version of Liscia loved\u00a0him from afar, and lobbied unsuccessfully to overturn his dismissal. Liscia was the only member of Souma's court\u00a0whom he met even without the recruitment broadcast he couldn't make in this timeline. A brief scene of Liscia walking away was unfortunately her only appearance in the flashback. It would have been interesting to see Prime Minister Souma interact with this equally\u00a0different variant of Liscia, who was not promised as his fianc\u00e9e and did not fight for him in the civil war. Liscia had returned to Randel Castle, which Elisha pointed out was destroyed by the aristocrats in the old world. As he left, Souma took a moment to assure them\u00a0that even the old version of himself would have protected Liscia, and they may have survived the onslaught. This appeared to provide a great deal of relief for the couple, despite the fact that Liscia and the man she loved were alive and well anyway. RELATED: The Best Isekai Told From the 'Villain's' Perspective                  This relief could theoretically have been\u00a0because\u00a0the world of their memories still existed in some capacity\u00a0due to\u00a0Elisha's magic, and they wanted to believe Liscia could still be alive in it. This would make the\u00a0finale's timelines\u00a0into\u00a0a more traditional multiverse scenario. However, it is more likely\u00a0that Albert and Elisha's love for their daughter was so strong that they hated the idea of her having died -- even in a timeline that would never come to pass. Albert reminded Souma that his memories were the same as if\u00a0he had lived through the kingdom's collapse; it is unsurprising that he would not want to\u00a0believe he had memories of a time when his daughter was dead. Albert revealed the only other person\u00a0who knew about his\u00a0dark memories of the future was Duke Georg Carmine. Carmine\u00a0had lost his reputation and ultimately his life\u00a0in a secret plan to help Souma identify corrupt nobles. Souma lamented that, \"We were running along the track that had been laid out for us.\" However, there are some ways in which\u00a0this revelation defied the fatalistic\u00a0sense of powerlessness and pointlessness that often comes with prophecy stories. Souma's skill as a leader may have been a foregone conclusion to Albert and Carmine, but he\u00a0still ruled with his own judgment and creativity in both timelines. Episode 26 ended with Souma proposing outright to Liscia, and addressing his court with some words of encouragement. He may have been spurred to express his appreciation by the reminder of how close he had come to never meeting them. Realist Hero's finale may not have featured a typical multiverse, but it exemplified what makes the concept so fascinating: people\u00a0are only\u00a0a few different choices\u00a0away from a completely different life.

One of the first widely spread fanfictions was a\u00a0Star Trek\u00a0story published in 1967 in a zine called\u00a0Spockanalia. While it's not\u00a0the\u00a0first fanfiction, it's one of the earliest examples of \"modern\" fanfiction.

With the development and quick evolution of the internet, fanfiction became more widely accessible by fan communities. Sites specifically for fanfiction began cropping up, usually based out of LiveJournal and other similar hosting sites. These sites allowed users to create pages that were specifically geared toward certain fandoms. During the early days, it wasn't uncommon for there to be multiple sites for just one fandom because each site would have different rules for what kind of fics were allowed. It also wasn't uncommon for some pages to have rivalries over these rules. Fanfiction has now increased in popularity alongside anime, with\u00a0Haikyu!!,\u00a0My Hero Academia and Attack on Titan\u00a0being some of the most popular franchises. RELATED: My Hero Academia Reboots as a Sports Anime for April Fools Some Famous Fanfictions                  Several\u00a0fanfictions have become especially well-known over the years, either through infamy or because they became their own officially published works. \"My Immortal\" is the former, being known as \"the worst fanfiction ever written.\" Nobody knows for sure who wrote this particular fic, but its horrid grammar, complete disregard for characterization and the author's insistence that everything be goth has made it the target of ridicule even to this day. Coming out of the\u00a0Harry Potter\u00a0fandom, the story first popped up on Fanfiction.net in 2006, centering on a girl named Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way as she attends Hogwarts. What follows is absolute chaos and confusion that could only come out of the mind of a teenager in the 2000s.

Over the span of three installments, the fic contained almost one million words, though there would be other fanfiction that would have larger word counts. In the past decade or so, publishing companies have begun taking popular works and turning them into their own stories for distribution. After is a book that started out as a One Direction fanfiction, featuring a bad-boy version of Harry Styles. Along the same line,\u00a0Fifty Shades of Grey\u00a0also got its start as fanfiction, being written for the\u00a0Twilight\u00a0fandom. These are just a few of the numerous fics-turned-book examples, a large number of which came out of the\u00a0Twilight\u00a0fandom in particular. Several authors have also gotten their start by creating fan content before moving on to bigger projects of their own. RELATED: Is Attack on Titan's Upcoming Episode Really the Finale? How to Get Started With Fanfiction                  So where can one read fanfiction? There are several sites like the aforementioned Fanfiction.net, though that site's popularity has declined due to several \"purges\" and rule changes over the years. Many writers have since migrated to Archive of Our Own and Wattpad to post their works. Tumblr\u00a0was once somewhat popular for posting fan works, and some can still be found there. The benefit of sites like AO3 is that there is a tagging system that can filter out what kind of fanfiction comes up in the search results. Tumblr has a similar tag feature, but it isn't as refined or thorough.\u00a0Anime in particular is popular on these sites, with\u00a0My Hero Academia\u00a0being one of the top three categories on AO3. Writing fanfiction is easy and doesn't take a lot of experience. It's as simple as typing or writing out a scenario with pre-established characters. There's no need to be great at writing and anyone can do it. There's no need to post it, either. Personal enjoyment is enough of a reason to write.

These are just a few of the numerous fics-turned-book examples, a large number of which came out of the\u00a0Twilight\u00a0fandom in particular. Several authors have also gotten their start by creating fan content before moving on to bigger projects of their own. RELATED: Is Attack on Titan's Upcoming Episode Really the Finale? How to Get Started With Fanfiction                  So where can one read fanfiction? There are several sites like the aforementioned Fanfiction.net, though that site's popularity has declined due to several \"purges\" and rule changes over the years. Many writers have since migrated to Archive of Our Own and Wattpad to post their works. Tumblr\u00a0was once somewhat popular for posting fan works, and some can still be found there. The benefit of sites like AO3 is that there is a tagging system that can filter out what kind of fanfiction comes up in the search results. Tumblr has a similar tag feature, but it isn't as refined or thorough.\u00a0Anime in particular is popular on these sites, with\u00a0My Hero Academia\u00a0being one of the top three categories on AO3. Writing fanfiction is easy and doesn't take a lot of experience. It's as simple as typing or writing out a scenario with pre-established characters. There's no need to be great at writing and anyone can do it. There's no need to post it, either. Personal enjoyment is enough of a reason to write.

By Louis Kemner Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, \"Isn't This Too Close?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season is here, and it brings a variety of wholesome new and returning anime with it, including Aharen-san is Indecipherable. This brand-new anime is set in a typical high school where the ordinary but kind Raido gets to know his quiet next-door neighbor in class, Aharen Reina. Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable launches a heartwarming relationship between Raido and his tiny classmate, and in the process, Aharen-san viewers should be reminded of similar anime shows such as Komi Can't Communicate, which also streams this season. However, there are a few factors setting these two high school series apart.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                  In Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, the ordinary student Raido glances at the tiny student to his left, the shy kuudere Aharen Reina, who hardly says a word in class, even when the teacher calls on her. Stranger still, when Raido speaks to her, Aharen responds with silent lip movements and little more. Raido can't tell if Aharen is really quiet, or even if she intends to be heard at all. Raido, however, is not the type to just give up on a mystery or leave a lonely person alone, as his actions during Episode 1 prove. Similar to Komi Can't Communicate's protagonist Tadano Hitohto, Raido is a plain guy with a heart of gold, and he sets the story into motion when he resolves to become Aharen's friend and have his first proper conversation with her. He must suspect that Aharen is terribly lonely, and he is proven right later in the episode. Bit by bit, Raido builds a relationship with Aharen and learns the truth: Aharen is a perfectly normal girl who wants to have friends, but she is difficult to hear, and the other girls in her middle school class thought she was weird and pushed her out of their social group. By now, Aharen is a typical anime kuudere; a soft-spoken and unexpressive character who will only express their loving side to the right person and under the right circumstances. Aharen's personality also has elements of the dandere archetype; a meek and shy character who has trouble asserting themselves, much like Komi Shoko herself. Aharen is more of a kuudere than a dandere, but she has enough dandere elements to have overlap with Komi, including having difficulty communicating with others. The series could almost be called Aharen Can't Communicate. RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  The rest of Episode 1 continues to build thematic ties with Komi Can't Communicate, which allows viewers to make some loose predictions about where the story and the character arcs may go from here. Even if Aharen is a bit more assertive and expressive than Komi, she still has a long way to go when it comes to communication, expressing her affection and making friends. The way she is now, Aharen has a tentative friendship with Raido, but the two of them have not yet figured out a pattern for their relationship, and things are in flux between them. Aharen must figure out how to balance her assertive side vs. her dandere side as a balanced kuudere, and for his part, Raido must find a way to always understand Aharen when she speaks and enable her without making her too reckless. Aharen appears somewhat impressionable in Episode 1, and if Raido isn't careful, he might accidentally encourage Aharen to go way overboard and step into megadere territory. Despite these differences though, Aharen-san is Indecipherable seems likely to follow the same basic story beats as Komi Can't Communicate, including Aharen slowly but surely gaining confidence as she discovers how to make new friends, and her life may become vastly enriched in the process. She will have Raido to thank for all this, and she may express her gratitude through sheer affection and personal loyalty, similar to how Komi eventually developed a crush on her first friend, Tadano. If so, Raido must prepare himself to become Aharen's first friend and her first boyfriend. They should both exercise caution and fully understand their own and each other's emotions before committing to anything big, however, since Aharen is just now coming out of her Komi-style shell, and she has to learn to walk before she can run. That's what Komi did, and it should serve Aharen well too.

Stranger still, when Raido speaks to her, Aharen responds with silent lip movements and little more. Raido can't tell if Aharen is really quiet, or even if she intends to be heard at all. Raido, however, is not the type to just give up on a mystery or leave a lonely person alone, as his actions during Episode 1 prove. Similar to Komi Can't Communicate's protagonist Tadano Hitohto, Raido is a plain guy with a heart of gold, and he sets the story into motion when he resolves to become Aharen's friend and have his first proper conversation with her. He must suspect that Aharen is terribly lonely, and he is proven right later in the episode. Bit by bit, Raido builds a relationship with Aharen and learns the truth: Aharen is a perfectly normal girl who wants to have friends, but she is difficult to hear, and the other girls in her middle school class thought she was weird and pushed her out of their social group. By now, Aharen is a typical anime kuudere; a soft-spoken and unexpressive character who will only express their loving side to the right person and under the right circumstances. Aharen's personality also has elements of the dandere archetype; a meek and shy character who has trouble asserting themselves, much like Komi Shoko herself. Aharen is more of a kuudere than a dandere, but she has enough dandere elements to have overlap with Komi, including having difficulty communicating with others. The series could almost be called Aharen Can't Communicate. RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  The rest of Episode 1 continues to build thematic ties with Komi Can't Communicate, which allows viewers to make some loose predictions about where the story and the character arcs may go from here. Even if Aharen is a bit more assertive and expressive than Komi, she still has a long way to go when it comes to communication, expressing her affection and making friends. The way she is now, Aharen has a tentative friendship with Raido, but the two of them have not yet figured out a pattern for their relationship, and things are in flux between them. Aharen must figure out how to balance her assertive side vs. her dandere side as a balanced kuudere, and for his part, Raido must find a way to always understand Aharen when she speaks and enable her without making her too reckless. Aharen appears somewhat impressionable in Episode 1, and if Raido isn't careful, he might accidentally encourage Aharen to go way overboard and step into megadere territory. Despite these differences though, Aharen-san is Indecipherable seems likely to follow the same basic story beats as Komi Can't Communicate, including Aharen slowly but surely gaining confidence as she discovers how to make new friends, and her life may become vastly enriched in the process. She will have Raido to thank for all this, and she may express her gratitude through sheer affection and personal loyalty, similar to how Komi eventually developed a crush on her first friend, Tadano. If so, Raido must prepare himself to become Aharen's first friend and her first boyfriend. They should both exercise caution and fully understand their own and each other's emotions before committing to anything big, however, since Aharen is just now coming out of her Komi-style shell, and she has to learn to walk before she can run. That's what Komi did, and it should serve Aharen well too.

Afam will pilot the ASW-G-35 Gundam Hajiroboshi, a mobile suit that shares many design elements with Mikazuki Augus' Gundam Barbatos from the original series. Urdr Hunt's premiere in Japan will also be accompanied by the broadcast of\u00a0a new \"Special Edition\" of the 2015 anime on Japanese TV. The new version of the show condenses its story from 50 episodes to just nine, but despite the truncated runtime, the show's producers are promising the addition of new \"animation cuts.\" The new release will also feature a new opening sequence and theme song, \"Blaze,\" which is performed by the Japanese rock band Man With a Mission.

By Gregory Segal Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The backstory of Naruto Uzumaki has influenced a plethora of characters within the battle-anime genre, and Orient\u2019s protagonist Musashi appears to be no exception. While these two characters come from very different worlds, they both grew up as outcasts within their society, contain powerful beings inside of them and have a childhood dream of conquering their adversities in an effort to prove to those around them that their assumptions were wrong. Whether Shinobu Ohtaka took direct inspiration from Masashi Kishimoto\u2019s ramen-loving ninja has yet to be uncovered. However, both of these characters share unmistakable characteristics and backstories that tie the two together.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: How Mai Became a Child Again & How Old She Really Is Growing Up As An Outcast                  On the day of his birth, Naruto became the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tails after his parents -- Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki -- sacrificed themselves to save Konoha from the Ky\u016bbi\u2019s devastating power. Orphaned, Naruto would live a lonely existence, as few of the people within his village could put aside their losses after the disaster that had taken place. Naruto would be openly ostracized, resented and feared by those around him for containing the Nine-Tails. While Musashi\u2019s parents were simple farmers rather than acting leaders within Tatsuyama, they too died shortly after their son's birth. Like Naruto, Musashi was rejected by those around him as he wandered from family to family seeking shelter. A group of his relatives eventually took him in; however, their relationship was abusive, and they would only promise Musashi respite if he was to throw stones and insults at his friend\u2019s father and his personal mentor Jisai Kanemaki. Unlike Naruto, Musashi was not rejected by those around him because of the creature contained inside of him (the Obsidian Goddess). However, both characters share the experience of becoming an outcast due to their associations. Ultimately, Musashi was forsaken because of his friendship with a Bushi warrior rather than his personality or actions. As children, both Naruto and Musashi found it difficult to understand why people had a hatred for them, as it stemmed from a fear of the unknown. RELATED: Is Samurai Flamenco Just a Failed Version of Tiger & Bunny? The Obsidian Goddess and The Nine-Tails Beast                  Currently, very little is understood about the Obsidian Goddess contained within Musashi. Whether this is a creature from another world or, like Naruto\u2019s Ky\u016bbi, a more earthly spirit, remains to be seen. However, both characters have managed to get out of a few tight situations that their skills and powers would otherwise be incapable of doing with the help of their internal companions. Within Episode 11 of Orient\u2019s first season, Musashi transformed into the Obsidian Goddess and was consequently able to force Shiro and Nanao Inukai into fleeing, despite hundreds of other Bushi being unable to do so. Naruto too has oftentimes used the Nine-Tails\u2019 chakra to outwit or outpower his opponents in an effort to get out of a sticky situation that he would usually fall folly to. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Childhood Dreams                  Musashi\u2019s dream of creating a Bushi Band and Naruto\u2019s endeavor of becoming the Hokage of Konoha village are obviously quite different. However, the two characters share the trait of using their fantasies to gain the inner strength to push through difficult situations. Despite a fierce campaign of propaganda that the Bushi are the devils of Hinomoto who will stop at nothing to destroy the nation's Kishin gods, Musashi remains convinced in his belief that they are truly good. Likewise, Naruto is committed to his dream of becoming a leader strong enough to gain the respect of his fellow villagers, regardless of the ridicule that he faces due to being a jinch\u016briki. Ultimately, while the characters might be different in their appearances, catch-phrases or overarching goals, they are at their core very similar. Musashi and Naruto have had immensely difficult childhoods, have been entrusted with a powerful creature and hold dreams that, despite others' disbelief, enable them to overcome their hardships. When Season 2 of Orient airs this summer, it will be interesting to see if Musashi\u2019s backstory will reveal further similarities with Konoha\u2019s most powerful ninja.

Despite a fierce campaign of propaganda that the Bushi are the devils of Hinomoto who will stop at nothing to destroy the nation's Kishin gods, Musashi remains convinced in his belief that they are truly good. Likewise, Naruto is committed to his dream of becoming a leader strong enough to gain the respect of his fellow villagers, regardless of the ridicule that he faces due to being a jinch\u016briki. Ultimately, while the characters might be different in their appearances, catch-phrases or overarching goals, they are at their core very similar. Musashi and Naruto have had immensely difficult childhoods, have been entrusted with a powerful creature and hold dreams that, despite others' disbelief, enable them to overcome their hardships. When Season 2 of Orient airs this summer, it will be interesting to see if Musashi\u2019s backstory will reveal further similarities with Konoha\u2019s most powerful ninja.

The Spring 2022 anime season has arrived, and it features more than a few wholesome anime series, including the brand-new Aharen-san is Indecipherable, which feels like a sister to the ongoing series Komi Can't Communicate. Both anime shows feature a heroine who has trouble speaking to others, but even so, Aharen and Komi have their differences. These slice-of-life heroines are both shy girls who can't easily form friendships or romances with the people around them, but their personalities differ on a fundamental level, which helps set Aharen-san apart. While Komi Shoko is a traditional dandere anime character, Aharen Reina is a twist on the kuudere archetype, and that makes her more compelling than ever.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  In the course of just one episode, Aharen-san is Indecipherable establishes its namesake heroine as not just a kuudere anime character like Nifuji Hirotaka or Sohma Yuki, but one who is made more complex with elements from other -dere types, too. In anime, the -dere archetypes usually describe how a character expresses their affection, with hot-headed tsunderes being prickly and defensive before opening up, kuuderes being aloof and cool-headed before opening up to their chosen love interest and so on. A kuudere in particular simply chooses to not get too involved with the people around them; they are quiet and unexpressive as a matter of preference. This sets them apart from dandere characters like Shoko, who are shy and unassertive to the point of putting themselves down out of excessive modesty or insecurity. It could be said that danderes are less in control of their behavior than kuuderes are, but Aharen Reina blurs the line between these archetypes plus adds a little more. In the series premiere, Aharen is compelling not just because of her cuteness or the humor of her silent mouth movements, but because she has the assertive nature of a kuudere combined with the insecurities of a dandere, making her something entirely new in modern anime. She is quiet and aloof by choice, as a true kuudere, and she is self-assured when she expresses affection for her new friend, her high school classmate Raido. At the same time, Aharen is insecure about her difficulty speaking to others and being heard, and she has unpleasant memories of her female classmates rejecting her offers of friendship in middle school. Aharen is \"once bitten, twice shy,\" but she is only insecure about her ability to express herself, not her worthiness as a friend. Self-doubt and self-depreciation are major symptoms of being a dandere, but Aharen lacks those. She knows she can be a good friend to someone, but the barrier of silence stands in her way. For a time, she had chosen to give up trying to overcome that obstacle, but now she's fighting to be heard, and Raido wants to listen. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                  Aharen's unusual combination of kuudere and dandere not only sets her apart in the story of Aharen-san is Indecipherable but also allows fans to make general predictions about the future of her character arc, her relationship with Raido and the story's overall tone. Fans can compare her hybrid -dere antics to similar characters such as Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi and certainly Komi Shoko from Komi Can't Communicate, to make some guesses about what she might say or do next. In Episode 1, for example, Aharen chooses to only stay in Raido's company and direct all her affection toward him, kuudere-style, which suggests that she may act jealously in future episodes if anyone else tries to be Raido's friend. Aharen isn't necessarily a petty or selfish person, but it's clear that this new friendship is an important and symbolic step for her, and she might overreact and shoo away anyone else who wants her to share Raido with them. If so, this will likely happen in a humorous rather than dramatic way, given the series' rom-com tone. It's also possible that Aharen and Raido's relationship will become romantic sooner than expected, especially given Aharen's slight megadere streak, and she might get in over her head. In that case, her dandere side may take over, and she could get flustered and retreat back into her shell, which may take Raido by surprise. Aharen isn't afraid to assertively express her affection to Raido, but once a certain point is reached, she may lose her nerve and rethink her relationship with him. She will have to determine if she has the courage to get serious with Raido and let her kuudere nature triumph over her dandere insecurities.

By Michael Lacerna Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A new poll named\u00a0Spy x Family the most anticipated anime of the season. As reported by Crunchyroll, Japan's largest entertainment review site, Filmarks, asked its readers to vote for their most anticipated new series of the spring 2022 season, which includes heavy hitters such as the second season of the popular isekai anime The Rising of the Shield Hero, the third season of the acclaimed romantic-comedy series Kaguya-sama: Love is War and the new psychological thriller Summer Time Rendering, which is being released internationally as the first Disney+ exclusive anime series. These juggernauts were all bested by the\u00a0new anime adaptation of Spy x Family, which earned almost five times as many votes as the second place winner, Kaguya-sama. Shield Hero's second season rounded out the top three.  RELATED:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary The results shouldn't surprise anyone who has paid attention to the rise of Tatsuya Endo's critically lauded\u00a0espionage comedy: since the series' launch in 2019 as an exclusive title for Shueisha's digital\u00a0\u00a0Shonen Jump+ service, the manga\u00a0has achieved a global circulation of over 12 million copies. Endo's light-hearted take on the spy genre\u00a0has been a hit with critics as well, with praise being directed at its lovable cast of characters and impeccable sense of humor. In 2021, the manga was nominated for an Eisner Award, but ultimately lost to Junji Ito's Remina. The anime has also garnered attention for its all-star cast crew. The new show is being produced as a collaboration between two of Japan's top animation studios,\u00a0Wit Studio and CloverWorks. Wit is best known for producing the first three seasons of the Attack on Titan anime, as well as last season's critically acclaimed sleeper hit, Ranking of Kings. CloverWorks is the studio behind the breakout show of the winter season,\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling. The show\u00a0is being directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who previously worked on anime\u00a0such as Le Chevalier D'eon\u00a0and Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. RELATED:\u00a0Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good The show will star Takuya Eguchi as Loid Forger, a.k.a Twilight, a spy who goes undercover as a family man in order to get closer to his next target. Eguchi previously starred in Haikyuu!! and My Love Story. He is joined by Kakegurui star Saori Hayami, who will voice Yor, Loid's new wife who lives a double life of her own as the world's deadliest assassin. Mob Psycho 100's\u00a0Atsumi Tanezaki rounds out the cast as Anya Forger, Loid and Yor's adopted daughter, who is secretly an escaped government experiment with psychic powers. The Spy x Family anime will premiere its simulcast on Crunchyroll on April 9 \u00a0at 11:30 A.M. EST / 8:30 A.M.\u00a0PST. Endo's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

By Michael Lacerna Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A new poll named\u00a0Spy x Family the most anticipated anime of the season. As reported by Crunchyroll, Japan's largest entertainment review site, Filmarks, asked its readers to vote for their most anticipated new series of the spring 2022 season, which includes heavy hitters such as the second season of the popular isekai anime The Rising of the Shield Hero, the third season of the acclaimed romantic-comedy series Kaguya-sama: Love is War and the new psychological thriller Summer Time Rendering, which is being released internationally as the first Disney+ exclusive anime series. These juggernauts were all bested by the\u00a0new anime adaptation of Spy x Family, which earned almost five times as many votes as the second place winner, Kaguya-sama. Shield Hero's second season rounded out the top three.  RELATED:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary The results shouldn't surprise anyone who has paid attention to the rise of Tatsuya Endo's critically lauded\u00a0espionage comedy: since the series' launch in 2019 as an exclusive title for Shueisha's digital\u00a0\u00a0Shonen Jump+ service, the manga\u00a0has achieved a global circulation of over 12 million copies. Endo's light-hearted take on the spy genre\u00a0has been a hit with critics as well, with praise being directed at its lovable cast of characters and impeccable sense of humor. In 2021, the manga was nominated for an Eisner Award, but ultimately lost to Junji Ito's Remina. The anime has also garnered attention for its all-star cast crew. The new show is being produced as a collaboration between two of Japan's top animation studios,\u00a0Wit Studio and CloverWorks. Wit is best known for producing the first three seasons of the Attack on Titan anime, as well as last season's critically acclaimed sleeper hit, Ranking of Kings. CloverWorks is the studio behind the breakout show of the winter season,\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling. The show\u00a0is being directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who previously worked on anime\u00a0such as Le Chevalier D'eon\u00a0and Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. RELATED:\u00a0Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good The show will star Takuya Eguchi as Loid Forger, a.k.a Twilight, a spy who goes undercover as a family man in order to get closer to his next target. Eguchi previously starred in Haikyuu!! and My Love Story. He is joined by Kakegurui star Saori Hayami, who will voice Yor, Loid's new wife who lives a double life of her own as the world's deadliest assassin. Mob Psycho 100's\u00a0Atsumi Tanezaki rounds out the cast as Anya Forger, Loid and Yor's adopted daughter, who is secretly an escaped government experiment with psychic powers. The Spy x Family anime will premiere its simulcast on Crunchyroll on April 9 \u00a0at 11:30 A.M. EST / 8:30 A.M.\u00a0PST. Endo's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

What\u2019s the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Here's a look into the origin and significance of Kyoto Animation's popular mystery anime, Hyouka.      By Ederlyn Peralta Published 22 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The popular\u00a0Kyoto Animation series\u00a0Hyouka\u00a0is based on a 2001 Japanese mystery novel of the same name by Honobu Yonezawa. The story centers on Kamiyama High School\u2019s Classic Literature Club, which was on the verge of being abolished until Hotaro Oreki\u2019s older sister requested that\u00a0she join the club. Oreki and the other members of the club -- Eru Chitanda, Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara -- spend their time solving peculiar mysteries that happen at their school. Hyouka is considered one of the most popular and critically acclaimed anime series produced by Kyoto Animation. Yet, many fans have wondered where the show got its strange name for\u00a0the title. This mystery can be solved by looking into the first major story arc, where\u00a0fans get a detailed explanation\u00a0for\u00a0Hyouka's title.  RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre                  In Episode 3, \u201cThe Circumstances of the Classic Lit Club\u2019s Scion,\u201d Chitanda tells Oreki that she joined the Classic Literature Club because of her uncle, Jun Sekitani. She asks Oreki to help her recall a memory of when she talked about the Classic Literature Club with her uncle. This memory is further triggered when she discovers the club\u2019s cultural festival anthology, Hyouka. In the anthology, the opening remarks talk about Sekitani. Soon after, Oreki, Chitanda and the other members hunt for the truth about what happened to\u00a0him as a student at Kamiyama High School -- and the origin of the club\u2019s anthology name, Hyouka. The answers unfold in Episode 5, \u201cThe Truth About the Historic Classic Lit Club.\u201d The group visits the school's librarian, Y\u014dko K\u014driyama, who happened to be the president of the Classic Literature Club when\u00a0Sekitani\u00a0was involved in the school riots.\u00a0It's explained that the riots occurred because the faculty wanted to shorten the cultural festival from five days to two days. The students went on strike against the school, which eventually led to an accidental fire at its combat sports facility. Sekitani was forced to take the blame for the riots while the true mastermind remained in the shadows.\u00a0Chitanda's uncle ends up being expelled from school,\u00a0but his last request was to have the club\u2019s anthology named Hyouka. RELATED: Science Fell in Love: The Best Lessons of the Science Bear, Rikekuma                  Oreki discovers that the title\u00a0Hyouka\u00a0is an oronym: a sequence of words that sound the same as a different sequence in the English language. In Japanese, \"hyouka\" means \"frozen treat,\" while in English the term translates to ice cream -- and the oronym for \u201cice cream\u201d is \u201cI scream.\u201d At first glance the wordplay seems playful, but it\u2019s referencing something more serious. The title represents Sekitani\u2019s silent frustration and agony for being wrongly expelled.\u00a0His intention was to send a message to future club members that\u00a0they should be strong when confronted with the injustices of the world. After discovering the origin of the anthology\u2019s name, \u201chyouka\u201d becomes a lingering nuance throughout the rest of the series. The Classic Literature Club solves more light-hearted mysteries in contrast to the situation involving Sekitani, but the message of being strong remains relevant as the group must overcome challenges they encounter when solving mysteries.

By Nicky Rodriguez Published 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Sasaki and Miyano is the perfect anime for anyone looking for\u00a0a short but delightfully sweet binge. A refreshingly wholesome BL series, it's a title fit for anyone looking for some light fare, whether they're deep into the BL genre or not. Following the announcement of a new anime series being greenlit, there's no better time than now for fans to dive into Sasaki and Miyano in preparation for more to come. RELATED:\u00a0Sasaki and Miyano's Finale Delivers a Satisfying Romance - and Promises More                  The Plot of\u00a0Sasaki and Miyano Sasaki and Miyano follows\u00a0the titular high schoolers\u00a0as their friendship and burgeoning interest in\u00a0BL manga steadily grow into a romance. Sasaki is a year Miyano's senior and seemingly a typical bad boy.\u00a0He originally found himself smitten with Miyano\u00a0after stepping in to stop a fight to keep Miyano, who he found adorable, from getting hurt. Curiously drawn to him and his passionate enthusiasm for BL manga, Sasaki slowly starts to realize the depth of his feelings for his friend.  Played off throughout the series to various degrees of comical effect, the\u00a0series shows just how much these hidden feelings affect Sasaki as he grapples with understanding what it means to fall in love with a friend of the same gender. What's more, despite being a BL lover, it's a while before Miyano realizes just how much his favorite genre has quickly become his reality. This slice-of-life anime is lighthearted and humorous but filled with plenty of heartfelt moments of support between Sasaki, Miyano and their friends. Whether it be about their interest in BL or each other, the overarching themes and relationships in the series are consistently positive -- a welcome deviation from some of the genre's more\u00a0problematic\u00a0portrayals of romance and affection. RELATED:\u00a0The Best (Healthy) BL Anime on Funimation                  Where to Read the Sasaki and Miyano Manga and Light Novels Sasaki and Miyano\u00a0was created by Shou Harusono in 2016, and the manga was originally serialized online on Pixiv. The manga was later released in tankobon editions by Kadokawa and licensed for Western release by Yen Press, and it's currently still ongoing. Volumes are available for purchase at RightStufAnime for$10.39, Amazon for $11.70 and Barnes and Noble for $13. Digital editions are available at Barnes and Noble and Kindle and Comixology for $6.99. The manga inspired a two-volume novel series by Kotoko Hachijo in 2018 and 2020, although there has yet to be any news on whether these will see an official English release. There is also a spinoff manga series titled Hirano\u00a0and Kagiura, which is currently serialized in the shojo magazine Monthly Comic Gene. The spinoff has so far been collected in two tankobon, but again, there is no news yet on if it will be licensed for Western audiences. RELATED:\u00a0Why Heaven Official's Blessing Is a Show LGBTQ+ Fans Should Be Excited For                  Where to Watch the Sasaki and Miyano Anime The anime debuted in Japan in January 2022, with Funimation simulcasting episodes with each release.

Although only a short watch, Sasaki and Miyano\u00a0quickly amassed a dedicated fanbase thanks to its\u00a0charming story, and it won't easily be forgotten. With the manga ongoing and spinoffs already in existence, it's not unlikely that fans will\u00a0have more merch to add to their collection in time.

By Chris Nishijima Published 12 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    There's no denying that isekai as a genre has only developed as far as it has thanks to its wide success in Japanese pop fiction. After all, the vast majority of works that utilize storylines wherein a protagonist is swept away to a new land come from light novels and anime. Nevertheless, while many critics of the device dismiss it as otaku power fantasies, they often fail to recognize that the idea was inspired by various works of Western literature. Demonstrating the origins of this fantasy subgroup is a collection of\u00a0English isekai stories that have stood the test of time and proven their influence on the modern state of their Japanese successors.  RELATED:\u00a0Wikipedia's April Fools' Gag Involves Isekai Anime\u2019s Most Common Trope Peter Pan - The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up                  With its emphasis on the idyllic and carefree nature of childhood,\u00a0Peter Pan creates an entire world around the idea of playing pretend. J.M. Barrie crafted one of the most iconic isekai of Western literature, filled with mermaids, feral children and pirates, to be visited by Wendy Darling and her brothers John and Michael. Although its plot may serve as a coming-of-age story, driving home the importance of growing up at some point in time, its legacy has solidified it as the image of escapism. In essence, the dreamlike atmosphere of this tale is not unlike the wish-fulfillment distractions that fill modern isekai anime. Just as series like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero and\u00a0That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime base their realities on the hallmarks and mechanics of fantasy roleplay games, the logic and denizens of Neverland are ruled by a kind of childlike whimsy. Both function similarly for their fans, providing a welcome reprieve from the harsh realities of society. The Chronicles of Narnia - The Land of the Great Lion                  Originating with the classic novel\u00a0The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is another beloved isekai series from the British Isles. Following the friends and members of the Pevensie family, each entry transports a group of adolescents to the magical realm of Narnia to thwart some malicious threat. This world is inhabited by numerous fantastical races like centaurs and nymphs, along with humans and talking animals -- the greatest of which is the Great Lion Aslan, true ruler of all. Even though the various child protagonists of the series ended up in Narnia through accidental circumstances, the books imply that Narnia called each of them specifically because they could help in its hour of need. In a way, this could be seen as an early precursor to anime like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero or\u00a0How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom wherein heroes are summoned to save the world from a looming evil. Indeed, with its sprawling geography and interconnected political workings, Narnia has all the key components of a thoroughly developed high fantasy isekai. RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai The Wizard of Oz - Follow the Yellow Brick Road                  One of the first American isekai to enjoy critical acclaim and wide publication, L. Frank Baum's\u00a0The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u00a0is one of history's most important pieces of fiction. Dorothy Gale's journey through Oz spawned a myriad of iconic characters and has inspired countless adaptations and retellings. In addition to acting as a muse for many later works, its movie version marked a massive change in the film and television industry. Although later books in the series would prolong the escapades of Dorothy and her acquaintances, the original novel was largely focused on the idea of her just trying to get back to her own world. This treatment of the fantasy adventure as secondary to the goal of returning home is something that many old school isekai implemented, such as\u00a0Digimon Adventure,\u00a0The Vision of Escaflowne and\u00a0Fushigi Yuugi. Still, just as the\u00a0Oz books eventually had Dorothy permanently relocate to Oz, today's isekai tend to leave their protagonists in another world indefinitely, either through reincarnation or by simply stranding them there with no means of return. Alice in Wonderland - We're All Mad Here                  Perhaps the most famous example of otherworldly travel in fiction is Lewis Carrol's\u00a0Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as its sequel\u00a0Through the Looking Glass. This piece of British literature\u00a0is often considered the first work to\u00a0ever formally use displacement in a parallel world as its central premise. As such, its introduction of the idea makes it the common ancestor of all isekai. Due to its surreal aesthetic, Alice in Wonderland may not have much in common thematically with the more plot-based stories that came after it. However, its influence on countless anime is impossible to ignore. This can be seen in isekai titles such as Magic Knight Rayearth, with its white rabbit-like Mokona, and\u00a0Inuyasha, where its protagonist literally falls down a hole to another reality. Even the gritty death game isekai\u00a0Alice In Borderland borrows from the playing card symbolism, showing just how deep the love for Carrol's masterpiece runs among isekai writers.

By Chris Nishijima Published 12 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    There's no denying that isekai as a genre has only developed as far as it has thanks to its wide success in Japanese pop fiction. After all, the vast majority of works that utilize storylines wherein a protagonist is swept away to a new land come from light novels and anime. Nevertheless, while many critics of the device dismiss it as otaku power fantasies, they often fail to recognize that the idea was inspired by various works of Western literature. Demonstrating the origins of this fantasy subgroup is a collection of\u00a0English isekai stories that have stood the test of time and proven their influence on the modern state of their Japanese successors.  RELATED:\u00a0Wikipedia's April Fools' Gag Involves Isekai Anime\u2019s Most Common Trope Peter Pan - The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up                  With its emphasis on the idyllic and carefree nature of childhood,\u00a0Peter Pan creates an entire world around the idea of playing pretend. J.M. Barrie crafted one of the most iconic isekai of Western literature, filled with mermaids, feral children and pirates, to be visited by Wendy Darling and her brothers John and Michael. Although its plot may serve as a coming-of-age story, driving home the importance of growing up at some point in time, its legacy has solidified it as the image of escapism. In essence, the dreamlike atmosphere of this tale is not unlike the wish-fulfillment distractions that fill modern isekai anime. Just as series like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero and\u00a0That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime base their realities on the hallmarks and mechanics of fantasy roleplay games, the logic and denizens of Neverland are ruled by a kind of childlike whimsy. Both function similarly for their fans, providing a welcome reprieve from the harsh realities of society. The Chronicles of Narnia - The Land of the Great Lion                  Originating with the classic novel\u00a0The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is another beloved isekai series from the British Isles. Following the friends and members of the Pevensie family, each entry transports a group of adolescents to the magical realm of Narnia to thwart some malicious threat. This world is inhabited by numerous fantastical races like centaurs and nymphs, along with humans and talking animals -- the greatest of which is the Great Lion Aslan, true ruler of all. Even though the various child protagonists of the series ended up in Narnia through accidental circumstances, the books imply that Narnia called each of them specifically because they could help in its hour of need. In a way, this could be seen as an early precursor to anime like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero or\u00a0How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom wherein heroes are summoned to save the world from a looming evil. Indeed, with its sprawling geography and interconnected political workings, Narnia has all the key components of a thoroughly developed high fantasy isekai. RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai The Wizard of Oz - Follow the Yellow Brick Road                  One of the first American isekai to enjoy critical acclaim and wide publication, L. Frank Baum's\u00a0The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u00a0is one of history's most important pieces of fiction. Dorothy Gale's journey through Oz spawned a myriad of iconic characters and has inspired countless adaptations and retellings. In addition to acting as a muse for many later works, its movie version marked a massive change in the film and television industry. Although later books in the series would prolong the escapades of Dorothy and her acquaintances, the original novel was largely focused on the idea of her just trying to get back to her own world. This treatment of the fantasy adventure as secondary to the goal of returning home is something that many old school isekai implemented, such as\u00a0Digimon Adventure,\u00a0The Vision of Escaflowne and\u00a0Fushigi Yuugi. Still, just as the\u00a0Oz books eventually had Dorothy permanently relocate to Oz, today's isekai tend to leave their protagonists in another world indefinitely, either through reincarnation or by simply stranding them there with no means of return. Alice in Wonderland - We're All Mad Here                  Perhaps the most famous example of otherworldly travel in fiction is Lewis Carrol's\u00a0Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as its sequel\u00a0Through the Looking Glass. This piece of British literature\u00a0is often considered the first work to\u00a0ever formally use displacement in a parallel world as its central premise. As such, its introduction of the idea makes it the common ancestor of all isekai. Due to its surreal aesthetic, Alice in Wonderland may not have much in common thematically with the more plot-based stories that came after it. However, its influence on countless anime is impossible to ignore. This can be seen in isekai titles such as Magic Knight Rayearth, with its white rabbit-like Mokona, and\u00a0Inuyasha, where its protagonist literally falls down a hole to another reality. Even the gritty death game isekai\u00a0Alice In Borderland borrows from the playing card symbolism, showing just how deep the love for Carrol's masterpiece runs among isekai writers.

Black Clover: Will Asta Finally Learn Who His Mom Is? Chapter 328 of Black Clover seems to suggest that Asta will finally get to know his mother.      By Marc York Published 16 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Black Clover Chapter 328, by Y\u016bki Tabata, available in English from Viz Media. For most of Black Clover, Asta's mother Licita has remained a mystery to the boy, because she left him at the Hage Village\u00a0church when he was a baby. He grew up healthy, but it nevertheless would have been nice if he'd gotten to know his mom, at least a little. However, that gap in Asta's knowledge might be filled in the near future. Chapter 328 of the manga, \"Always,\" puts a\u00a0good amount of focus on Licita. For how much she's emphasized, it wouldn't be surprising if Asta\u00a0finally found out about her. Here's a look at what happened, how it could lead to Asta learning the truth, and what it could mean for the future of\u00a0Black Clover.  RELATED:\u00a0Black Clover Movie Teaser Trailer Reveals 2023 Premiere Window                  In actuality, the primary focus of this chapter was the finale of the long\u00a0battle between Asta and Liebe and Lucifero. With only seconds of their Devil Union left, Asta and Liebe had to finish off this ruler of the underworld quickly. In classic shonen fashion, such an\u00a0epic climax caused the characters to think about everything that led to it. In this case, Liebe apparently flashed back to his time with Licita. As the two watch the sunset over Hage's demon skeleton, Licita tells the young demon about how she had to leave her son\u00a0lest her ability drains him of his life. She insists that despite failing Asta as a mom, she will always love him. It's possible that Asta can see Liebe's memories of Licita since they're sharing a body through Devil Union. If this is the case, then he might be able to tell who she is either from the context clues or the uncanny resemblance to himself. Even if Asta can't see these memories, Liebe will have to share what he knows eventually. Lucifero was also able to pick up on the connection through different means. In his case, he recognized the look in Asta's eyes; to him, it was like that of Licita, whom he is responsible for killing. He almost commented on this out loud, saying \"that blasted, worthless woman. The one who got in my way. She's your-!!!\" However, Asta cut him off with the business end of his Demon-Slasher Katana. RELATED: Black Clover, Kageki Shojo Headline Funimation's Home Video Lineup It's likely that Asta and Liebe heard what Lucifero was trying to say. They responded to his line by saying \"you're the one who's worthless,\" which means they were definitely listening to him. While the word \"mother\" never left the demon lord's mouth, either Asta or Liebe could easily fill in the blank.                  While learning about his mother won't necessarily affect him, Asta should at least have his curiosity piqued by the opportunity. Assuming Asta does, in fact, find out about Licita, it could change a lot about his dynamic with Liebe.\u00a0 It could further strengthen the bond between the two boys; they're already good friends, but\u00a0realizing that they shared a mother could cause them to grow as close as siblings, closer than even Asta and Yuno. It might even lead the two of them to find a more refined form of Devil Union; if Black Clover\u00a0really does continue after this arc, they'll probably need it. In any case, Asta figuring out the truth can only benefit the story. Whether Asta found out about his mother or not in this chapter, the door has been left open. Should he end up walking through it, it gives both him and Liebe a good chance to develop as both characters and as siblings. As long as the two of them remain connected, the topic will have to come up sooner or later. Everyone deserves to know about their mother, especially anime protagonists; it worked out for Naruto, so it should definitely do wonders for Asta.

They responded to his line by saying \"you're the one who's worthless,\" which means they were definitely listening to him. While the word \"mother\" never left the demon lord's mouth, either Asta or Liebe could easily fill in the blank.                  While learning about his mother won't necessarily affect him, Asta should at least have his curiosity piqued by the opportunity. Assuming Asta does, in fact, find out about Licita, it could change a lot about his dynamic with Liebe.\u00a0 It could further strengthen the bond between the two boys; they're already good friends, but\u00a0realizing that they shared a mother could cause them to grow as close as siblings, closer than even Asta and Yuno. It might even lead the two of them to find a more refined form of Devil Union; if Black Clover\u00a0really does continue after this arc, they'll probably need it. In any case, Asta figuring out the truth can only benefit the story. Whether Asta found out about his mother or not in this chapter, the door has been left open. Should he end up walking through it, it gives both him and Liebe a good chance to develop as both characters and as siblings. As long as the two of them remain connected, the topic will have to come up sooner or later. Everyone deserves to know about their mother, especially anime protagonists; it worked out for Naruto, so it should definitely do wonders for Asta.

By Louis Kemner Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a returning rom-com anime\u00a0of the spring 2022 anime season. Its story\u00a0takes place in Saitama University, where a small handful of grad student scientists are determined to use every experiment and formula in the book to determine if they are truly in love. Only the most rigorous testing will reveal the romantic answers in this charming series. It's been a few years since\u00a0Season 1 of Science Fell in Love\u00a0so as the much-anticipated Season 2 begins, new and returning fans alike will want to know the main cast\u00a0and see what makes them tick as both scientists and people. Some of them embody classic anime archetypes and tropes,\u00a0while others are truly one of a kind.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya Yukimura Shinya, The Cool-Headed Love Interest                  Yukimura Shinya is one of the two main lovers in\u00a0Science Fell in Love, though he doesn't always act like the lovestruck young man he is. In fact, Shinya is a recent example of the kuudere character archetype, a confident character who hides their warm, fuzzy emotions behind a cool and aloof exterior. One day, Shinya received an unexpected love confession from his lab partner Himuro Ayame. While he doesn't like to show it,\u00a0he is secretly hoping with all his might that\u00a0their budding romance is genuine -- and will do anything to prove it. Shinya is also the one who, in his boyhood, inspired Ayame to embrace her love of science rather than feel ashamed of it, which may be what drew\u00a0her to him in the first place. Between the two, Shinya is far less likely to make emotional outbursts or act on a whim, but he might secretly admire Ayame for doing so. That's the kuudere way. RELATED: The Best Light Novel Series With Ridiculously Long Titles Himuro Ayame, The Lovestruck Lab Partner                  The lovely Himuro Ayame is Shinya's lab partner and #1 admirer ever since she received kind words of encouragement from him in her girlhood. For years Ayame has loved science and the answers it can provide for life's everyday questions. Now she's ready to use every formula, instrument and experiment she can think of to determine whether her overflowing affection for Shinya is genuine -- or just superficial attraction. Ayame is more of a poetic romantic than Shinya, being a believer in romantic gestures and more likely to listen to her heart, but she also can't forget her duty as a scientist. Ayame is equally likely to consult a data chart or run experiments on her own heart rate as she is to consult a friend about her feelings, making her better balanced but also slightly more vulnerable than Shinya. She is known for having a real temper when she thinks her love is being threatened. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance - But It Isn't Necessary Ibarada Ena Likes To Tease Her Lab Partners                  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have a few friends who tag along for the ride and comment on their endless love experiments, including\u00a0the tiny but surprisingly tough Ibarada Ena, who loves sweet snacks, all kinds of video games and frilly clothes under her white lab coat. So far, it doesn't seem Ena has a crush of her own in Science Fell in Love\u00a0but she does support Shinya and Ayame's budding romance in her own way, sometimes providing input or corrections for Shinya and Ayame's experiments. Ena is also a childhood friend of Inukai Kosuke -- and has him wrapped around her little finger, so to speak. RELATED: The Real-Life Science Behind Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove it Inukai Kosuke Loves 2-D Girls                  Inukai Kosuke is\u00a0Science Fell in Love's comic relief, a somewhat sloppy but well-meaning scientist who is more passionate about dating sim games and waifu pillows than finding work as a scientist after he graduates from Saitama University. He's usually the butt of the jokes, though he is also a trustworthy ally of Shinya's and a good friend to Ena, even if they make fun of him sometimes.\u00a0Kosuke also delivered a quirky but well thought-out presentation on video game theory at a conference in Okinawa late in Season 1. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Kanade Kotonoha Believes In True Love, Too                  One of Ayame's best friends in the lab is the easygoing Kanade Kotonoha, who has been a believer in true love ever since her high school days\u00a0when she nursed a serious crush on a handsome male teacher who helped encourage her curiosity about the world. She plays a minor supporting role in Science Fell in Love as a trustworthy ally to Ayame. While Kanade is easily annoyed or flabbergasted by the romantic love antics around her, she dearly wants her friends to find true happiness and let love blossom between them. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Anime Releases of the Spring 2022 Season Rikekuma Is The Science Bear                  A bonus character is the science bear Rikekuma, a stuffed animal that can think and speak like a person.

By Louis Kemner Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a returning rom-com anime\u00a0of the spring 2022 anime season. Its story\u00a0takes place in Saitama University, where a small handful of grad student scientists are determined to use every experiment and formula in the book to determine if they are truly in love. Only the most rigorous testing will reveal the romantic answers in this charming series. It's been a few years since\u00a0Season 1 of Science Fell in Love\u00a0so as the much-anticipated Season 2 begins, new and returning fans alike will want to know the main cast\u00a0and see what makes them tick as both scientists and people. Some of them embody classic anime archetypes and tropes,\u00a0while others are truly one of a kind.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya Yukimura Shinya, The Cool-Headed Love Interest                  Yukimura Shinya is one of the two main lovers in\u00a0Science Fell in Love, though he doesn't always act like the lovestruck young man he is. In fact, Shinya is a recent example of the kuudere character archetype, a confident character who hides their warm, fuzzy emotions behind a cool and aloof exterior. One day, Shinya received an unexpected love confession from his lab partner Himuro Ayame. While he doesn't like to show it,\u00a0he is secretly hoping with all his might that\u00a0their budding romance is genuine -- and will do anything to prove it. Shinya is also the one who, in his boyhood, inspired Ayame to embrace her love of science rather than feel ashamed of it, which may be what drew\u00a0her to him in the first place. Between the two, Shinya is far less likely to make emotional outbursts or act on a whim, but he might secretly admire Ayame for doing so. That's the kuudere way. RELATED: The Best Light Novel Series With Ridiculously Long Titles Himuro Ayame, The Lovestruck Lab Partner                  The lovely Himuro Ayame is Shinya's lab partner and #1 admirer ever since she received kind words of encouragement from him in her girlhood. For years Ayame has loved science and the answers it can provide for life's everyday questions. Now she's ready to use every formula, instrument and experiment she can think of to determine whether her overflowing affection for Shinya is genuine -- or just superficial attraction. Ayame is more of a poetic romantic than Shinya, being a believer in romantic gestures and more likely to listen to her heart, but she also can't forget her duty as a scientist. Ayame is equally likely to consult a data chart or run experiments on her own heart rate as she is to consult a friend about her feelings, making her better balanced but also slightly more vulnerable than Shinya. She is known for having a real temper when she thinks her love is being threatened. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance - But It Isn't Necessary Ibarada Ena Likes To Tease Her Lab Partners                  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have a few friends who tag along for the ride and comment on their endless love experiments, including\u00a0the tiny but surprisingly tough Ibarada Ena, who loves sweet snacks, all kinds of video games and frilly clothes under her white lab coat. So far, it doesn't seem Ena has a crush of her own in Science Fell in Love\u00a0but she does support Shinya and Ayame's budding romance in her own way, sometimes providing input or corrections for Shinya and Ayame's experiments. Ena is also a childhood friend of Inukai Kosuke -- and has him wrapped around her little finger, so to speak. RELATED: The Real-Life Science Behind Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove it Inukai Kosuke Loves 2-D Girls                  Inukai Kosuke is\u00a0Science Fell in Love's comic relief, a somewhat sloppy but well-meaning scientist who is more passionate about dating sim games and waifu pillows than finding work as a scientist after he graduates from Saitama University. He's usually the butt of the jokes, though he is also a trustworthy ally of Shinya's and a good friend to Ena, even if they make fun of him sometimes.\u00a0Kosuke also delivered a quirky but well thought-out presentation on video game theory at a conference in Okinawa late in Season 1. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Kanade Kotonoha Believes In True Love, Too                  One of Ayame's best friends in the lab is the easygoing Kanade Kotonoha, who has been a believer in true love ever since her high school days\u00a0when she nursed a serious crush on a handsome male teacher who helped encourage her curiosity about the world. She plays a minor supporting role in Science Fell in Love as a trustworthy ally to Ayame. While Kanade is easily annoyed or flabbergasted by the romantic love antics around her, she dearly wants her friends to find true happiness and let love blossom between them. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Anime Releases of the Spring 2022 Season Rikekuma Is The Science Bear                  A bonus character is the science bear Rikekuma, a stuffed animal that can think and speak like a person. In between scenes, the sharp-tongued Rikekuma will deliver short lectures and expand on the ideas, theories and references mentioned in the episode. No one can scientifically verify how a teddy bear can do all this, but that's just part of the fun. Even Science Fell in Love can bend the truth a little.

Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media        Pok\u00e9mon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media A new documentary explores the story behind the 20-year old Pok\u00e9mon musical, a now mostly forgotten facet of the popular franchise's history.     By Michael Lacerna Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A new documentary shines new light on\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live, a mostly forgotten musical from the video game and anime franchise's initial boom period. The 68-minute long documentary, entitled Pok\u00e9mon Live: How Pikachu Nearly Took Broadway, was created by\u00a0Jonii Vee and Jamie D. Elms of the retro-gaming focused YouTube channel, Stuff We Play. While live show adaptations of popular kids' cartoons are often seen as shameless cash-ins, the new documentary explores the surprising amount of thought and effort\u00a0that went into\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live and why the play was never released on home video. The play is also notable for being one of the first professional acting jobs for Andrew Rannells, who played Team Rocket's James in the play and would later go on to star in The Book of Mormon and Girls.  RELATED:\u00a0Logan Paul Wore a $5 Million Pok\u00e9mon Card to the Ring for WrestleMania Match     The documentary includes interviews with playwright Michael Slade, actor Jesse Nager, who played the role of an original character named Joe the Deaf Trainer, and actor Patrick Frankfort, who portrayed Professor Oak. The doc\u00a0also features\u00a0rare archival footage of the musical itself, which was never officially released on VHS or DVD. The film reveals several notable bits of trivia\u00a0from the play's production, including a story about how the play's script had to be approved by Ikue Otani, the voice of Pikachu, and how the play's producers tried to create an all-new, original\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon\u00a0for the stage show. The play itself told a story focused around Ash, Misty and Brock, as they try to stop a new plot from Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni, who has created Mecha Mewtwo, a new version of the original games' most powerful legendary. Mecha Mewtwo is capable of copying any other\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's moves, but still needs to learn how to copy Pikachu's particularly powerful electric attacks before it can be completed. Notably, the play features songs\u00a0about Misty coming to terms with her romantic feelings for Ash, and a song performed by an anthropomorphized representation of the series' electronic\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon encyclopedia, the\u00a0Pok\u00e9dex.

Nintendo and Game Freak previously spent the majority of 2021 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the video game franchise, and recently offered a peak\u00a0into the series' future with the first look at\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, a new set of games which will be released for the Nintendo Switch before the end of 2022.

Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media A new documentary explores the story behind the 20-year old Pok\u00e9mon musical, a now mostly forgotten facet of the popular franchise's history.     By Michael Lacerna Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A new documentary shines new light on\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live, a mostly forgotten musical from the video game and anime franchise's initial boom period. The 68-minute long documentary, entitled Pok\u00e9mon Live: How Pikachu Nearly Took Broadway, was created by\u00a0Jonii Vee and Jamie D. Elms of the retro-gaming focused YouTube channel, Stuff We Play. While live show adaptations of popular kids' cartoons are often seen as shameless cash-ins, the new documentary explores the surprising amount of thought and effort\u00a0that went into\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live and why the play was never released on home video. The play is also notable for being one of the first professional acting jobs for Andrew Rannells, who played Team Rocket's James in the play and would later go on to star in The Book of Mormon and Girls.  RELATED:\u00a0Logan Paul Wore a $5 Million Pok\u00e9mon Card to the Ring for WrestleMania Match     The documentary includes interviews with playwright Michael Slade, actor Jesse Nager, who played the role of an original character named Joe the Deaf Trainer, and actor Patrick Frankfort, who portrayed Professor Oak. The doc\u00a0also features\u00a0rare archival footage of the musical itself, which was never officially released on VHS or DVD. The film reveals several notable bits of trivia\u00a0from the play's production, including a story about how the play's script had to be approved by Ikue Otani, the voice of Pikachu, and how the play's producers tried to create an all-new, original\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon\u00a0for the stage show. The play itself told a story focused around Ash, Misty and Brock, as they try to stop a new plot from Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni, who has created Mecha Mewtwo, a new version of the original games' most powerful legendary. Mecha Mewtwo is capable of copying any other\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's moves, but still needs to learn how to copy Pikachu's particularly powerful electric attacks before it can be completed. Notably, the play features songs\u00a0about Misty coming to terms with her romantic feelings for Ash, and a song performed by an anthropomorphized representation of the series' electronic\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon encyclopedia, the\u00a0Pok\u00e9dex.

Nintendo and Game Freak previously spent the majority of 2021 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the video game franchise, and recently offered a peak\u00a0into the series' future with the first look at\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, a new set of games which will be released for the Nintendo Switch before the end of 2022.

Doron Dororon's beloved duo Dora and Kusanagi have\u00a0constantly\u00a0done their best to purge all the evil Mononoke\u00a0monsters. Since Kusanagi isn't necessarily an ally most humans will readily accept, they initially worked under the radar. However, their vigilante works were quickly put to a halt when they faced the accursed Hanya Gyuuki, and the esteemed Samurai learned of their existence and ability. After successfully appealing to the higher-ups, Dora and Kusanagi gained the right to operate as Samurai under Heisuke Ujii's guidance as he trained the\u00a0pair alongside his other subordinates. He was also partly responsible for Kusanagi's epiphany of enshrouding Dora with its supernatural energy. During their fight against the humanoid Mononoke, the duo unleashes the technique they've honed with Touma Toda. It's extremely powerful, but there's a\u00a0drawback as well.  RELATED:\u00a0Ranking of Kings' Biggest Questions After the Season 1 Finale                  After saving Ichiha from Tameemon's hands, Yoshihime lured Ujii deeper into the Mononoke's trap\u00a0while\u00a0Dora, Kusanagi and Touma were left to deal with the drunkard Mononoke. The fight immediately became one-sided with Touma repeatedly receiving Tameemon's attacks. The humanoid Mononoke was quick on the uptake, noticing that the Samurai was holding back against him. He revealed that the previous Samurai he'd faced were quick to launch an attack on him -- a revelation that initially angered Touma, but he managed to remain calm. Just then, a sudden burst of supernatural energy erupted from Dora and Kusanagi. When Tameemon sensed the duo's power, he\u00a0aimed to\u00a0eliminate them quickly, drinking his booze and\u00a0undergoing a power-up. Seeing the Mononoke charging toward the duo, Touma put\u00a0himself between them and acted as a shield. He\u00a0successfully\u00a0dodged the first attack, but the air pressure still sent the Samurai flying. Even so, Touma regained his footing\u00a0but received another killer technique from Tameemon, which finally took him down. However,\u00a0the sacrifice\u00a0wasn't in vain; Dora and Kusanagi ultimately finished their preparation and cut the humanoid Mononoke with their first killing technique: Merged Humanoke Heaven-and-Earth Slash. RELATED:\u00a0Doron Dororon Has Its Own Satoru Gojo - With a Funny Twist                  The human-Mononoke pair's strongest attack yet in Doron Dororon is a result of them merging together. Kusanagi envelops Dora with its supernatural energy, which then allowed Dora to focus and utilize\u00a0that energy. The drawback, however, is that the merging happens in stages rather than a continuous manner. The duo must maintain their focus throughout the process, which leaves them vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately Touma volunteers to be their tank, which is exactly what he did during their fight against Tameemon. Dora and Kusanagi may have ultimately found a way around Dora's lack of supernatural ability, but their strongest attack is still far from being efficient. Although Touma is a very efficient tank, he won't be able to hold his ground against multiple enemies -- at least not with his current abilities. That being said,\u00a0the duo will\u00a0definitely\u00a0have to\u00a0find a way to hasten their merging if they want to be of more use in future battles in\u00a0Doron Dororon.

By Ryan McCarthy Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Goh has been quite the polarizing character since his introduction in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys. In pursuit of his dream to catch the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Mew, Goh has decided he would also like to catch one of every Pok\u00e9mon. To his credit, Goh works hard toward his dream by catching Pok\u00e9mon at an impressively high rate. Some fans are rubbed the wrong way by how easily\u00a0he catches most of his Pok\u00e9mon -- only for them to be immediately transported to Cerise Labs -- but there's one critical difference between Goh's Pok\u00e9mon storage and Ash's that makes\u00a0one the superior trainer: Goh actually takes care of all\u00a0his Pok\u00e9mon.  RELATED:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's Biggest Unresolved Cliffhanger Was Caused By a Real-World Disaster                  At the time of writing, Goh has over 100 Pok\u00e9mon residing at Professor Cerise's lab. The series' original catchphrase was \"Gotta Catch 'Em All,\" and Goh has embodied that mission statement more than Ash ever has. Unlike the games, Goh's excess Pok\u00e9mon are not converted to data and stored on a computer. Pok\u00e9mon in the anime are living creatures that need daily care, which would make it cruel for Goh to catch as many as he does just for the sake of his collection. However, the anime has demonstrated on many occasions that when Goh is not on an errand or adventure with Ash, he spends his days caring for each and every one of his Pok\u00e9mon,\u00a0which Ash has never done. Whenever Ash ends\u00a0his journey around a region and decides to start over, he dumps his newly caught Pok\u00e9mon at Professor Oak's lab -- Kukui's for his Alolan Pok\u00e9mon -- and never looks back. In Ash's defense, he can\u2019t exactly care for his many Pok\u00e9mon while on an adventure, but even when he's in Pallet Town he still doesn't help care for them. Ash has over 60 of his own Pok\u00e9mon at Oak's lab, yet even when he drops by to say hello, he still doesn't lend a hand to their daily care and give Oak and Tracy Sketchit a break. Ash's Pok\u00e9mon go months at a time without ever seeing their trainer, while Goh's Pok\u00e9mon see him nearly every day. Multiple episodes of the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys anime are centered around a day of Goh caring for his Pok\u00e9mon at Cerise Labs. He brings in pallet after pallet of food, brings the\u00a0meal each of his Pok\u00e9mon likes to wherever they prefer to hang out, and checks in on their well-being. He noticed when one of his Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 was missing a pedal from its flower, and spent time exercising with his gigantic Magikarp to help the bulky Pok\u00e9mon stay in shape. Meanwhile, Ash's Infernape ran away from Oak's lab to look for new Fire-type opponents, something Ash could have prevented if he bothered to check in and see how his Pok\u00e9mon are actually doing more often. RELATED:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's New Intro Teases the Return of Two Major Characters                  While it's undebatable that Ash is the more skilled trainer when it comes to battling, Goh is a better trainer in that he actually cares for all of his Pok\u00e9mon. Responsibility has never been Ash's forte, but Goh is flat out making him look negligent when it comes to actually raising Pok\u00e9mon. Ash's tunnel vision toward his goal even briefly drove Pikachu to run away from him when Ash couldn't be bothered to do anything but train his Riolu.\u00a0He tends to keep the same five Pok\u00e9mon and Pikachu with him for extended periods, while Goh regularly swaps out his Pok\u00e9mon and brings random assortments of them along on an adventure. As the\u00a0World Coronation Series approaches its end in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys, it's hard to imagine where Ash Ketchum's character could go from here, whether he wins or not. The Journeys anime has felt like a farewell tour of sorts with countless cameos from legacy characters -- and\u00a0there are several more cameos on the way. If Goh truly is being groomed to take over for Ash as Pok\u00e9mon's lead protagonist, he's already made a good impression by always being a responsible and caring Pok\u00e9mon trainer, whereas Ash is often caring but usually irresponsible.

By Ryan McCarthy Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Goh has been quite the polarizing character since his introduction in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys. In pursuit of his dream to catch the Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, Mew, Goh has decided he would also like to catch one of every Pok\u00e9mon. To his credit, Goh works hard toward his dream by catching Pok\u00e9mon at an impressively high rate. Some fans are rubbed the wrong way by how easily\u00a0he catches most of his Pok\u00e9mon -- only for them to be immediately transported to Cerise Labs -- but there's one critical difference between Goh's Pok\u00e9mon storage and Ash's that makes\u00a0one the superior trainer: Goh actually takes care of all\u00a0his Pok\u00e9mon.  RELATED:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's Biggest Unresolved Cliffhanger Was Caused By a Real-World Disaster                  At the time of writing, Goh has over 100 Pok\u00e9mon residing at Professor Cerise's lab. The series' original catchphrase was \"Gotta Catch 'Em All,\" and Goh has embodied that mission statement more than Ash ever has. Unlike the games, Goh's excess Pok\u00e9mon are not converted to data and stored on a computer. Pok\u00e9mon in the anime are living creatures that need daily care, which would make it cruel for Goh to catch as many as he does just for the sake of his collection. However, the anime has demonstrated on many occasions that when Goh is not on an errand or adventure with Ash, he spends his days caring for each and every one of his Pok\u00e9mon,\u00a0which Ash has never done. Whenever Ash ends\u00a0his journey around a region and decides to start over, he dumps his newly caught Pok\u00e9mon at Professor Oak's lab -- Kukui's for his Alolan Pok\u00e9mon -- and never looks back. In Ash's defense, he can\u2019t exactly care for his many Pok\u00e9mon while on an adventure, but even when he's in Pallet Town he still doesn't help care for them. Ash has over 60 of his own Pok\u00e9mon at Oak's lab, yet even when he drops by to say hello, he still doesn't lend a hand to their daily care and give Oak and Tracy Sketchit a break. Ash's Pok\u00e9mon go months at a time without ever seeing their trainer, while Goh's Pok\u00e9mon see him nearly every day. Multiple episodes of the Pok\u00e9mon Journeys anime are centered around a day of Goh caring for his Pok\u00e9mon at Cerise Labs. He brings in pallet after pallet of food, brings the\u00a0meal each of his Pok\u00e9mon likes to wherever they prefer to hang out, and checks in on their well-being. He noticed when one of his Flab\u00e9b\u00e9 was missing a pedal from its flower, and spent time exercising with his gigantic Magikarp to help the bulky Pok\u00e9mon stay in shape. Meanwhile, Ash's Infernape ran away from Oak's lab to look for new Fire-type opponents, something Ash could have prevented if he bothered to check in and see how his Pok\u00e9mon are actually doing more often. RELATED:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's New Intro Teases the Return of Two Major Characters                  While it's undebatable that Ash is the more skilled trainer when it comes to battling, Goh is a better trainer in that he actually cares for all of his Pok\u00e9mon. Responsibility has never been Ash's forte, but Goh is flat out making him look negligent when it comes to actually raising Pok\u00e9mon. Ash's tunnel vision toward his goal even briefly drove Pikachu to run away from him when Ash couldn't be bothered to do anything but train his Riolu.\u00a0He tends to keep the same five Pok\u00e9mon and Pikachu with him for extended periods, while Goh regularly swaps out his Pok\u00e9mon and brings random assortments of them along on an adventure. As the\u00a0World Coronation Series approaches its end in Pok\u00e9mon Journeys, it's hard to imagine where Ash Ketchum's character could go from here, whether he wins or not. The Journeys anime has felt like a farewell tour of sorts with countless cameos from legacy characters -- and\u00a0there are several more cameos on the way. If Goh truly is being groomed to take over for Ash as Pok\u00e9mon's lead protagonist, he's already made a good impression by always being a responsible and caring Pok\u00e9mon trainer, whereas Ash is often caring but usually irresponsible.
