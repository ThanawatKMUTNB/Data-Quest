Written by Dennis Hopeless, with visuals from artist Eduardo Pansica, J\u00falio Ferreira, and Dexter Soy, colors by Jeremiah Skipper and Peter Pantazis, and letters by Wes Abbot, Suicide Squad #14 brings to an end a promising arc of a usually thrilling series, but with a few twists. This issue, entitled \"Defunded - Part 1,\" picks up where the last issue left off after Amanda Waller's victory over the Evil Justice League of Earth-3 with the reluctant assistance of the Suicide Squad.  Victory is short-lived, however. Back in their own dimension, the Squad is in shambles. Two members died in battle, with Talon dying soon after, Culebra is left without a body, Belle Reve has been destroyed, Amanda Waller is M.I.A., and the Task Force X is disbanded. The Squad finds themselves without purpose or funding, though at least they got to keep Bloodsport and his brothers. What's a ragtag team of misfit heroes to do now? Their first mission is to reconvene, then they must find new funding, at any cost. Rick Flag has a few ideas on how to get it. Related: The X-Men's Oldest Rivals Created a Marvel Suicide Squad Years Before the Thunderbolts                 Suicide Squad is a franchise known for its reckless abandon, chaos, dark humor, and disregard for convention, matching the wild-card attitudes of its ragtag cast of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and misfits. Everything from victories and losses to brutal deaths and mutilations has a wicked sense of comedy to them. Most of the time, it's effective. However, Suicide Squad #14 doesn't quite match this energy. In this series, the last 13 issues have focused on the crossover event, the War for Earth-3. It was a high-stakes battle with plenty of bloodshed, casualties, and drama that ended abruptly. This is a recurring problem for Suicide Squad #14. Plots that were previously built up, character arcs that were being developed, and new twists for the story are all dropped abruptly and with little to no warning or resolution. Belle Reve's destruction is sudden and feels almost aimless, doing nothing more than scattering the Squad a little further -- a problem that is resolved pretty quickly. Talon's death is a mere hand wave and lacks the impact it could have had, despite his final tender moment with Culebra, which Ambug Bug so kindly elaborates on for the audience's benefit.  This sort of irreverence is par for the course for the Suicide Squad, which has reveled in its subversive take on superheroes and the conventions of the DC Comics canon. However, it fails here because the issue loses much of its narrative momentum immediately afterward, save for a few scenes that, while action-filled and fun, feel disjointed. Related: Suicide Squad's Bloodsport is Trying to Solve a Multiversal Mystery                Up to this point, writer Dennis Hopeless has captured the tone and pacing of the Suicide Squad nicely; however, this issue is lacking in comparison because the previous arc dropped right as it was picking up steam. Suicide Squad #14 feels less like another chapter in a story and more like a filler issue between two arcs. The issue focuses on picking up the pieces of the Earth-3 storyline and scrambling to tie loose ends, which can be frustrating to read.  However, Suicide Squad #14 isn't without a few draws. There are glimmers of that signature twisted humor that makes the series so enjoyable. Ambush Bug is the standout of the cast for his carefree, naive attitude, quick wit, and distinctive speech patterns. His chemistry with Peacemaker, in all his surly and violent glory, steals the show. The visuals shine here as well, with the line art having a rough, almost unfinished quality with pulpy, grimy textures in the colors. Suicide Squad #14 doesn't feel like a conclusion to an arc but rather a bridge between two stories -- one that can be difficult for some readers to cross without some sense of disappointment. However, the ending scene and a promising tease of Lex Luthor's involvement in the story give readers plenty of incentive to make their way to the other side.

Related: The X-Men's Oldest Rivals Created a Marvel Suicide Squad Years Before the Thunderbolts                 Suicide Squad is a franchise known for its reckless abandon, chaos, dark humor, and disregard for convention, matching the wild-card attitudes of its ragtag cast of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and misfits. Everything from victories and losses to brutal deaths and mutilations has a wicked sense of comedy to them. Most of the time, it's effective. However, Suicide Squad #14 doesn't quite match this energy. In this series, the last 13 issues have focused on the crossover event, the War for Earth-3. It was a high-stakes battle with plenty of bloodshed, casualties, and drama that ended abruptly. This is a recurring problem for Suicide Squad #14. Plots that were previously built up, character arcs that were being developed, and new twists for the story are all dropped abruptly and with little to no warning or resolution. Belle Reve's destruction is sudden and feels almost aimless, doing nothing more than scattering the Squad a little further -- a problem that is resolved pretty quickly. Talon's death is a mere hand wave and lacks the impact it could have had, despite his final tender moment with Culebra, which Ambug Bug so kindly elaborates on for the audience's benefit.  This sort of irreverence is par for the course for the Suicide Squad, which has reveled in its subversive take on superheroes and the conventions of the DC Comics canon. However, it fails here because the issue loses much of its narrative momentum immediately afterward, save for a few scenes that, while action-filled and fun, feel disjointed. Related: Suicide Squad's Bloodsport is Trying to Solve a Multiversal Mystery                Up to this point, writer Dennis Hopeless has captured the tone and pacing of the Suicide Squad nicely; however, this issue is lacking in comparison because the previous arc dropped right as it was picking up steam. Suicide Squad #14 feels less like another chapter in a story and more like a filler issue between two arcs. The issue focuses on picking up the pieces of the Earth-3 storyline and scrambling to tie loose ends, which can be frustrating to read.  However, Suicide Squad #14 isn't without a few draws. There are glimmers of that signature twisted humor that makes the series so enjoyable. Ambush Bug is the standout of the cast for his carefree, naive attitude, quick wit, and distinctive speech patterns. His chemistry with Peacemaker, in all his surly and violent glory, steals the show. The visuals shine here as well, with the line art having a rough, almost unfinished quality with pulpy, grimy textures in the colors. Suicide Squad #14 doesn't feel like a conclusion to an arc but rather a bridge between two stories -- one that can be difficult for some readers to cross without some sense of disappointment. However, the ending scene and a promising tease of Lex Luthor's involvement in the story give readers plenty of incentive to make their way to the other side.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 2 of Aharen-San is Indecipherable, \"Are We Being Followed?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Aharen-San is Indecipherable is a charming new rom-com anime series starring the petite Aharen Raina and her new friend, the kind boy Raido. It follows them and their adventures together in their quintessential high school life. So far, Raido has had a tough time knowing what exactly Aharen is saying, but often, Aharen's actions speak louder than words.  Aharen, as a shy kuudere character, can't easily express herself to others, even her friends, but when she sees a friend in need, she will never hesitate to act. That's exactly what she does in Episode 2 when she lets her altruistic actions do the talking to brighten everyone else's day. She's an even kinder girl than Episode 1 suggested. RELATED: Science Fell in Love: Why Did Ayame Originally Fall For Shinya?                In a gentle, slice-of-life style anime like Aharen-San is Indecipherable, even the smallest gestures of kindness can go a long way and make all the difference in someone's day. This is what happens when Raido and Aharen realize that they need each other more than ever. It all starts when Aharen arrives at homeroom with one eye squeezed shut since she got a bit of debris in that eye, and she couldn't easily give herself eyedrops to fix the problem. So, Raido helps administer the eyedrops, and later, when Raido also gets something in his eye, Aharen actually lays Raido's head on her lap and gives him eyedrops in return. These little gestures speak loudly in a series like Aharen-San, and the eyedrop exchange sets the tone for what follows.  Later in the episode, Aharen's generosity is put to work again when she realizes Raido is unaware of his pants being unzipped. She feels bad for him but, as a girl with some dandere elements, she is too shy to speak up and make Raido self-conscious. Instead, Aharen tirelessly stands before him or moves objects around so students and teachers cannot see Raido's embarrassing little secret. Aharen never ends up explaining herself, so a mystified Raido goes home, only for his little sister to immediately point out the issue. Aharen may be a generous and compassionate kuudere, but her dandere side ensures that Raido won't easily appreicate the true depths of her kindness. As far as he knows, Aharen is simply a silent goofball who acts on her every whim.  RELATED: Spy x Family's Premiere Introduces the World's Most Adorably Awkward Father-Daughter Duo                The amusing antics of Episode 2 may act as important clues for how the relationship between Raido and Aharen may develop from this point forward. The two of them are already establishing their dynamic as friends who appreciate one another. But they are still figuring each other out at the same time. This is fairly common in shojo-style shonen stories like Aharen-San, where the two protagonists quickly form a stable relationship but still have a lot of work ahead of them. Something similar takes place in Komi Can't Communicate which, incidentally, also streams in the spring 2022 anime season. If it's not a whirlwind \"will they won't they\" romance, then the conflict must come from somewhere else.  Instead of battling one another, such as Raku and Chitoge in Nisekoi, Raido and Aharen take the Komi/Tadano route. They struggle not to accept one another or to form a genuine relationship, but to figure out each other's idiosyncracies, secrets, and subtle emotions. It's a story of mutual discovery, and Aharen's shyness and Raido's obliviousness serve as the main obstacles. These two high school students want to deepen their friendship and understand each other better, but at this rate, it'll take a lot of time and effort. If Aharen can't even say \"your pants are unzipped,\" then she's got her work cut out for her. But that doesn't mean she's going to give up. Not by a long shot.

Kiara Halls Apr 5, 2022                      Star Trek: The Motion Picture Remaster Reforges the Movie\u2019s Legacy  The 4K UHD remaster of the overlooked Star Trek: The Motion Picture director's cut proves to be the definitive version of the film.  Sam Stone Apr 5, 2022                      The Bubble\u2019s Misstepped Comedy Sacrifices Its Stars\u2019 Potential  Judd Apatow delivers a series of predictable showbiz jokes through talented actors playing an unlikeable cast in Netflix\u2019s The Bubble.  Josh Bell Apr 1, 2022                      Morbius\u2019 Rushed & Muddled Story Won\u2019t Quench Audiences' Thirst  Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be.  Sam Stone Mar 31, 2022                      The Contractor Drops Chris Pine in a Generic Spy Thriller With Little Depth  The Contractor is a standard spy story that makes an effort to engage with deeper themes about the treatment of veterans but falls short.  Josh Bell Mar 30, 2022                      Barbarians Compellingly Tackles Toxic Masculinity But Misses Its Landing  IFC Midnight's Barbarians examines toxic masculinity through the lens of a home invasion thriller that ultimately muddles its messaging.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 30, 2022                      Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out  Night's End brings a lot of intriguing ideas to the surface around the strange powers of isolation but it ultimately doesn't stick its landing.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 29, 2022                      Nitram Offers No Valuable Perspective On a Horrific, Real-Life Tragedy  Director Justin Kurzel's Nitram is somber and pointless. It neither honors victims of a real-life mass shooting nor asks for social change.  Josh Bell Mar 28, 2022                      Morbius' Creepy Motion Poster Is a Terrifying Sight  A terrifying motion poster for Sony and Marvel's Morbius brings the vampiric antihero to life.   Samuel Gelman Mar 22, 2022                      Measure of Revenge\u2019s Muddled Ambitions Lead to a Middling Thriller  Measure of Revenge features some interesting moments and a strong female lead but gets muddled in too many genres and styles to truly land.  Jon Mendelsohn Mar 21, 2022                      REVIEW: Umma Teases a Provocative Story But Overuses Haunted House Tropes  Although Umma opens as a film that's easy to root for -- due to its complex story and unique imagery -- it relies too much on haunted house tropes.  Caitlin Chappell Mar 21, 2022                      Everything Everywhere All At Once Flaunts Michelle Yeoh's Unmatched Star Power  A24's Everything Everywhere All At Once is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, filled with fantastic action set-pieces and loads of heart.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 21, 2022                      Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood Charmingly Melds Nostalgia & Space Fantasy  Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood is a quirky, delightful combination of a realistic \u201860s coming-of-age story with a boy\u2019s space fantasy.  Reuben Baron Mar 21, 2022                      The Lost City Elevates a Standard Plot With Humor & Chemistry  The Lost City's endearing characters, strong performances, and enthusiastic embrace of genre tropes elevate a by-the-numbers plot.  Brandon Zachary Mar 18, 2022                      Windfall Channels the Suspense & Wit of Vintage Thrillers  Full of dry, dark humor, Netflix's Windfall evokes vintage noir and suspense thrillers, with a slight modern strain of social commentary.  Josh Bell Mar 18, 2022                      REVIEW: Ti West's X Serves a Fun & Sensual Bloodbath With a Killer Message  From its opening scene, Ti West's X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 17, 2022                      Cheaper By the Dozen\u2019s Wholesome Family Delivers a Feel-Good Story  Disney+'s Cheaper By the Dozen reimagines the Baker family for a more representative and recognizable story about the power of familial love.

Home Anime How to Get Started With Highschool of the Dead    How to Get Started With Highschool of the Dead  By Gregory Segal Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Highschool of the Dead has been a cult classic for over 15-years! Here's some tips to make it easier to pick up copies of the manga or anime.                 Despite the short length and the sudden end of Highschool of the Dead it has managed to gain cult-like status within the manga and anime community. The show has been well regarded both critically and by fans for its unique take on the horror genre, with its mix of intense action, humor, and raunchy female characters.  While the series has not received any additions since 2013, it is thankfully still widely available. Both the manga and anime can be purchased in digital and physical formats and the prices that are attached to these items are generally very reasonable at the time of this article's publication. However, certain copies are seemingly disappearing quite quickly and there appears to be no upcoming restock of these items. So, here\u2019s a guide on where you can pick up the series before it\u2019s all too late! RELATED: Where Is Deku's Father in My Hero Academia?          The Plot of Highschool of the Dead                Highschool of the Dead is set in modern-day Japan, during the outset of a deadly worldwide pandemic that turns humans into zombies. The story follows a group of high school students and their school\u2019s nurse as they try to escape their school and survive the deadly hordes of the dead that are around every corner. Throughout the show, they must learn to deal with their own emotions, the decay of their moral values, and how best to deal with one another in an effort to increase their chances of survival. Along the way, they encounter a variety of different challenges from dangerous fellow survivors to how best to help those in dire need. As the series progresses each character develops their skills and increases in confidence as they manage to overcome situations that they otherwise believed to be impossible.  RELATED: Is Doron Dororon Going Too Fast?          Where to Read the Highschool of the Dead Manga                Highschool of the Dead was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's Monthly Dragon Age between its September 2006 and May 2013 issues. The manga was written by Daisuke Sat\u014d and illustrated by Sh\u014dji Sat\u014d. The series would later be published by Fujimi Shobo and Kadokawa Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes from March 2007 and April 2011 in Japan, which were developed by Yen Press for the series\u2019 North American release. Unfortunately, due to Sat\u014d\u2019s poor health and eventual death in 2017, the series was left unfinished.  A full-color version of the manga, titled Highschool of the Dead: Full-Color Edition, was first serialized in February 2011 by Monthly Dragon Age. In North America, the color edition began its release a month late in the March 2011 issue of Yen Press' Yen Plus online magazine and ran until July 2011. They would later be published in the form of two hardcover omnibuses, which were released between November 2011 and December 2013. RELATED: The Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones                 Readers have three primary options available to them if they want to read the manga, with each depending on their preference. Firstly, it is still possible to pick up the seven tank\u014dbon volumes, although you will likely have to shop around since the majority of online vendors only have certain volumes in stock. Amazon, Bookshop.org, Barnes & Noble, AbeBooks, and Rightstuf are all possible options for exploration, where volumes range in price from being as cheap as $4.60 to $14.99 (not including shipping). Sadly, there has not been a box set release, so if you\u2019re looking to grab the entire set in one fell swoop, you will likely have to keep your eyes on sites like eBay to do this.  However, for those who are interested in not waiting around to buy the entire series, then the Highschool of the Dead: Full-Color Edition is likely your best bet. These can be picked up at most of the aforementioned stores and will cost anywhere between $45 to $60 per copy (of which there are two). Lastly, If your preference is to read manga digitally then you can quickly pick up each individual volume to read through Kindle or Comixology on Amazon for just under $10. However, these digital editions can also be found more cheaply on Apple\u2019s iBooks and Rakuten Kobo for $6.99.

Here's some tips to make it easier to pick up copies of the manga or anime.                 Despite the short length and the sudden end of Highschool of the Dead it has managed to gain cult-like status within the manga and anime community. The show has been well regarded both critically and by fans for its unique take on the horror genre, with its mix of intense action, humor, and raunchy female characters.  While the series has not received any additions since 2013, it is thankfully still widely available. Both the manga and anime can be purchased in digital and physical formats and the prices that are attached to these items are generally very reasonable at the time of this article's publication. However, certain copies are seemingly disappearing quite quickly and there appears to be no upcoming restock of these items. So, here\u2019s a guide on where you can pick up the series before it\u2019s all too late! RELATED: Where Is Deku's Father in My Hero Academia?          The Plot of Highschool of the Dead                Highschool of the Dead is set in modern-day Japan, during the outset of a deadly worldwide pandemic that turns humans into zombies. The story follows a group of high school students and their school\u2019s nurse as they try to escape their school and survive the deadly hordes of the dead that are around every corner. Throughout the show, they must learn to deal with their own emotions, the decay of their moral values, and how best to deal with one another in an effort to increase their chances of survival. Along the way, they encounter a variety of different challenges from dangerous fellow survivors to how best to help those in dire need. As the series progresses each character develops their skills and increases in confidence as they manage to overcome situations that they otherwise believed to be impossible.  RELATED: Is Doron Dororon Going Too Fast?          Where to Read the Highschool of the Dead Manga                Highschool of the Dead was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's Monthly Dragon Age between its September 2006 and May 2013 issues. The manga was written by Daisuke Sat\u014d and illustrated by Sh\u014dji Sat\u014d. The series would later be published by Fujimi Shobo and Kadokawa Shoten in seven tank\u014dbon volumes from March 2007 and April 2011 in Japan, which were developed by Yen Press for the series\u2019 North American release. Unfortunately, due to Sat\u014d\u2019s poor health and eventual death in 2017, the series was left unfinished.  A full-color version of the manga, titled Highschool of the Dead: Full-Color Edition, was first serialized in February 2011 by Monthly Dragon Age. In North America, the color edition began its release a month late in the March 2011 issue of Yen Press' Yen Plus online magazine and ran until July 2011. They would later be published in the form of two hardcover omnibuses, which were released between November 2011 and December 2013. RELATED: The Best Slice-of-Life Anime With Dark Undertones                 Readers have three primary options available to them if they want to read the manga, with each depending on their preference. Firstly, it is still possible to pick up the seven tank\u014dbon volumes, although you will likely have to shop around since the majority of online vendors only have certain volumes in stock. Amazon, Bookshop.org, Barnes & Noble, AbeBooks, and Rightstuf are all possible options for exploration, where volumes range in price from being as cheap as $4.60 to $14.99 (not including shipping). Sadly, there has not been a box set release, so if you\u2019re looking to grab the entire set in one fell swoop, you will likely have to keep your eyes on sites like eBay to do this.  However, for those who are interested in not waiting around to buy the entire series, then the Highschool of the Dead: Full-Color Edition is likely your best bet. These can be picked up at most of the aforementioned stores and will cost anywhere between $45 to $60 per copy (of which there are two). Lastly, If your preference is to read manga digitally then you can quickly pick up each individual volume to read through Kindle or Comixology on Amazon for just under $10. However, these digital editions can also be found more cheaply on Apple\u2019s iBooks and Rakuten Kobo for $6.99.

Heroines Run the Show has just begun airing as part of the packed Spring 2022 anime season, but believe it or not, it's the latest installment of a much bigger universe. So big, in fact, that it's been around for more than ten years.  Here's a quick run-down of the world spun by Honeyworks, and how newcomers and veteran fans alike can get started with each area of the sprawling anime, manga and music franchise. RELATED: Pok\u00e9mon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media          Who and What Is Honeyworks?                 Honeyworks is an independent music circle comprised three core members: the composers Gom and Shito and their illustrator, Yamako. They got their start by producing music through the popular vocal synthesizing software, VOCALOID. They first started producing music in 2010 and released their first full album in 2011.  In 2014, the trio collaborated with the singer CHICO and formed the new unit CHICO with Honeyworks. They would go on to perform several opening and ending themes for a number of popular anime, including Haikyuu!!, Gintama and Magic Kaito. RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre          Honeyworks' Connection to Famous Anime Voice Actors - and Hatsune Miku                Honeyworks have released numerous music videos since their debut, but their best-known works are part of a large, ongoing continuity titled Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The series details the love lives of several different teenagers who all happen to attend the same high school. It brings focus to different kinds of love: romantic, platonic and even unrequited. The core cast consists of six characters: Miou, Haruki, Natsuki, Yuu, Souta and Akari, as they stumble through awkward confessions and first dates up to their graduation ceremony.  There is a proper order to watch the videos, and they can all be viewed for free on Honeyworks' official YouTube channel. Be warned, however: not all of the available videos have English subtitles. All the main characters have at least one song centered on them, starting with Love's Picture Book. The songs were initially performed by virtual singers, including GUMI, Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Len and vFlower. As the series gained more popularity, Honeyworks eventually switched to using human singers more often, managing to get well-known talents in the voice acting industry like Yuki Kaji, Haruka Toumatsu and Natsuki Hanae.  Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~ is both a spin-off and a sequel that takes place roughly a year after the cast of Love Series have graduated. It focuses on several up-and-coming idols as they juggle celebrity life with their own personal drama and a dash of romance. Characters from the Love Series make frequent appearances and while knowledge of their origins is recommended, it isn't necessary to fully enjoy this follow-up.

Heroines Run the Show has just begun airing as part of the packed Spring 2022 anime season, but believe it or not, it's the latest installment of a much bigger universe. So big, in fact, that it's been around for more than ten years.  Here's a quick run-down of the world spun by Honeyworks, and how newcomers and veteran fans alike can get started with each area of the sprawling anime, manga and music franchise. RELATED: Pok\u00e9mon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media          Who and What Is Honeyworks?                 Honeyworks is an independent music circle comprised three core members: the composers Gom and Shito and their illustrator, Yamako. They got their start by producing music through the popular vocal synthesizing software, VOCALOID. They first started producing music in 2010 and released their first full album in 2011.  In 2014, the trio collaborated with the singer CHICO and formed the new unit CHICO with Honeyworks. They would go on to perform several opening and ending themes for a number of popular anime, including Haikyuu!!, Gintama and Magic Kaito. RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre          Honeyworks' Connection to Famous Anime Voice Actors - and Hatsune Miku                Honeyworks have released numerous music videos since their debut, but their best-known works are part of a large, ongoing continuity titled Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The series details the love lives of several different teenagers who all happen to attend the same high school. It brings focus to different kinds of love: romantic, platonic and even unrequited. The core cast consists of six characters: Miou, Haruki, Natsuki, Yuu, Souta and Akari, as they stumble through awkward confessions and first dates up to their graduation ceremony.  There is a proper order to watch the videos, and they can all be viewed for free on Honeyworks' official YouTube channel. Be warned, however: not all of the available videos have English subtitles. All the main characters have at least one song centered on them, starting with Love's Picture Book. The songs were initially performed by virtual singers, including GUMI, Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Len and vFlower. As the series gained more popularity, Honeyworks eventually switched to using human singers more often, managing to get well-known talents in the voice acting industry like Yuki Kaji, Haruka Toumatsu and Natsuki Hanae.  Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~ is both a spin-off and a sequel that takes place roughly a year after the cast of Love Series have graduated. It focuses on several up-and-coming idols as they juggle celebrity life with their own personal drama and a dash of romance. Characters from the Love Series make frequent appearances and while knowledge of their origins is recommended, it isn't necessary to fully enjoy this follow-up. Unlike its predecessor, there isn't a very clear starting point for the ~Idol Series~ music videos. While it's generally recommended to start with LIPxLIP's Romeo, most of the songs can be watched in any order.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Where to Watch & Read Honeyworks' Anime & Manga Adaptations                There have been two film adaptations and an eight-episode anime based on Confession Executive Committee ~Love Series~. The first two films, I've Always Liked You and The Moment You Fall in Love, can be watched in release order followed by the anime, Our Love Has Always Been 10 Centimeters Apart. While the anime is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, both films were removed from the Crunchyroll library in May 2021 and are currently unavailable for streaming or purchase.  As for the Confession Executive Committee ~Idol Series~, there has been a film adaptation that focuses on the idol unit LIPxLIP titled Kono Sekai no Tanoshimikata: Secret Story Film (How to Enjoy This World: Secret Story Film). The film has yet to be picked up for streaming by any platforms. Finally, the latest anime adaptation that started airing this Spring, Heroines Run the Show, acts as a direct sequel to the film and focuses on the idol unit's manager, the plucky country girl Hiyori. It is currently available for streaming on Crunchyroll. RELATED: What Music-Inspired Anime to Watch After takt op.Destiny                 In addition to all the anime adaptations, there have also been a number of novel and manga series, some either acting as direct adaptations of the source material or chronicling entirely new side stories. There are even a number of audio drama CDs, albums featuring all-new music performed by the anime's cast, and a mobile phone game that's still currently in service. Unfortunately, none of these supplemental materials have been officially licensed and translated outside of Japan. But possibly the most impressive piece of official media to have come out of this franchise would be the live concerts. The idol units created by Honeyworks appear on stage and perform via hologram projection, not unlike a typical Hatsune Miku concert.  Honeyworks has created a lovable shojo universe that seems to be growing bigger every year. There's a lot to dig into here, and this is just scratching the surface. But if one has the time and an insatiable hankering for something sweet and fluffy, then by all means, dig deeper.

Chapter 350 fixes that, but some things about the original actually look better.                  The following contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapters 349 and 350, by K\u014dhei Horikoshi, available in English from Viz Media.   Dabi has always been an unsettling presence in My Hero Academia, even among the rogues' gallery. His Cremation Quirk burns so intensely that it chars his own flesh, which is why so much of his skin is grafted onto his body. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the latest chapters of MHA, 349-350. Here, Dabi's graft was burned off and the true scope of his injuries was on gruesome display. The shots that present this best are meant to mirror one another, but they're imprecise for one simple reason: Chapter 349 is unfinished.  For whatever reason, creator Kohei Horikoshi couldn't complete the final panel of MHA Chapter 349, \"Battle Flame,\" in time for publication. Because of that, only the basic sketch is on the page. That will probably change with the volume release, but, for now, it offers a glimpse into how Dabi was supposed to appear before his look was finalized in Chapter 350, \"Bound to a Fiery Fate.\" In some ways, the unfinished version is actually scarier than his finished look. RELATED: My Hero Academia Is Primed for Its Biggest Shout-Out to a Fan Animator                The most notable feature of Dabi's new look is the exposure of his jaw muscles. Apparently, his burns have reached as far as the muscle. In the unfinished version, the muscle fibers are more pronounced. In the finished version, these muscles are \"colored in,\" which obscures them and even makes them look a little less like muscles. It's almost like this feature was toned down for the latter image.  RELATED: How My Hero Academia's Gran Torino Connects Directly to Star Wars Another thing that sticks out is the way Dabi's teeth are drawn. In Chapter 349, his teeth have a more rugged look and are more exposed; his lower jawbone also seems to be slightly visible. In Chapter 350, his teeth are cleaned up, and his jawbone seems to be covered by his gums. In fairness, the teeth were probably always meant to look cleaner in the final version of Chapter 349, too.                 Most of this makes the rough drawing sound superior, but the finished product comes with its perks, too. For one thing, it's easier to distinguish between Dabi's grafted skin and his exposed tissue; the rough sketch almost makes them look one and the same. It also gives a better look at more than just his face; apparently, his exposed flesh runs as far down as the back of his neck, probably even further. As cool as Dabi looks in his rough sketch, finishing the picture might have been for the best.  Chapter 349 and 350's depictions of Dabi both have their own strengths and weaknesses. In Chapter 349, he looks gnarlier but less refined. In Chapter 350, his features have been toned down, but they're also easier to make out in most ways. Which image sells Dabi's creep factor better is really up to the opinion of the reader. In any case, they'll probably find a way to tone all this down even more for the anime.

Here are all their previous meetings in One-Punch Man.                  The following contains spoilers for Chapter 159 of One-Punch Man, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English via Viz Media.   Fans of One-Punch Man have long seen similarities in Garo and Saitama. Garo's drive for power and exponential growth have made many wonder if the Hero Hunter will one day be able to match the Bald Cape's power level, which only adds further hype for future meetings. While their most recent encounter is the most exciting yet, it is not the first time they've exchanged blows.  Garo already has a history of assaulting Saitama, though none of his attacks have actually hurt the hero. Saitama is also yet to exert any effort in fending off the Hero Hunter. Here is every moment these two have made contact so far in One-Punch Man. RELATED:How One Piece's Earlier Arcs Prove Luffy Is the Best User of His Devil Fruit          Garo Interrupts Saitama While Shopping for a Wig                 After learning of a possible cash prize, Saitama agreed to take part in a martial arts competition in Charanko's stead. He then started looking for a wig to make his disguise more convincing. Meanwhile, Garo was walking in the Entertainment District when he saw a particular member of the Hero Association bragging about his status to some ladies. When the poor guy offered to introduce the girls to Sweet Mask, Garo appeared and knocked him out. That was when Saitama appeared.  Saitama commented about finding the right one after looking everywhere, which Garo assumed to be in reference to him. Thinking the Bald Cape was a hero who was keeping an eye on him, the Hero Hunter launched a quick hand chop. The attack was strong enough to nail Saitama to the ground -- however, annoyed by the sudden interruption of his shopping, Saitama returned the same blow and knocked out Garo. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died          Garo Tries to Assault The Strongest Man                 Saitama and Garo's second meeting in One-Punch Man came when the Bald Cape protected King from the Hero Hunter's attack. Back then Saitama was opening up to King about his woes, discussing the lack of excitement that accompanied being unparalleled. While King initially thought Saitama was referring to his hair, he did offer his friend some meaningful advice -- which he stole from some manga.  At that time, Garo was suffering from the injuries he'd sustained from fighting Watchdog Man. Garo spotted King and Saitama walking together but his eyes were focused on the former, whom he wanted to hunt. He claimed to not feel any pain and rushed toward King -- but before he could strike, Saitama had already kicked Garo into a wall. RELATED:One-Punch Man: A Dark & Twisted Backstory Led to Genos Becoming a Cyborg          Garo Dines and Dashes - and So Does Saitama                 Garo and Saitama's third meeting is more comedic than the first two. Saitama had just finished eating when he realized he didn't have his wallet with him. Just as he was contemplating his life decisions, Blizzard came in to ask him to join her group. Saitama had other plans, however; he ordered another plate of fries and offered it to Blizzard, which the latter gratefully accepted. As if on cue, the announcement of Garo dining and dashing came. Saitama left within a heartbeat in pursuit of Garo, leaving Blizzard to pay the bill.  Garo witnessed Tareo being bullied and decided to help the kid, allowing Saitama to catch up to him. But instead of capturing Garo, the Bald Cape simply let him off with a warning. The Hero Hunter took this as the hero pitying him, so he went to punch Saitama. Afraid of getting in trouble for being an accomplice, Saitama reflexively punched the Hero Hunter, once again knocking him out. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task          Garo and Saitama's Most-Anticipated Battle Yet                 Garo and Saitama's most recent meeting in One-Punch Man came when they took out Centisennin and Evil Ocean Water respectively. Saitama went to Garo, thinking he was the Monster King. Garo indeed introduced himself as a monster and went on to rant about being the absolute evil. The Bald Cape ignored him, thinking he wasn't really a monster. Garo, ticked by Saitama's lack of care, launched a sneak attack -- only to be sent flying by Saitama's reflexive punch.

Here are all their previous meetings in One-Punch Man.                  The following contains spoilers for Chapter 159 of One-Punch Man, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English via Viz Media.   Fans of One-Punch Man have long seen similarities in Garo and Saitama. Garo's drive for power and exponential growth have made many wonder if the Hero Hunter will one day be able to match the Bald Cape's power level, which only adds further hype for future meetings. While their most recent encounter is the most exciting yet, it is not the first time they've exchanged blows.  Garo already has a history of assaulting Saitama, though none of his attacks have actually hurt the hero. Saitama is also yet to exert any effort in fending off the Hero Hunter. Here is every moment these two have made contact so far in One-Punch Man. RELATED:How One Piece's Earlier Arcs Prove Luffy Is the Best User of His Devil Fruit          Garo Interrupts Saitama While Shopping for a Wig                 After learning of a possible cash prize, Saitama agreed to take part in a martial arts competition in Charanko's stead. He then started looking for a wig to make his disguise more convincing. Meanwhile, Garo was walking in the Entertainment District when he saw a particular member of the Hero Association bragging about his status to some ladies. When the poor guy offered to introduce the girls to Sweet Mask, Garo appeared and knocked him out. That was when Saitama appeared.  Saitama commented about finding the right one after looking everywhere, which Garo assumed to be in reference to him. Thinking the Bald Cape was a hero who was keeping an eye on him, the Hero Hunter launched a quick hand chop. The attack was strong enough to nail Saitama to the ground -- however, annoyed by the sudden interruption of his shopping, Saitama returned the same blow and knocked out Garo.

Back then Saitama was opening up to King about his woes, discussing the lack of excitement that accompanied being unparalleled. While King initially thought Saitama was referring to his hair, he did offer his friend some meaningful advice -- which he stole from some manga.  At that time, Garo was suffering from the injuries he'd sustained from fighting Watchdog Man. Garo spotted King and Saitama walking together but his eyes were focused on the former, whom he wanted to hunt. He claimed to not feel any pain and rushed toward King -- but before he could strike, Saitama had already kicked Garo into a wall. RELATED:One-Punch Man: A Dark & Twisted Backstory Led to Genos Becoming a Cyborg          Garo Dines and Dashes - and So Does Saitama                 Garo and Saitama's third meeting is more comedic than the first two. Saitama had just finished eating when he realized he didn't have his wallet with him. Just as he was contemplating his life decisions, Blizzard came in to ask him to join her group. Saitama had other plans, however; he ordered another plate of fries and offered it to Blizzard, which the latter gratefully accepted. As if on cue, the announcement of Garo dining and dashing came. Saitama left within a heartbeat in pursuit of Garo, leaving Blizzard to pay the bill.  Garo witnessed Tareo being bullied and decided to help the kid, allowing Saitama to catch up to him. But instead of capturing Garo, the Bald Cape simply let him off with a warning. The Hero Hunter took this as the hero pitying him, so he went to punch Saitama. Afraid of getting in trouble for being an accomplice, Saitama reflexively punched the Hero Hunter, once again knocking him out. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task          Garo and Saitama's Most-Anticipated Battle Yet                 Garo and Saitama's most recent meeting in One-Punch Man came when they took out Centisennin and Evil Ocean Water respectively. Saitama went to Garo, thinking he was the Monster King. Garo indeed introduced himself as a monster and went on to rant about being the absolute evil. The Bald Cape ignored him, thinking he wasn't really a monster. Garo, ticked by Saitama's lack of care, launched a sneak attack -- only to be sent flying by Saitama's reflexive punch.

Home Anime Bakuman Is a Great Anime With Problematic Characterization    Bakuman Is a Great Anime With Problematic Characterization  By Gregory Segal Published 4 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   While Bakuman offers an in-depth look into the world of mangaka, its female characters, Azuki and Kaya, are reduced to a series of frustrating tropes.                 Bakuman, written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from August 2008 to April 2012. The series would later be adapted into a 75-episode anime which has garnered both commercial and critical success.  The series has certainly been deserving of the adoration it has received, with its accurate portrayal of what it\u2019s like to work in the manga industry to a plethora of well-written characters and storylines. However, over the years many people have noticed the problematic characterization of Bakuman\u2019s female leads, Azuki and Kaya. RELATED: Spy x Family: Twilight's Backstory Reveals His Complicated Relationship With His Father                This isn\u2019t the first time that this mangaka team has been criticized for their poor construction of female characters. From the sexualization of Death Note\u2019s Misa Amane to the absence of a real identity for Saki Hanakago in Platinum End, Ohba and Obata seemingly lack the skills to create female characters that impact their stories or have enough identifiable traits to make them relatable.  In Bakuman, Azuki and Kaya are no exception. While these characters possess their own dreams and values, they are rarely developed upon and are instead used in tandem with the goals of the series\u2019 male protagonists to advance the narrative. Although it would be unfair to expect each and every character within the show to have an equal level of progression, for such important characters it seems strange that they have simply been reduced to a bundle of tropes and plot devices, with little agency or complexity. RELATED:I\u2019m Quitting Heroing Shows What Happens After the Final Boss Battle                  The main purpose for the existence of Bakuman\u2019s female characters is to create a romantic storyline for Mashiro and Takagi. After Mashiro falls head over heels for Azuki, the couple promises that they will not get married (and even limit their interactions to texting) until they have achieved their dream of Mashiro\u2019s manga being adapted into an anime that stars Azuki as its female lead. While certainly a little strange, there is nothing inherently wrong with this in itself. However, what becomes difficult to understand is why Azuki\u2019s entire life direction, personality, and impact on the story revolve around her love interest. Although a degree of influence can be expected to come from such a Romeo and Juliet-styled infatuation, Azuki\u2019s lack of agency is completely nonsensical and diminishes the authenticity of what is often a slice-of-life story.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Is Kid Trunks & Mai's Bond Harmless or Problematic?                 The characterization of Kaya is equally flawed. Despite having a fierce independent streak and fiery temperament, Kaya is cheapened to serving Takagi\u2019s every need even though he rarely pays her any attention. She is often portrayed as an obstacle for Takagi and his work, whether it\u2019s requesting him to take time off to go out on a date or for him to help her with writing online fiction. She is more of a nuisance to Takagi than a partner. While this might have served as an excellent opportunity to comment on the difficulties of work-life balance in Japan or provide an acute examination of the traditional housewife, Ohba instead offers a rather two-dimensional perspective. The audience is left with a half-baked and one-sided relationship that is seemingly meant to inspire, yet more readily depresses, as Kaya is reduced to carrying out menial tasks and shadows her husband's every move.  RELATED:Why Chainsaw Man\u2019s Latest Chapter is For Adult Readers Only                 For a series that contains as much attention to detail as Bakuman does, it\u2019s rather baffling that more time couldn\u2019t be spent on developing its female characters. As an audience, we\u2019re supposed to root for these characters to succeed and for their relationships to blossom. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to do since both Azuki and Kaya bear little-to-no personalities and are stuck in what can largely be regarded as toxic relationships. The characterizations of Azuki and Kaya are so out of place, that some fans have speculated that instead of complacency on behalf of the writer, the inclusion of tropes and static personalities is a form of meta-commentary on the traditional portrayal of women in shonen manga. The reason for Azuki, Kaya, and other female characters' representation as prizes for male characters or general mood dampeners is a way to express the array of traditional archetypes that often appear in this medium. Consequently, Bakuman\u2019s use of these oversimplified and stilted characterizations could possibly be viewed as a form of commentary and criticism.  Whether this is or isn\u2019t the case certainly remains to be seen. However, regardless of this theory, Azuki and Kaya are horribly under-written characters and are arguably the weakest element within the series. If were intended as a method of criticism or parody on shonen tropes, then there surely would have been better ways to incorporate this, without diminishing the series\u2019 plot or ability to create relatable and exciting female characters.

Bakuman, written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from August 2008 to April 2012. The series would later be adapted into a 75-episode anime which has garnered both commercial and critical success.  The series has certainly been deserving of the adoration it has received, with its accurate portrayal of what it\u2019s like to work in the manga industry to a plethora of well-written characters and storylines. However, over the years many people have noticed the problematic characterization of Bakuman\u2019s female leads, Azuki and Kaya. RELATED: Spy x Family: Twilight's Backstory Reveals His Complicated Relationship With His Father                This isn\u2019t the first time that this mangaka team has been criticized for their poor construction of female characters. From the sexualization of Death Note\u2019s Misa Amane to the absence of a real identity for Saki Hanakago in Platinum End, Ohba and Obata seemingly lack the skills to create female characters that impact their stories or have enough identifiable traits to make them relatable.  In Bakuman, Azuki and Kaya are no exception. While these characters possess their own dreams and values, they are rarely developed upon and are instead used in tandem with the goals of the series\u2019 male protagonists to advance the narrative. Although it would be unfair to expect each and every character within the show to have an equal level of progression, for such important characters it seems strange that they have simply been reduced to a bundle of tropes and plot devices, with little agency or complexity. RELATED:I\u2019m Quitting Heroing Shows What Happens After the Final Boss Battle                  The main purpose for the existence of Bakuman\u2019s female characters is to create a romantic storyline for Mashiro and Takagi. After Mashiro falls head over heels for Azuki, the couple promises that they will not get married (and even limit their interactions to texting) until they have achieved their dream of Mashiro\u2019s manga being adapted into an anime that stars Azuki as its female lead. While certainly a little strange, there is nothing inherently wrong with this in itself. However, what becomes difficult to understand is why Azuki\u2019s entire life direction, personality, and impact on the story revolve around her love interest. Although a degree of influence can be expected to come from such a Romeo and Juliet-styled infatuation, Azuki\u2019s lack of agency is completely nonsensical and diminishes the authenticity of what is often a slice-of-life story.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Is Kid Trunks & Mai's Bond Harmless or Problematic?                 The characterization of Kaya is equally flawed. Despite having a fierce independent streak and fiery temperament, Kaya is cheapened to serving Takagi\u2019s every need even though he rarely pays her any attention. She is often portrayed as an obstacle for Takagi and his work, whether it\u2019s requesting him to take time off to go out on a date or for him to help her with writing online fiction. She is more of a nuisance to Takagi than a partner. While this might have served as an excellent opportunity to comment on the difficulties of work-life balance in Japan or provide an acute examination of the traditional housewife, Ohba instead offers a rather two-dimensional perspective. The audience is left with a half-baked and one-sided relationship that is seemingly meant to inspire, yet more readily depresses, as Kaya is reduced to carrying out menial tasks and shadows her husband's every move.  RELATED:Why Chainsaw Man\u2019s Latest Chapter is For Adult Readers Only                 For a series that contains as much attention to detail as Bakuman does, it\u2019s rather baffling that more time couldn\u2019t be spent on developing its female characters. As an audience, we\u2019re supposed to root for these characters to succeed and for their relationships to blossom. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to do since both Azuki and Kaya bear little-to-no personalities and are stuck in what can largely be regarded as toxic relationships. The characterizations of Azuki and Kaya are so out of place, that some fans have speculated that instead of complacency on behalf of the writer, the inclusion of tropes and static personalities is a form of meta-commentary on the traditional portrayal of women in shonen manga. The reason for Azuki, Kaya, and other female characters' representation as prizes for male characters or general mood dampeners is a way to express the array of traditional archetypes that often appear in this medium. Consequently, Bakuman\u2019s use of these oversimplified and stilted characterizations could possibly be viewed as a form of commentary and criticism.  Whether this is or isn\u2019t the case certainly remains to be seen. However, regardless of this theory, Azuki and Kaya are horribly under-written characters and are arguably the weakest element within the series. If were intended as a method of criticism or parody on shonen tropes, then there surely would have been better ways to incorporate this, without diminishing the series\u2019 plot or ability to create relatable and exciting female characters.

But Oshiro doesn't like Raido very much.                  The following contains spoilers for Episode 2 of Aharen-San is Indecipherable, \"Are We Being Followed?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Aharen-San is Indecipherable is a brand-new rom-com anime series in the Spring 2022 anime season, starring the petite Aharen Rain and her platonic male friend and classmate Raido. They befriended one another in Episode 1 as neighbors in class, but now in Episode 2, another character joins Aharen's tiny social circle.  Oshiro is a timid girl who has always watched over Aharen like a protective mother -- a dutiful self-appointed guardian who fears big guys like Raido. In Episode 2, Oshigo makes her presence known to Raido, and when they confront one another, a misunderstanding ensues. Raido's new friendship with Aharen certainly comes with its fair share of baggage. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                In Episode 2 of Aharen-San, Raido and Aharen continue to slowly and sweetly develop their budding friendship, and already, Aharen makes it clear that Raido is special to her. Aharen is a shy kuudere-type character who feels strong affection for others but has trouble expressing it, but all the same, her actions often speak louder than words. For now, Raido is too dense to realize how much Aharen cares for him, but he might pick up on that eventually. Meanwhile, another girl, Oshiro, picks up on it immediately. She can tell that Aharen and Raido are spending an awful lot of time together lately, so she must do something.  In Episode 2, Oshiro constantly spies on Raido, and during lunch, Oshiro finally confronts him while taking Aharen's side. Oshiro explains that she has always watched over Aharen to protect her from scary people, and she believes that the rather brawny Raido is dangerous. Oshiro clearly means well, but both Raido and Aharen assure her that there's nothing to be worried about. Raido is a gentle giant who treats Aharen well, and in return, Aharen is deeply fond of him. However, Oshiro isn't entirely convinced until the end of the episode, when she watches Raido and Aharen walking home together from afar. Oshiro still has those protective feelings, but if she's watching them from far enough to require binoculars, she's also too far away to intervene if things go wrong. Evidently, Oshiro no longer sees Raido as a threat to Aharen's safety, and that's progress -- granted, not much, but progress all the same.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward's Finale is Saved With the Power of Friendship                Oshiro's character arc is just beginning as of Episode 2 of Aharen-san is Indecipherble, but there are already some clues and hints as to what may be next for her and the rest of the cast. Characters like Oshiro don't easily give up on their defining character trait or attribute, even if these characters tone down their extreme behavior after their debut. Already, Oshiro trusts Raido a little more with Aharen, but it's unlikely that she will stop serving as Aharen's self-appointed guardian and mother hen anytime soon. She will likely keep this up, mainly for comic effect, but she might get more serious about it if other boys start hanging out with Aharen as well. Then Aharen might find herself explaining things all over again.  It's also possible that Oshiro may warm up to Raido and become his friend, although Aharen will probably always be number one in Oshiro's heart. Oshiro may decide that she's reluctant to have any boys around Aharen but that Raido can be the sole exception, and she might even trust him enough to have him share the duty of guarding Aharen. If so, that could strengthen Oshiro's and Raido's friendship, bonding over their mutual interest in Aharen. It also helps that Raido is a big and tough guy who could be intimidating if he wanted to, so Oshiro might value him as Aharen's best bodyguard from now on. Oshiro isn't big enough, strong enough or scary-looking enough to actually do much in Aharen's defense, so she can delegate that job to Raido to give herself some peace of mind. She certainly could use a break by now.

The following contains spoilers for Batman '89 #5, now on sale from DC Comics.   The typical versions of Batman's most consistent allies tend to not change much across adaptations. Characters like James Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth, and Dick Grayson fill consistent roles across mediums and universes although there are a few notable exceptions, such as evil versions of Grayson or dangerous takes on Alfred.  It's rare that a version of Gordon has been as beaten down as the one seen in Batman '89, and issue #5 (by Sam Hamm, Joe Quinones, Leonardo Ito, and Clayton Cowles) features one of the most bitter portrayals of the Gotham City Commissioner yet. RELATED: DC's Batman '89 Gives the Burton Batmobile a New, Hi-Tech Ability                 In the world of Batman '89, the Dark Knight found an ally in James Gordon. As in many realities, Gordon was one of Batman's only vocal supporters among the leaders of Gotham City, and in Batman Returns he was one of the only people keeping the GCPD from fully turning against the Caped Crusader. However, in the Batman '89 mini-series, Gordon's loyalty to the Gotham City vigilante has cost him.the respect of the city and his fellow officers, his leadership within the GCPD, and the admiration of his daughter Barbara.  In a conversation with Barbara during the opening pages of Batman '89 #5, Gordon admits that everything he did (including supporting Batman) came at too great of a cost, and his intentions to fight decisively against crime has just alienated everyone he cared about. In response, he's agreed to step away from the GCPD once and for all. But before he and Barbara can reach a peaceful agreement, Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, attacks the police department and captures Gordon. Initially, Dent's intention is to keep Gordon around as a valuable hostage, but after an intense argument with his former friend, the villain shoots him. As Gordon collapses, he notes that his possibly fatal injury is probably for the best, as this will likely be a breaking point for Barbara and fully turn her against Dent.  RELATED: The Newest Dark Knight's First Villain Draws Inspiration From Batman '89'S Joker                 This is a surprisingly bitter take on Gordon, who is usually one of Batman's more optimistic allies. While the lawman has plenty of experience dealing with the dark corners of Gotham, his faith in the system has typically been a defining aspect of the character. Even in his appearances in The Joker (which have seen him ruminate on the nature of evil and openly consider killing the Joker) Gordon has been consistent in his tenacity and commitment to justice. This version seems to have accepted his mistakes and elected to more or less give up on his mission.  This is certainly a dark take on an otherwise shining star, to the point where Gordon's efforts to get Dent to shoot him almost seem like a relief. It's a far cry from most portrayals of the character, who often remains one of the most steadfast moral guidelines in the DC Universe. But it seems that in this timeline, Gordon's resolve is spent, and even his most significant act is done more out of a sense of spite than actual heroism.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

A new One Piece Film: Red trailer released.  The new preview concentrates on the series' newest character, a young songstress named Uta. The singer is revealed to be the daughter of Red-Haired Shanks, the powerful captain who gave Luffy his iconic straw hat and inspired the boy to take up the life of a pirate. The trailer also features a few shots of Luffy in his new costume, which blends elements of classic pirate attire with punk rock stylings. The clip ends by confirming the movie's Japanese premiere date, Aug. 6. RELATED: One Piece Debuts New Straw Hat Pirates Costumes in Full Color    One Piece Film: Red is the 15th film in the long-running shonen adventure series. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island in order to attend a music festival. In addition to Luffy's new jacket and hat, the rest of the Straw Hat crew will also don new, musically-inspired costumes throughout the movie.  Production on the new film is being supervised by the manga's original creator, Eiichiro Oda. According to Oda, the movie was inspired by his desire to add this new character to the series' cast. The script for the new movie is being penned by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, who previously wrote One Piece Film: Gold. The new film is being directed by Code Geass' Goro Taniguchi.

The series was placed on indefinite hiatus after March 6, when Toei was the victim with a targeted ransomware attack that halted production on several of the studio's biggest projects, including the One Piece TV anime. Both One Piece and Digimon: Ghost Game will resume the broadcast of new episodes on April 17. However, Toei Animation's arguably biggest release of the year, the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, has yet to receive a new release date. Production on the movie was also stalled by the hack and it will no longer be released on its originally announced April 22 premiere date.  The One Piece manga is available in English from VIZ Media. The entire anime series is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, while select seasons and movies are also available on Netflix. Crunchyroll has confirmed it will resume its simulcast of the series as new episodes premiere in Japan.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Flashpoint Beyond #0, now on sale from DC ComicsThomas Wayne, the Batman of the Flashpoint Universe, returns to headline the new Flashpoint Beyond series by inadvertently causing the death of none other than the Flash -- also known as Barry Allen, who he worked alongside in 2011's original Flashpoint series.  Barry's death is a colossal misunderstanding resulting from Flashpoint Batman's efforts to understand the bizarre circumstances he finds himself in. During the original Flashpoint series, Thomas' alternate reality was created as a by-product of the mainstream DC Universe's Barry Allen running backward in time to stop the Reverse-Flash from killing his mother. In the resulting timeline that emerged from Barry's reality-shattering shenanigans, Bruce Wayne died in a mugger's attack while his father survived and became a vengeful, darker Batman. RELATED: DC\u2019s New Timeline's Name Comes With a Potentially Interesting Double Meaning  Throughout all five issues of Flashpoint, Thomas and Barry worked together to defeat Reverse-Flash and set reality straight. Flashpoint Beyond picks up where the series left off, featuring Thomas in what he believes is a newly-arranged universe where his son should be alive. Unfortunately, nothing seems to have changed in Thomas' world for the better, and as Thomas goes to confront Barry, he finds that the Flash who lives in his reconstructed existence has no memory of their time together, nor any connection with the Speed Force. Desperate for answers, Thomas subdues Barry and places him in an electric chair, hoping to activate his powers with a burst of lightning and a dose of chemicals. This is a nod not only to the Flash's origin but also to scenes in the original Flashpoint where Barry's speed went absent and needed multiple lightning strikes to reappear. Unfortunately, this time the procedure is far from successful, as a harpoon shatters the beakers containing the chemicals needed to trigger the Flash's transformation. Without them, the lightning fries Barry, leaving nothing but a sizzling corpse in its wake.

Stranger Things fans officially have their first look at Victor Creel, the murderous character horror legend Robert Englund will play in the Netflix show's upcoming fourth season.  Englund makes an appearance in the newly-released official trailer for Stranger Things Season 4, with his character's eyes seemingly being scarred shut. It was first announced in November 2020 that Englund had joined the cast of the 1980s-set Stranger Things as Victor Creel, \"a disturbed and intimidating man who is imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital for a gruesome murder in the 1950s.\" RELATED: Stranger Things Debuts Season 4's Terrifying New Villain                It's only fitting that Englund would portray a murderer in a story set in the Midwestern United States during the '80s. After all, the actor is perhaps best known for playing supernatural serial killer Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise from 1984 to 2003. For years, even after his death, Freddy terrorized the residents of Springwood, Ohio. Now, Englund takes his talents to Hawkins, Indiana for the fourth season of Stranger Things.  According to Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer, Englund himself approached them about joining the show's cast. \"The fact that he came to us in a season that's so deeply inspired by the Nightmare series and by his performance especially in those movies, it felt like fate,\" Matt told IGN. \"It felt like, 'Okay, this is meant to be.'\" RELATED: Stranger Things Season 4's Episodes Are 'Double' the Length of Previous Seasons The fourth season of Stranger Things has been split into two volumes. The first volume is set to premiere on Netflix on Friday, May 27. The second volume follows suit five weeks later on Friday, July 1. An official synopsis for the season reads as follows:  It's been six months since the Battle of Starcourt, which brought terror and destruction to Hawkins. Struggling with the aftermath, our group of friends are separated for the first time \u2013 and navigating the complexities of high school hasn't made things any easier. In this most vulnerable time, a new and horrifying supernatural threat surfaces, presenting a gruesome mystery that, if solved, might finally put an end to the horrors of the Upside Down.  See what Victor Creel has in store when Stranger Things Season 4 premieres on Netflix on May 27. The show has already been renewed for a fifth and final season on the platform.

Stranger Things fans officially have their first look at Victor Creel, the murderous character horror legend Robert Englund will play in the Netflix show's upcoming fourth season.  Englund makes an appearance in the newly-released official trailer for Stranger Things Season 4, with his character's eyes seemingly being scarred shut. It was first announced in November 2020 that Englund had joined the cast of the 1980s-set Stranger Things as Victor Creel, \"a disturbed and intimidating man who is imprisoned in a psychiatric hospital for a gruesome murder in the 1950s.\" RELATED: Stranger Things Debuts Season 4's Terrifying New Villain                It's only fitting that Englund would portray a murderer in a story set in the Midwestern United States during the '80s. After all, the actor is perhaps best known for playing supernatural serial killer Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise from 1984 to 2003. For years, even after his death, Freddy terrorized the residents of Springwood, Ohio. Now, Englund takes his talents to Hawkins, Indiana for the fourth season of Stranger Things.  According to Stranger Things creators Matt and Ross Duffer, Englund himself approached them about joining the show's cast. \"The fact that he came to us in a season that's so deeply inspired by the Nightmare series and by his performance especially in those movies, it felt like fate,\" Matt told IGN. \"It felt like, 'Okay, this is meant to be.'\" RELATED: Stranger Things Season 4's Episodes Are 'Double' the Length of Previous Seasons The fourth season of Stranger Things has been split into two volumes. The first volume is set to premiere on Netflix on Friday, May 27. The second volume follows suit five weeks later on Friday, July 1. An official synopsis for the season reads as follows:  It's been six months since the Battle of Starcourt, which brought terror and destruction to Hawkins. Struggling with the aftermath, our group of friends are separated for the first time \u2013 and navigating the complexities of high school hasn't made things any easier. In this most vulnerable time, a new and horrifying supernatural threat surfaces, presenting a gruesome mystery that, if solved, might finally put an end to the horrors of the Upside Down.  See what Victor Creel has in store when Stranger Things Season 4 premieres on Netflix on May 27. The show has already been renewed for a fifth and final season on the platform.

Medina, 3858 and Fernando Kern's Below Sycamore #1 introduces readers to a fascinating world of drugs, demons and desperate people.                  In 2019, writers D.A. Medina and 3858 teamed up to create a play about demonic figures walking the earth and the cyclical nature of addiction. After the success of their their theatrical debut, Medina and 3858 recruited artist Fernando Kern and designer Zueoner to help them develop the play into a comic series. Soon, Below Sycamore attracted the attention of actor Danny Trejo and rapper Mr. Criminal, whose likenesses are featured prominently throughout the series. Below Sycamore #1 is an intriguing first issue that sets the stage for an exciting, poingant series.   Bellow Sycamore #1 follows two young men, Chucho and JD as they struggle to find their way in the world. The two friends are altar boys at their local church, but JD also works for a fearsome drug dealer, known as Grumpy. He does his best to find a balance between these two elements of his life, but as his situation becomes increasingly dangerous, it looks like he will have to make a difficult decision. As JD tries to navigate his perilous path, the two young men are followed by supernatural creatures who are hellbent on protecting them.  Related: AWA's The Joneses #1 Comic Review                Medina and 3858 introduce a wide variety of characters in this first issue. While Chucho and JD steal the show, the writers introduce the audience to priests, gangsters, addicts in recovery and corrupt police. This inclusive and expansive view of the neighborhood helps make Chucho's world feel lived in while laying the foundation for an intricate plot. The otherworldly elements of Below Sycamore #1 add a sense of mystery to the proceedings and contrast with the numerous Christian themes and images to build tension. Medina and 3858 include various opposing forces -- all revolving around drugs and addiction to present an empathetic and exciting exploration of the topic.   Kern's artwork helps Medina establish a fast pace bouncing between various characters without leaving the reader behind. His character designs are naturalistic but cartoony enough to be distinctive. His subtle, almost mundane costume designs make the supernatural characters stand out and appear particularly out of place against the otherwise normal background. Kern uses this sort of contrast masterfully throughout Below Sycamore #1. JD's body language changes drastically from when he is at church to when he is on the street. Similarly, scenes of violence are fast brutal interruptions of the otherwise calm, steady pace of the story.   Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                There's nothing particularly subtle about Below Sycamore #1. The comic definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, but Medina, 3858 and Kern work together to create a really compelling first issue. Their characters feel like normal, everyday people which makes the frightening situations they find themselves in all the more emotionally intense. Readers looking for solid crime fiction with a paranormal twist or a thoughtful exploration of addiction's impact on communities will be delighted by the first issue of Below Sycamore.

Home Comics Comic Book Reviews Image Comics' Blood-Stained Teeth #1 Comic Review    Image Comics' Blood-Stained Teeth #1 Comic Review  By Dustin Holland Published 27 minutes ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Christian Ward and Patric Reynolds' Blood-Stained Teeth #1 is a beautifully drawn,  action-packed vampire story.                 Most comics fans are most likely familiar with Christian Ward as an artist. His art brought life to series like G. Willow Wilson's Invisible Kingdom and Matt Fraction's ODY-C. Readers can look forward to more of his art in the upcoming Aquaman: Andromeda, but for now, Ward is taking a moment to write a story of his own. He is joined by artist Patric Reynolds, colorist Heather Moore and letterer Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou to present Blood-Stained Teeth #1, a thrilling vampire crime comic due out April 27 from Image Comics.  Blood-Stained Teeth #1 follows an entrepreneurial vampire named Atticus Sloane. Atticus turns humans into vampires for a price. This business has afforded him a life of luxury, but it has also drawn the attention and anger of other first-born vampires, who look down on humans who become vampires. When Bram Stoker and his goon named Tooth try to bully Atticus into retiring from his grisly line of work, the vampire is forced into a dangerous situation. Related: Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review                Ward wastes no time jumping into the vicious world of vampires in Blood-Stained Teeth #1. Atticus turns a woman into a vampire on the very first page, and things only get wilder from there. Ward's fast pace helps set a punchy, exciting tone for the series. But despite the non-stop nature of this first issue, he still manages to build a complex world. The social hierarchy of first-born vampires and \"sips,\" who become vampires after being bitten, is explained briefly but clearly. Ward capitalizes on the audience's familiarity with the vampire mythos by adding his own twist to the genre without spending too much time on the exposition.  Reynolds' art captures the thrilling tone of Blood-Stained Teeth perfectly. He includes iconic horror aesthetics that fans will associate with vampires while adding his own distinct style to each character. Reynolds' style adds a modern element to the ancient characters and grounds the proceedings in contemporary times. Each page seems designed to throw the reader into a disorienting world without distracting from the narrative. Reynolds adds a brutality to each action scene and every landscape to reinforce the harsh, but entertaining tone of Ward's writing. Related: Image Comics' Radiant Red #2 Comic Review                  Heather Moore's colors add vitality and a sense of motion to every panel. She bathes Reynolds' inks in a sea of neon that helps to amplify the comic's pace. Moore makes the world of Blood-Stained Teeth bright and poppy, without distracting from the fact that it's all taking place in the middle of the night. It is sometimes difficult whether or not some of the fascinating textures in these pages originate from Moore's colors or Reynolds' drawing, but together the two have created some unforgettable images. Blood-Stained Teeth #1 lays the foundation for a thrilling crime drama. Ward and Reynolds combine horror and action to create a fun first issue that utilizes classic archetypes while being remarkably unique. The entire creative team works together to craft a truly striking first issue. Every page stands alone as a work of art, and the story is as fun as any vampire narrative in recent memory.

Most comics fans are most likely familiar with Christian Ward as an artist. His art brought life to series like G. Willow Wilson's Invisible Kingdom and Matt Fraction's ODY-C. Readers can look forward to more of his art in the upcoming Aquaman: Andromeda, but for now, Ward is taking a moment to write a story of his own. He is joined by artist Patric Reynolds, colorist Heather Moore and letterer Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou to present Blood-Stained Teeth #1, a thrilling vampire crime comic due out April 27 from Image Comics.  Blood-Stained Teeth #1 follows an entrepreneurial vampire named Atticus Sloane. Atticus turns humans into vampires for a price. This business has afforded him a life of luxury, but it has also drawn the attention and anger of other first-born vampires, who look down on humans who become vampires. When Bram Stoker and his goon named Tooth try to bully Atticus into retiring from his grisly line of work, the vampire is forced into a dangerous situation. Related: Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review                Ward wastes no time jumping into the vicious world of vampires in Blood-Stained Teeth #1. Atticus turns a woman into a vampire on the very first page, and things only get wilder from there. Ward's fast pace helps set a punchy, exciting tone for the series. But despite the non-stop nature of this first issue, he still manages to build a complex world. The social hierarchy of first-born vampires and \"sips,\" who become vampires after being bitten, is explained briefly but clearly. Ward capitalizes on the audience's familiarity with the vampire mythos by adding his own twist to the genre without spending too much time on the exposition.  Reynolds' art captures the thrilling tone of Blood-Stained Teeth perfectly. He includes iconic horror aesthetics that fans will associate with vampires while adding his own distinct style to each character. Reynolds' style adds a modern element to the ancient characters and grounds the proceedings in contemporary times. Each page seems designed to throw the reader into a disorienting world without distracting from the narrative. Reynolds adds a brutality to each action scene and every landscape to reinforce the harsh, but entertaining tone of Ward's writing.

She bathes Reynolds' inks in a sea of neon that helps to amplify the comic's pace. Moore makes the world of Blood-Stained Teeth bright and poppy, without distracting from the fact that it's all taking place in the middle of the night. It is sometimes difficult whether or not some of the fascinating textures in these pages originate from Moore's colors or Reynolds' drawing, but together the two have created some unforgettable images. Blood-Stained Teeth #1 lays the foundation for a thrilling crime drama. Ward and Reynolds combine horror and action to create a fun first issue that utilizes classic archetypes while being remarkably unique. The entire creative team works together to craft a truly striking first issue. Every page stands alone as a work of art, and the story is as fun as any vampire narrative in recent memory.

The legendary Pok\u00e9mon Arceus' majestic power and elegance have been captured in a unique new cosplay.  The innovative new take on the god-like Pok\u00e9mon comes from Twitter user @wareketsu and their unnamed cosplay partner. The two-person costume requires one person to recreate Arceus' back half by literally bending over backwards, while the front-facing cosplayer holds them up by the arms. While the costume, which is mostly made from two white body suits and some cardboard, is obviously not the most screen-accurate rendition of the character, it is a very creative \u2014 though potentially uncomfortable \u2014 way to portray the four-legged character. RELATED: Why Pok\u00e9mon Showdown Is a Vital Tool for Competitive Play          The inventive cosplayers showed off their unique costume during the entrance ceremony for Tama Art University, an art school located in Tokyo, Japan. While the entrance ceremony itself is a traditionally formal event, older members of the student body have gotten into the habit of welcoming their new classmates with imaginative or funny costumes. In a show of the school's welcoming atmosphere, @wareketu's unique costume was highlighted by the university's official Twitter account. Arceus was originally introduced in Pok\u00e9mon's fourth generation, which were remade for the Nintendo Switch in 2021 with the games Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. The mythical Pok\u00e9mon is capable of changing its type by equipping special plates and is said to be the creator of not just the Sinnoh region, but potentially the entire Pok\u00e9mon universe. The deity-like beast played a central role in the story for 2022's Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus, where it sends the player back in time from the modern era to the distant past of the Sinnoh region, where humans have only recently figured out how to catch and train Pok\u00e9mon through the use of Pok\u00e9balls.  RELATED: Scarlet & Violet Will Be the Open-World Pok\u00e9mon Game Fans Have Been Asking For Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus was lauded by critics for making some substantial changes to the series' traditional gameplay, which has seen incremental improvements since the franchise's debut on the original black-and-white Game Boy in 1996. Most notably, Legends Arceus shifted the game's structure towards a more non-linear style of gameplay with large, open regions to explore. The game also featured new changes to Pok\u00e9mon's turn-based battle systems and catching mechanics.  After spending the majority of 2021 celebrating the franchise's 25th anniversary and looking back on the series' past, Nintendo and The Pok\u00e9mon Company recently released the first look at the series' future with the first trailer for the games' ninth generation titles, Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet. The new games will expand on the gameplay revisions seen in Legends Arceus and are currently scheduled to be released exclusively for the Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

By Ederlyn Peralta Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Out of all three seasons of Psycho-Pass, season one stands out the most. Here's why!                 Production I.G. produced three exciting seasons of the cyberpunk psychological thriller Psycho-Pass. The second season provided a shock value ending, while the third season introduced an entirely new set of characters into the world of the series. However, if viewers were to compare all three seasons, the sequels clearly don't live up to the standard of the first season. Here\u2019s why the first season is the best season within the franchise.  The first season of Psycho-Pass focuses on the adventures of rookie inspector Akane Tsunemori. She and her partner Shinya Kogami are trying to stop a high-profile criminal named Shogo Makishima. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King's Censorship Hinders Progress on Important Conversations          The World of Psycho-Pass                 One aspect that viewers can praise in all seasons is the dystopia world-building within Psycho-Pass. The series is set in a futuristic Japan where the government is run by a supercomputer known as the Sibyl System. The Sibyl System is an advanced piece of technology used to serve the betterment of society by using an algorithm to determine whether or not an individual is likely to commit a crime. The assessment is known as a \u201cPsycho-Pass\u201d and includes a person\u2019s \u201cCrime Coefficient\u201d -- a numeric number that reveals a person\u2019s crime potentiality -- and a color-coded \"Hue system\" that reveals a person\u2019s mental and emotional state. Law enforcement uses a gun known as a Dominator to help scan targeted individuals that impose a threat to society.  Each season explores more aspects of the technology used in this dystopian society. In season two, viewers get more insight into the duties of an Enforcer, while in season three, fans are introduced to the criminal organization Bifrost, which uses an AI system to predict outcomes of real-world events, giving criminals a chance to commit illegal gambling. Furthermore, the Sibyl System expands beyond Japan as more countries start utilizing the system. There\u2019s also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stops international crime within this dystopian society. RELATED: What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?  The first season was written by Gen Urobuchi, the mastermind behind Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. The second and third seasons were written by Tow Ubukata under the supervision of Urobuchi. These latter two seasons added more world-building to Psycho-Pass, but it doesn\u2019t beat the originality and creativity that Urobuchi set forth, which makes the first series superior to the sequels.          Philosophical Questions Presented in Psycho-Pass                 The first season introduces some philosophical questions about freedom and justice. The Sibyl System\u2019s purpose is to protect society, but it limits a person\u2019s freedom to do what they desire. Every citizen\u2019s career and life path is predetermined by the Sibyl System so that they can maintain a happy and healthy mental state. Even if a person would like to take a different career route, they can\u2019t freely do so because it might threaten their clear-colored Hue and increase their Crime Coefficient.  Now, the Sibyl System seems to have the best interest of its citizens at heart, but the authoritarian system underhandedly forces people to voluntarily give up certain freedoms. Thus, this story invites readers to question whether or not they would be willing to give up their human rights for peace and protection. The series also highlights the importance of people's mental and emotional health. Citizens do many productive things to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, yet ironically, the series showcases that sometimes, too much of a good thing can also be a bad thing. In the show, there are certain criminal cases where healthy individuals' minds deteriorate due to traumatic events or unfair circumstances beyond their control. It is in these cases that people question the Sibyl System's control and power.  RELATED: What's the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Furthermore, the series makes viewers think about how justice is served and who determines what's right and wrong. The main protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, discovers that the Sibyl System is a supercomputer capable of making 'humane' decisions based on algorithms and logical reasoning. Tsunemori realizes the dangers of having a supercomputer governing society: it will only care about its goal of a 'perfect' society and eliminate those who don't fit its programmed standards. The Sibyl System\u2019s goal of a 'perfect' society is threatened when it discovers individuals that do not fit within its system. In season one, the main antagonist, Shogo Makishima, is a criminal mastermind whose primary goal is to destroy the Sibyl System. Makishima is a criminal, but he goes undetected by the Dominator because his crime coefficient still isn\u2019t high enough to be deemed a criminal under the Sibyl System\u2019s law.  As a result, former Inspector and current Enforcer Shinya Kogami takes matters into his own hands and becomes a vigilante to punish Makishima for killing and mutilating his colleague Mitsuru Sasayama. Kogami is a prime example of someone who believes in justice, but not under the means of the law within society. In addition, audiences gain insight into the complexity of a criminal's mind and how good and bad aren't easily defined. Kogami\u2019s actions in solving the Makishima case present some philosophical questions about justice. One of these questions involves whether it is justified for Kogami to go against the law and kill Makishima or if justice should always be served under the law. This question is further explored when Tsunemori argues that no one is above the law. Psycho-Pass argues that justice isn\u2019t always black and white -- and unlike the other two seasons, season one presents a storyline to viewers that allows them to contemplate questions such as how justice should be defined and who has the right to fairly distribute the law.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward: The Biggest Plot Twists That Defined the Anime          Akane Tsunemori, Heroine of Justice and Fairness                 Season one also introduces a strong and virtuous female protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. Usually, female protagonists in crime thrillers are dependent on their male counterparts for protection and leadership. However, Tsunemori isn't that type of person. In the first episode, \"Crime Coefficient,\" Tsunemori is assigned to handle a hostage case. While on the scene, the hostage's crime coefficient increased enough to make her a potential criminal. Kogami initially plans to execute the hostage before she can commit a crime, but instead, Tsunemori uses her Dominator to paralyze Kogami, then calms the woman down in order to lower her crime coefficient.  In this first episode, viewers can see that Tsunemori is willing to risk her own life and job to protect others, but she does so in the most intuitive yet logical method. She doesn't let her emotions interfere with her job, even when others try to manipulate her. She makes sure that every decision and action is based on what she thinks is morally justified and fair within the boundaries of the law. In fact, when Kogami's emotions interfere with his job, Tsunemori acts as his voice of reason. Although fans often romantically ship Kogami and Tsunemori, the story does not develop any sort of romance between them. If there was a romance plotline, it would undermine Tsunemori's characterization as an independent and assertive career woman who still shows empathy and understanding to those she cares about. She's definitely a role model for women interested in forensic science or criminal justice. It is a strategic move to keep Tsunemori as she, as later on in the other seasons, viewers see her willpower and strong belief in the law being put to the test.  Every Psycho-Pass season has its merits, but season one stands out thanks to its suspenseful and thrilling storyline and well-developed characters. However, what makes this season the best is the intricate world-building surrounding the Sibyl System and its philosophical questions about justice.

By Ederlyn Peralta Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Out of all three seasons of Psycho-Pass, season one stands out the most. Here's why!                 Production I.G. produced three exciting seasons of the cyberpunk psychological thriller Psycho-Pass. The second season provided a shock value ending, while the third season introduced an entirely new set of characters into the world of the series. However, if viewers were to compare all three seasons, the sequels clearly don't live up to the standard of the first season. Here\u2019s why the first season is the best season within the franchise.  The first season of Psycho-Pass focuses on the adventures of rookie inspector Akane Tsunemori. She and her partner Shinya Kogami are trying to stop a high-profile criminal named Shogo Makishima. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King's Censorship Hinders Progress on Important Conversations          The World of Psycho-Pass                 One aspect that viewers can praise in all seasons is the dystopia world-building within Psycho-Pass. The series is set in a futuristic Japan where the government is run by a supercomputer known as the Sibyl System. The Sibyl System is an advanced piece of technology used to serve the betterment of society by using an algorithm to determine whether or not an individual is likely to commit a crime. The assessment is known as a \u201cPsycho-Pass\u201d and includes a person\u2019s \u201cCrime Coefficient\u201d -- a numeric number that reveals a person\u2019s crime potentiality -- and a color-coded \"Hue system\" that reveals a person\u2019s mental and emotional state. Law enforcement uses a gun known as a Dominator to help scan targeted individuals that impose a threat to society.  Each season explores more aspects of the technology used in this dystopian society. In season two, viewers get more insight into the duties of an Enforcer, while in season three, fans are introduced to the criminal organization Bifrost, which uses an AI system to predict outcomes of real-world events, giving criminals a chance to commit illegal gambling. Furthermore, the Sibyl System expands beyond Japan as more countries start utilizing the system. There\u2019s also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stops international crime within this dystopian society. RELATED: What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?  The first season was written by Gen Urobuchi, the mastermind behind Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. The second and third seasons were written by Tow Ubukata under the supervision of Urobuchi. These latter two seasons added more world-building to Psycho-Pass, but it doesn\u2019t beat the originality and creativity that Urobuchi set forth, which makes the first series superior to the sequels.          Philosophical Questions Presented in Psycho-Pass                 The first season introduces some philosophical questions about freedom and justice. The Sibyl System\u2019s purpose is to protect society, but it limits a person\u2019s freedom to do what they desire. Every citizen\u2019s career and life path is predetermined by the Sibyl System so that they can maintain a happy and healthy mental state. Even if a person would like to take a different career route, they can\u2019t freely do so because it might threaten their clear-colored Hue and increase their Crime Coefficient.  Now, the Sibyl System seems to have the best interest of its citizens at heart, but the authoritarian system underhandedly forces people to voluntarily give up certain freedoms. Thus, this story invites readers to question whether or not they would be willing to give up their human rights for peace and protection. The series also highlights the importance of people's mental and emotional health. Citizens do many productive things to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, yet ironically, the series showcases that sometimes, too much of a good thing can also be a bad thing. In the show, there are certain criminal cases where healthy individuals' minds deteriorate due to traumatic events or unfair circumstances beyond their control. It is in these cases that people question the Sibyl System's control and power.  RELATED: What's the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Furthermore, the series makes viewers think about how justice is served and who determines what's right and wrong. The main protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, discovers that the Sibyl System is a supercomputer capable of making 'humane' decisions based on algorithms and logical reasoning. Tsunemori realizes the dangers of having a supercomputer governing society: it will only care about its goal of a 'perfect' society and eliminate those who don't fit its programmed standards. The Sibyl System\u2019s goal of a 'perfect' society is threatened when it discovers individuals that do not fit within its system. In season one, the main antagonist, Shogo Makishima, is a criminal mastermind whose primary goal is to destroy the Sibyl System. Makishima is a criminal, but he goes undetected by the Dominator because his crime coefficient still isn\u2019t high enough to be deemed a criminal under the Sibyl System\u2019s law.  As a result, former Inspector and current Enforcer Shinya Kogami takes matters into his own hands and becomes a vigilante to punish Makishima for killing and mutilating his colleague Mitsuru Sasayama. Kogami is a prime example of someone who believes in justice, but not under the means of the law within society. In addition, audiences gain insight into the complexity of a criminal's mind and how good and bad aren't easily defined. Kogami\u2019s actions in solving the Makishima case present some philosophical questions about justice. One of these questions involves whether it is justified for Kogami to go against the law and kill Makishima or if justice should always be served under the law. This question is further explored when Tsunemori argues that no one is above the law. Psycho-Pass argues that justice isn\u2019t always black and white -- and unlike the other two seasons, season one presents a storyline to viewers that allows them to contemplate questions such as how justice should be defined and who has the right to fairly distribute the law.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward: The Biggest Plot Twists That Defined the Anime          Akane Tsunemori, Heroine of Justice and Fairness                 Season one also introduces a strong and virtuous female protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. Usually, female protagonists in crime thrillers are dependent on their male counterparts for protection and leadership. However, Tsunemori isn't that type of person. In the first episode, \"Crime Coefficient,\" Tsunemori is assigned to handle a hostage case. While on the scene, the hostage's crime coefficient increased enough to make her a potential criminal. Kogami initially plans to execute the hostage before she can commit a crime, but instead, Tsunemori uses her Dominator to paralyze Kogami, then calms the woman down in order to lower her crime coefficient.  In this first episode, viewers can see that Tsunemori is willing to risk her own life and job to protect others, but she does so in the most intuitive yet logical method. She doesn't let her emotions interfere with her job, even when others try to manipulate her. She makes sure that every decision and action is based on what she thinks is morally justified and fair within the boundaries of the law. In fact, when Kogami's emotions interfere with his job, Tsunemori acts as his voice of reason. Although fans often romantically ship Kogami and Tsunemori, the story does not develop any sort of romance between them. If there was a romance plotline, it would undermine Tsunemori's characterization as an independent and assertive career woman who still shows empathy and understanding to those she cares about. She's definitely a role model for women interested in forensic science or criminal justice. It is a strategic move to keep Tsunemori as she, as later on in the other seasons, viewers see her willpower and strong belief in the law being put to the test.  Every Psycho-Pass season has its merits, but season one stands out thanks to its suspenseful and thrilling storyline and well-developed characters. However, what makes this season the best is the intricate world-building surrounding the Sibyl System and its philosophical questions about justice.

The Dawn of the Witch debuts with a new cast, some returning characters and a brand new story.                  The following contains spoilers for The Dawn of the Witch Episode 1, \"The Remedial Student and the Witch of the Staff,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The Dawn of the Witch made its debut as a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, complete with a new cast of characters and a new storyline that takes place 10 years after the events of the original series. Grimoire of Zero takes place in a world where witches and magic are scorned, more out of fear of the unknown than anything else. The original series followed a young witch named Zero who was searching for a stolen magical tome containing dangerous information about magic that could be abused in the wrong hands. She was joined by a beastfallen companion named Mercenary and another witch named Albus, and together, they fought against Zero's villainous brother Thirteen, who was supposedly burned at the stake.  In The Dawn of the Witch Episode 1, audience members are introduced to an amnesiac boy named Saybil who had his memories stolen under mysterious circumstances three years prior. He is a student at the magic school that's run by an older Albus and her old friend Holdem, who also appeared in Grimoire of Zero. As a student, Saybil is an under-performer and is expected to be expelled for his poor marks. Interestingly, despite his memory loss, he remembers the events of Grimoire of Zero, especially the war between the witches and humans and the villainous actions of Thirteen. RELATED: The Strongest Sage Fights His Deadliest Enemy With Devastating Consequences                 One day at school, Saybil is summoned to Albus' office with a proposition. Instead of expelling him from her school for his low performance, she decides to transfer him to a new town that's meant to be a safe haven for witches. In a world that persecutes them due to an unfounded fear of magic, in this new town, witches are able to live freely and without fear of having violence committed against them. Albus rationalizes that if she makes Saybil the mage protector of the town under the mentorship of a more experienced mage, she'll be able to help him develop his magic skills more effectively. If after three years she doesn't see any progress from him, she will erase his memories of magic and her school, which would effectively leave him with nothing. Saybil accepts Albus' proposition without question and is joined by one of his classmates, Hort, who is one of the magic school's top students. It is unclear what Hort expects to get out of joining Saybil in this new town, but her motivations aren't as mysterious compared to those of the 300-year-old witch Loux Krystas.  RELATED: The Strongest Sage\u2019s Final Episode Leaves a Lot to Be Desired                Apart from being known as the titular Dawn Witch, little is known about Loux Krystas' history or her relationship with Albus and Holdem. At best, it's known that her powerful staff has been in her family's lineage for generations and is her most valued possession, indicating that she is at least a well-established witch. She was also responsible for sending Saybil's actual witch escort on a different errand so that she could appoint herself as Saybil's escort. Loux never states her reasons for this action, but it's strongly implied that the town Saybil needs to get to has something she wants -- most likely Zero's grimoire from the previous series. If the latter is what she's after, this could potentially place Loux in either a villainous role or that of an antihero.  While the first episode of The Dawn of the Witch is mostly set up for the series, it does tease future appearances from other Grimoire of Zero characters, including Zero herself and possibly Mercenary. The first episode even hints at the return of Zero\u2019s brother Thirteen, who was supposed to be burned at the stake but made his magical escape.

The Dawn of the Witch debuts with a new cast, some returning characters and a brand new story.                  The following contains spoilers for The Dawn of the Witch Episode 1, \"The Remedial Student and the Witch of the Staff,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The Dawn of the Witch made its debut as a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, complete with a new cast of characters and a new storyline that takes place 10 years after the events of the original series. Grimoire of Zero takes place in a world where witches and magic are scorned, more out of fear of the unknown than anything else. The original series followed a young witch named Zero who was searching for a stolen magical tome containing dangerous information about magic that could be abused in the wrong hands. She was joined by a beastfallen companion named Mercenary and another witch named Albus, and together, they fought against Zero's villainous brother Thirteen, who was supposedly burned at the stake.  In The Dawn of the Witch Episode 1, audience members are introduced to an amnesiac boy named Saybil who had his memories stolen under mysterious circumstances three years prior. He is a student at the magic school that's run by an older Albus and her old friend Holdem, who also appeared in Grimoire of Zero. As a student, Saybil is an under-performer and is expected to be expelled for his poor marks. Interestingly, despite his memory loss, he remembers the events of Grimoire of Zero, especially the war between the witches and humans and the villainous actions of Thirteen. RELATED: The Strongest Sage Fights His Deadliest Enemy With Devastating Consequences                 One day at school, Saybil is summoned to Albus' office with a proposition. Instead of expelling him from her school for his low performance, she decides to transfer him to a new town that's meant to be a safe haven for witches. In a world that persecutes them due to an unfounded fear of magic, in this new town, witches are able to live freely and without fear of having violence committed against them. Albus rationalizes that if she makes Saybil the mage protector of the town under the mentorship of a more experienced mage, she'll be able to help him develop his magic skills more effectively. If after three years she doesn't see any progress from him, she will erase his memories of magic and her school, which would effectively leave him with nothing. Saybil accepts Albus' proposition without question and is joined by one of his classmates, Hort, who is one of the magic school's top students. It is unclear what Hort expects to get out of joining Saybil in this new town, but her motivations aren't as mysterious compared to those of the 300-year-old witch Loux Krystas.  RELATED: The Strongest Sage\u2019s Final Episode Leaves a Lot to Be Desired                Apart from being known as the titular Dawn Witch, little is known about Loux Krystas' history or her relationship with Albus and Holdem. At best, it's known that her powerful staff has been in her family's lineage for generations and is her most valued possession, indicating that she is at least a well-established witch. She was also responsible for sending Saybil's actual witch escort on a different errand so that she could appoint herself as Saybil's escort. Loux never states her reasons for this action, but it's strongly implied that the town Saybil needs to get to has something she wants -- most likely Zero's grimoire from the previous series. If the latter is what she's after, this could potentially place Loux in either a villainous role or that of an antihero.  While the first episode of The Dawn of the Witch is mostly set up for the series, it does tease future appearances from other Grimoire of Zero characters, including Zero herself and possibly Mercenary. The first episode even hints at the return of Zero\u2019s brother Thirteen, who was supposed to be burned at the stake but made his magical escape.

Detective Conan (Case Closed) creator Gosho Aoyama released new art of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's Rohan Kishibe.  The new art appears in Detective Conan's 101st collected volume and was shared online by Twitter user Weekly Shougakukan Edition. The volume, which was released in Japan on April 13, features a portrait of Rohan Kishibe, a character that was originally introduced in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's fourth part, Diamond is Unbreakable. Kishibe is said to be one of Jojo creator Hirohiko Araki's favorite characters, and it appears that Aoyama shares a similar affection for the Stand user, who is also a manga author. RELATED: Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Heroes Unite in Generation Spanning Anniversary Art      In addition to his initial appearance as an antagonist in Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Kishibe appears as the main character in his own spinoff series, Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe, which is written and drawn by Hirohiko Araki himself. The spinoff series began in 1997 and has released new chapters intermittently in the decades since, with its ninth and most recent chapter, \"Hot Summer Martha,\" being released on March 19, 2022. Aoyama states that his favorite episode from the series is \"Millionaire's Village,\" which sees Kishibe traveling with his editor to a secluded mountain village where she intends to buy some property.  Jojo's fans who want to see another different take on Kishibe can also check out the live-action adaptation of Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe, which was recently made available for streaming outside of Japan thanks to the RetroCrush streaming service. RetroCrush is now streaming the first three episodes of the show, the first of which is an adaptation of the \"Millionaire's Village\" story. The anime adaptation, which is produced by David Production, the same studio behind the main Jojo's Bizarre Adventure TV series, is available for streaming on Netflix.

A new behind-the-scenes video offers a deeper look at the two upcoming Fullmetal Alchemist movies.  The new movies, whose subtitles can be roughly translated as The Avenger Scar and The Last Transmutation, were unveiled in March and will serve as the conclusion to the story that began with the 2017 live-action Fullmetal Alchemist movie. The new video mostly focuses on the character of Scar and shows off more of the state alchemist killer as he hunts down more of his targets and battles with the two Elric brothers. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Reveals First Poster for Upcoming Live-Action Movies    Scar will be portrayed in live-action by the Japanese-American actor Mackenyu. The actor, who is the son of legendary martial artist and actor Sonny Chiba, previously starred in the live-action adaptation of Chihayafuru. Anime fans will be seeing more of him in the future, as he is also set to star in Netflix's live-action One Piece series, where he will play the role of the three-sword wielding bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro. He has also been cast as the lead in the upcoming live-action Saint Seiya movie, which is currently in production.  Mackenyu will be joined by Ryosuke Yamada and Atomu Mizuishi, who will reprise their roles as Edward and Alphonse Elric, respectively. Yamada previously starred in the live-action adaptation of Assassination Classroom. Dean Fujioka, who performed Yuri!! on Ice's theme song, \"History Maker,\" will also reprise his role as the Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang. Fumihiko Sori, who directed the original film, will also return to helm both sequels. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Reveals First Trailer for New Live-Action Movies Fullmetal Alchemist was created by Hiromi Arakawa in 2001 and remains one of the most popular manga series from that era. Arakawa's work was first adapted into an anime in 2003. This series, which was produced before the manga was completed, was a huge commercial success at the time of its release, but it is now criticized for diverging substantially from the original source material. A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, was produced in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of the manga and is now widely regarded as the stronger adaptation.  Fullmetal Alchemist: The Avenger Scar is scheduled to be released in Japan on May 20, while The Last Transmutation will premiere in the region on June 24. The first film in the live-action trilogy was released in 2017 and was distributed internationally as an exclusive for Netflix, where it is still available for streaming. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

Home TV TV Features Stranger Things Season 4's Trailer Contains a Secret Message    Stranger Things Season 4's Trailer Contains a Secret Message  By MJ Malpiedi Published 5 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The official Stranger Things Season 4 trailer is full of surprises, including a hidden message uncovered by eagle-eyed fans.                 The Stranger Things Season 4 trailer has barely been out for a day, and fans are already finding coded messages hidden amongst the flashing lights. Incredibly observant fans have even discovered that if you pause the video just right at 1:59, there appear to be time stamps embedded within the cosmic-looking clouds.  The timestamps go from left to right across the image and are 1:46, :33, 2:30 and :52 specifically. Fans aren't sure if the time stamps correlate to previously released teasers for Season 4 or if the timestamps are related to scenes from the full trailer. The issue with the previous teaser theory, however, is that a couple of the timestamps are too long to be attributed to the teaser trailers since those are much shorter. In contrast, the official trailer is long enough to contain all of these timestamps, and the scenes highlighted at each stamp could hint at major plot points for Season 4.  RELATED: Stranger Things Season 4\u2019s Tagline Echoes Another Major Sci-Fi Franchise In the full Stranger Things Season 4 trailer, the corresponding scenes based on the timestamps are Mike watching Eleven being taken away by police, Max reading a letter at Billy's grave, new character Eddie Munson leading a Dungeons & Dragons campaign and Dustin and Mike in the stands at Lucas' basketball game. Each scene is, of course, rather vague in its context since the showrunners don't want to spoil any of the plot before the first part of Season 4 releases in May. This makes it even more peculiar that these timestamps were hidden toward the end of the trailer.                  There are many possibilities when it comes to these specific scenes and what is actually happening within the plot, so obviously, fans are already speculating on the meaning behind the timestamps. The leading theory is that a multiverse of sorts is about to be introduced in Season 4 since the stamps are around large portals that are opening across this cosmos. This theory could also explain why the new trailer appears to show Max with superpowers, as she could be, to borrow the Marvel Cinematic Universe's terminology, a variant of Max from another reality. RELATED: Stranger Things' Season 4 Synopsis Confirms the Show's New Character Dynamic  There is also quite a bit of speculation that time travel will be featured in this coming season as a major aspect of the plot. The portals may be wormholes that the Hawkins gang will traverse via the Upside Down. It could be that some of these scenes are revisited by the gang later in the season as they get into some time-traveling shenanigans. Another possibility is that these particular scenes are all happening simultaneously within the timeline of Season 4's plot. It seems like the Stranger Things Season 4 trailer is just the gift that keeps on giving for eager fans of the series who want to devour every last detail. Fans will be theorizing wildly on the intent of the timestamps for the next few weeks. It will be interesting to see if anyone unravels their mystery before Season 4 debuts.  To see what mysteries the timestamps hold, Stranger Things Season 4 Vol. 1 arrives on Netflix on May 27 while Vol. 2 will be released on July 1.

The Stranger Things Season 4 trailer has barely been out for a day, and fans are already finding coded messages hidden amongst the flashing lights. Incredibly observant fans have even discovered that if you pause the video just right at 1:59, there appear to be time stamps embedded within the cosmic-looking clouds.  The timestamps go from left to right across the image and are 1:46, :33, 2:30 and :52 specifically. Fans aren't sure if the time stamps correlate to previously released teasers for Season 4 or if the timestamps are related to scenes from the full trailer. The issue with the previous teaser theory, however, is that a couple of the timestamps are too long to be attributed to the teaser trailers since those are much shorter. In contrast, the official trailer is long enough to contain all of these timestamps, and the scenes highlighted at each stamp could hint at major plot points for Season 4.  RELATED: Stranger Things Season 4\u2019s Tagline Echoes Another Major Sci-Fi Franchise In the full Stranger Things Season 4 trailer, the corresponding scenes based on the timestamps are Mike watching Eleven being taken away by police, Max reading a letter at Billy's grave, new character Eddie Munson leading a Dungeons & Dragons campaign and Dustin and Mike in the stands at Lucas' basketball game. Each scene is, of course, rather vague in its context since the showrunners don't want to spoil any of the plot before the first part of Season 4 releases in May. This makes it even more peculiar that these timestamps were hidden toward the end of the trailer.                  There are many possibilities when it comes to these specific scenes and what is actually happening within the plot, so obviously, fans are already speculating on the meaning behind the timestamps. The leading theory is that a multiverse of sorts is about to be introduced in Season 4 since the stamps are around large portals that are opening across this cosmos. This theory could also explain why the new trailer appears to show Max with superpowers, as she could be, to borrow the Marvel Cinematic Universe's terminology, a variant of Max from another reality. RELATED: Stranger Things' Season 4 Synopsis Confirms the Show's New Character Dynamic  There is also quite a bit of speculation that time travel will be featured in this coming season as a major aspect of the plot. The portals may be wormholes that the Hawkins gang will traverse via the Upside Down. It could be that some of these scenes are revisited by the gang later in the season as they get into some time-traveling shenanigans. Another possibility is that these particular scenes are all happening simultaneously within the timeline of Season 4's plot. It seems like the Stranger Things Season 4 trailer is just the gift that keeps on giving for eager fans of the series who want to devour every last detail. Fans will be theorizing wildly on the intent of the timestamps for the next few weeks. It will be interesting to see if anyone unravels their mystery before Season 4 debuts.  To see what mysteries the timestamps hold, Stranger Things Season 4 Vol. 1 arrives on Netflix on May 27 while Vol. 2 will be released on July 1.

A behind-the-scenes video from the set of Kraven the Hunter offers a new look at the upcoming Spider-Man spinoff's car chase set-piece.  The footage appears to show star Aaron Taylor-Johnson (or his stunt double) clinging to the side of a black van as it races down a busy London street. Taylor-Johnson plays Sergei Kravinoff -- better known as Kraven the Hunter -- a supernaturally-enhanced big game hunter and long-time enemy of Spider-Man. If the character in the video is indeed Kraven, the hunter's unique abilities would explain how he maintains his grip on the van, despite it moving at high speed and veering wildly across the road.

The action in this footage matched what is seen in the new video, albeit captured from different, more street-level angles. Collectively, the trio of clips appears to confirm Taylor-Johnson's earlier comments about having \"a bunch of stunt training to do for this movie.\" The footage follows a flurry of casting announcements in recent months. Russell Crowe was one of the first actors to join Kraven the Hunter's supporting cast, signing on in February. Crowe's role in the film is still yet to be disclosed, although some fans theorize he will play a member of Kraven's family.  Related: Jared Leto's Morbius Takes Flight in New Clip More recently, White Lotus star Fred Hechinger entered the fold as Chameleon. A master of disguise, Dmitri Smerdyakov/Chameleon is Kraven's half-brother and one of Spider-Man's oldest foes. Kodi Smit-McPhee, who portrayed Nightcrawler in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, was reportedly the first choice to play Chameleon. These plans were reportedly scuttled by scheduling issues between Smit-McPhee and the production, paving the way for Hechinger to claim the role. Then there's West Side Story's Ariana DeBose, who has been tapped to play voodoo priestess Calypso. Little is known about how Calypso will factor into Kraven the Hunter's plot, although in the comics, she was Kraven's on/off flame and often joined forces with him to take on Spider-Man. Without Remorse star Jodie Turner-Smith was supposedly the front runner for the role in July 2021, however, she was never officially announced as a part of Kraven the Hunter's cast.

Radiant Red #2   Writer  Cherish Chen    Artist  David Lafuente, Miquel Muerto    Letterer  Diego Sanches    Publisher  Image Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      When considering what they would do if they had superpowers, almost everyone comes up with inspiring answers. The question becomes more difficult for a middle school teacher about to be homeless because of her fianc\u00e9's gambling addiction, who suddenly receives the matter-absorbing powers of a black hole. When Satomi Sone receives her Radiant Red powers, she decides to rob banks to alleviate her financial situation. Emerging hero Radiant Black tries to stop her, but the altercation soon turns deadly. Written by Cherish Chen with artwork from David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto and lettering by Diego Sanches, Radiant Red #2 by Image Comics continues Satomi's story as she reassesses her life choices.  A spinoff of the massively popular Radiant Black series, Radiant Red #2 gets into the thick of the action right from the start. Some unscrupulous yet powerful people want to meet Satomi in an abandoned steel plant. In typical bad guy fashion, Radiant Red walks right into an ambush. She quickly disposes of soon goons, who charge at her as soon as she enters. Suddenly, the creepy man she met at school in the morning appears out of the shadows, patronizingly applauding her on her battle skills. With a blinding flash, he changes into a high-tech suit and asks Satomi to call him Shift. Radiant Red clenches her fists and readily obliges.  RELATED: Image Comics' King Spawn #8 Comic Review                 Satomi has always led an uneventful life, never expecting anyone else, even her family, to exceed the limitations of her middle-class setting. When life finds a way to throw her world into disarray, Satomi goes down a darker path to claw back any semblance of control, inadvertently attracting the attention of the wrong crowd. Radiant Red #2 brings a grounded spin on the superhero genre while introducing a host of new characters that complicate things for the matter-absorbing protagonist. Writer Cherish Chen, who helped creator Kyle Higgins flesh out Satomi's character back in Radiant Black #6, is back at the helm. Between an action-heavy start and a dialogue-heavy end, Chen strikes a fine balance, weaving a narrative laced with action, intrigue, and suspense.  The fan-favorite creative team of artists David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto return to broaden the horizons of the world of Radiant Red. The stylized artwork of the book infuses dynamic energy into the panels as Radiant Red jumps into action, punching villains left, right, and center. From graffiti-laden walls to the dirty, abandoned atmosphere, the anime-esque aesthetic of the character designs works in juxtaposition with its surroundings. Muerto uses a vivid palette of colors that gives off a bright glow throughout the panels, with Radiant Red's crimson radiance overpowering every other shade. The colorful characters in a darker background place focus on the moving elements and add vibrancy to the artwork.  RELATED: Image Comics' Ghost Cage #1 Comic Review                 Despite opening with a flurry of bombastic action, Radiant Red #2 does not contribute much in the way of progression of events as the issue concentrates on building the plot before the final launch. Satomi burrows herself deeper into criminal endeavors, a world she has just scratched the surface of using her Radiant powers but is absolutely out of depth. As the crime boss makes themselves known, they use Satomi's desperation and predicament to their advantage, manipulating Radiant Red into committing one of the greatest heists of all time. Radiant Red #2 ends on a cliffhanger that not only brings new prospects for Satomi but also for the Radiant franchise as a whole.

Radiant Red #2   Writer  Cherish Chen    Artist  David Lafuente, Miquel Muerto    Letterer  Diego Sanches    Publisher  Image Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      When considering what they would do if they had superpowers, almost everyone comes up with inspiring answers. The question becomes more difficult for a middle school teacher about to be homeless because of her fianc\u00e9's gambling addiction, who suddenly receives the matter-absorbing powers of a black hole. When Satomi Sone receives her Radiant Red powers, she decides to rob banks to alleviate her financial situation. Emerging hero Radiant Black tries to stop her, but the altercation soon turns deadly. Written by Cherish Chen with artwork from David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto and lettering by Diego Sanches, Radiant Red #2 by Image Comics continues Satomi's story as she reassesses her life choices.  A spinoff of the massively popular Radiant Black series, Radiant Red #2 gets into the thick of the action right from the start. Some unscrupulous yet powerful people want to meet Satomi in an abandoned steel plant. In typical bad guy fashion, Radiant Red walks right into an ambush. She quickly disposes of soon goons, who charge at her as soon as she enters. Suddenly, the creepy man she met at school in the morning appears out of the shadows, patronizingly applauding her on her battle skills. With a blinding flash, he changes into a high-tech suit and asks Satomi to call him Shift. Radiant Red clenches her fists and readily obliges.  RELATED: Image Comics' King Spawn #8 Comic Review                 Satomi has always led an uneventful life, never expecting anyone else, even her family, to exceed the limitations of her middle-class setting. When life finds a way to throw her world into disarray, Satomi goes down a darker path to claw back any semblance of control, inadvertently attracting the attention of the wrong crowd. Radiant Red #2 brings a grounded spin on the superhero genre while introducing a host of new characters that complicate things for the matter-absorbing protagonist. Writer Cherish Chen, who helped creator Kyle Higgins flesh out Satomi's character back in Radiant Black #6, is back at the helm. Between an action-heavy start and a dialogue-heavy end, Chen strikes a fine balance, weaving a narrative laced with action, intrigue, and suspense.  The fan-favorite creative team of artists David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto return to broaden the horizons of the world of Radiant Red. The stylized artwork of the book infuses dynamic energy into the panels as Radiant Red jumps into action, punching villains left, right, and center. From graffiti-laden walls to the dirty, abandoned atmosphere, the anime-esque aesthetic of the character designs works in juxtaposition with its surroundings. Muerto uses a vivid palette of colors that gives off a bright glow throughout the panels, with Radiant Red's crimson radiance overpowering every other shade. The colorful characters in a darker background place focus on the moving elements and add vibrancy to the artwork.  RELATED: Image Comics' Ghost Cage #1 Comic Review                 Despite opening with a flurry of bombastic action, Radiant Red #2 does not contribute much in the way of progression of events as the issue concentrates on building the plot before the final launch. Satomi burrows herself deeper into criminal endeavors, a world she has just scratched the surface of using her Radiant powers but is absolutely out of depth. As the crime boss makes themselves known, they use Satomi's desperation and predicament to their advantage, manipulating Radiant Red into committing one of the greatest heists of all time. Radiant Red #2 ends on a cliffhanger that not only brings new prospects for Satomi but also for the Radiant franchise as a whole.

The following contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 350, \"Bound To A Fiery Fate\" by Horikoshi Kohei, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media.   Even though Dabi was one of the founding members of the League of Villains, very little was known about the human flamethrower. He always deflected personal questions from his teammates, and even after he proclaimed to the world that he was actually Touya Todoroki, he never went into detail on how Endeavor's firstborn son morphed into the scarred villain - until now. During his battle with Shoto, Dabi finally revealed how he survived the blaze of his own making on Sekoto Peak.  It turns out that Dabi's flames did indeed incapacitate him on that fateful day, and he may have died had All For One not shown up to collect him. Before the villain leader had decided on Shigaraki Tomura as his next incarnation, he'd collected several potential candidates with powerful abilities that could serve as spares. With his incredibly powerful Cremation Quirk, Touya drew All For One's attention, and he was taken to a mysterious facility to heal. RELATED: Near-Forgotten MHA Theory Rises From the Ashes - and Dabi May Do the Same                 Touya's recovery process was a long and arduous one. After being operated on by the proficient Dr. Garaki, Touya finally awoke three years after the Sekoto Peak fire. He awoke in the institution All For One kept his \"adopted\" children to find himself a completely different person from who he was before the accident. The first traces of what would eventually become his trademark facial scars were visible, and the damage to his vocal cords made his voice unrecognizable to even himself.  Shortly after Touya woke up, the other children in All For One's institution and Dr. Garaki attempted to explain that he would never be able to have his old life back, but he refused to accept it. The doctor had been forced to replace his several damaged body parts with regenerative tissue, with the tradeoff being a weakened Cremation Quirk and an inability to feel pain. Ever the crafty one, All For One offered to return his flames to their full strength, a process that might have involved turning Touya into a Nomu. Luckily, Touya resented the idea of being assisted by anyone other than Endeavor so much that he burned the entire building down and made his way back home to his family.  RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army                 Neither All For One nor Dr. Garaki expected Touya to last a month after waking up, so they were happy to leave him to his own devices after he escaped. What they didn't take into account was his sheer force of will, and how deeply Touya felt about his father and his family. Touya made his way home expecting a reformed Endeavor, and a family eagerly awaiting his return but had the misfortune of arriving only to witness Shoto and their father during a particularly grueling training session and a shrine in his own honor. Realizing that his family had seemingly forgotten about him, and was just repeating the same patterns of abuse angered him, and he swore his revenge then.  After a final prayer to his memory at his own shrine, Touya shed his previous name and from then on referred to himself as Dabi. He resumed training Cremation by himself and progressed by leaps and bounds since he could no longer feel the pain of his Quirk's adverse effects on himself. Through sheer hate for his father, Dabi blew past the one-month life expectancy Dr. Garaki had predicted for him since he woke up. He made his entire life's mission to destroy all Endeavor held dear, and didn't mind hurting his body, or even dying in the process. Dabi's story and the revelation that he was suicidal must've been very sympathetic to Shoto, as not long ago he'd been living his life solely to reject Endeavor similar to Dabi. Despite that, he couldn't continue to let his older brother run lose, and he told Dabi as much. Shoto's assertion of not letting Dabi do as he pleased was in obvious reference to his villainous acts, but it might also extend to not letting Dabi perish once again within his flames. Judging by how much conviction Touya has shown towards ending himself and his brother, Shoto has got his work cut out for him.

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions. With no hope of relief in sight, how long can Crosby, Whitamore and Singh preserve their force against annihilation?

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions. With no hope of relief in sight, how long can Crosby, Whitamore and Singh preserve their force against annihilation?

Instead, he is the reincarnated soul of a powerful sorcerer whose goal in life is to build friendships.                  The following contains spoilers for The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody Episode 1, \"Typical Nobody,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody, written by My\u014djin Kat\u014d and illustrated by Sao Mizuno, was originally released as a light novel series on the user-generated novel publishing website Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d in 2017. The following year, it was acquired by Fujimi Shobo, enabling the series to receive physical releases across Japan and North America. Now, with nine volumes to its name, the series has finally had its first episode released after the anime adaption was announced at the Kadokawa Light Novel Expo 2020.  The show follows the story of the reincarnated soul of Varvatos -- a powerful sorcerer who is no longer recognized as a human being. Reborn as Ard Meteor, he seeks to live an ordinary life in an effort to reconnect with mankind and build friendships with those around him. However, this is a little more difficult than Varvatos initially suspects. Related: One-Punch Man: Garo Realizes the True Meaning of Power                Ard Meteor, formerly known as the Demon Lord Varatos, was born into a quiet town within a normal home, where he lives with his \u201ccompletely average\u201d parents. The world he occupies is filled with strange creatures and magic and is set in a fantasy medieval-style period. Since his reincarnation, magical powers and education have rapidly declined. Fortunately or unfortunately, Meteor has been blessed with magical and physical capabilities that are beyond the scope of those around him, despite them being considered average in his previous life.  On Ard\u2019s 10th birthday, his parents inform him that this is a special moment and one where he should start thinking about his dreams and future. Ard reflects on this comment and believes that his ambition in life, after 10 years of maturing intellectually and physically, is to establish friendships and \u201cfind a person who does not look at [him] with fear.\u201d Related: Why Summer Time Rendering Is the Mystery-Horror Anime to Watch This Spring                The majority of Episode 1, \u201cTypical Nobody,\u201d focuses on Meteor\u2019s attempts to become friendly with the local children of the area to fulfill his goal. However, his complete lack of social skills makes this rather difficult. Ard attempts a variety of different social strategies, from waiting for people to come to him to being rather direct with those he converses with. Each of these encounters leads to a series of failures where Ard comes off as either creepy or downright embarrassing.  Ard manages to receive advice from the town's local mayor, Sir Olhyde, that he should simply be \u201ckind and respectful\u201d to all of those he meets. However, he unfortunately takes this instruction to the extreme and ends up being even weirder than he was before. Eventually, Ard encounters Ireena Olhyde, Sir Olhyde's daughter, to whom he immediately takes a liking due to her use of magic, loneliness and the family connection they share, as her father is good friends with his parents. Now, with his sights set on Ireena, Ard takes to using everything he has learned to make his dream of having a friend become a reality.  RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army Ultimately, viewers will likely become a little tired of this show if it's simply a tale of a young boy trying to make friends. Thankfully, it appears that there is more beneath the surface of this series through its fantasy world and character building. While the first episode starts off slowly, it soon builds to a climatic end, in which viewers witness their first battle against a group of goblins and are even privy to a significant time jump that will almost certainly be expanded upon in the following episode.  While it is too early to speculate what this series has in store or the quality that can be expected from it, it's certainly worth exploring for anyone who's a fan of the fantasy genre. Whether Ard Meteor\u2019s quest to fit in with humanity is fulfilled remains to be seen. However, it looks like there will be a lot of fun and interesting experiences to be had in following this journey. Hopefully, as the series progresses, more of the world will be explored and its magical components and characters will be developed further.                  Avatar: Who Did Zuko End Up With?

Instead, he is the reincarnated soul of a powerful sorcerer whose goal in life is to build friendships.                  The following contains spoilers for The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody Episode 1, \"Typical Nobody,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody, written by My\u014djin Kat\u014d and illustrated by Sao Mizuno, was originally released as a light novel series on the user-generated novel publishing website Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d in 2017. The following year, it was acquired by Fujimi Shobo, enabling the series to receive physical releases across Japan and North America. Now, with nine volumes to its name, the series has finally had its first episode released after the anime adaption was announced at the Kadokawa Light Novel Expo 2020.  The show follows the story of the reincarnated soul of Varvatos -- a powerful sorcerer who is no longer recognized as a human being. Reborn as Ard Meteor, he seeks to live an ordinary life in an effort to reconnect with mankind and build friendships with those around him. However, this is a little more difficult than Varvatos initially suspects. Related: One-Punch Man: Garo Realizes the True Meaning of Power                Ard Meteor, formerly known as the Demon Lord Varatos, was born into a quiet town within a normal home, where he lives with his \u201ccompletely average\u201d parents. The world he occupies is filled with strange creatures and magic and is set in a fantasy medieval-style period. Since his reincarnation, magical powers and education have rapidly declined. Fortunately or unfortunately, Meteor has been blessed with magical and physical capabilities that are beyond the scope of those around him, despite them being considered average in his previous life.  On Ard\u2019s 10th birthday, his parents inform him that this is a special moment and one where he should start thinking about his dreams and future. Ard reflects on this comment and believes that his ambition in life, after 10 years of maturing intellectually and physically, is to establish friendships and \u201cfind a person who does not look at [him] with fear.\u201d Related: Why Summer Time Rendering Is the Mystery-Horror Anime to Watch This Spring                The majority of Episode 1, \u201cTypical Nobody,\u201d focuses on Meteor\u2019s attempts to become friendly with the local children of the area to fulfill his goal. However, his complete lack of social skills makes this rather difficult. Ard attempts a variety of different social strategies, from waiting for people to come to him to being rather direct with those he converses with. Each of these encounters leads to a series of failures where Ard comes off as either creepy or downright embarrassing.  Ard manages to receive advice from the town's local mayor, Sir Olhyde, that he should simply be \u201ckind and respectful\u201d to all of those he meets. However, he unfortunately takes this instruction to the extreme and ends up being even weirder than he was before. Eventually, Ard encounters Ireena Olhyde, Sir Olhyde's daughter, to whom he immediately takes a liking due to her use of magic, loneliness and the family connection they share, as her father is good friends with his parents. Now, with his sights set on Ireena, Ard takes to using everything he has learned to make his dream of having a friend become a reality.  RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army Ultimately, viewers will likely become a little tired of this show if it's simply a tale of a young boy trying to make friends. Thankfully, it appears that there is more beneath the surface of this series through its fantasy world and character building. While the first episode starts off slowly, it soon builds to a climatic end, in which viewers witness their first battle against a group of goblins and are even privy to a significant time jump that will almost certainly be expanded upon in the following episode.  While it is too early to speculate what this series has in store or the quality that can be expected from it, it's certainly worth exploring for anyone who's a fan of the fantasy genre. Whether Ard Meteor\u2019s quest to fit in with humanity is fulfilled remains to be seen. However, it looks like there will be a lot of fun and interesting experiences to be had in following this journey. Hopefully, as the series progresses, more of the world will be explored and its magical components and characters will be developed further.                  Avatar: Who Did Zuko End Up With?

Home Anime Dance Dance Danseur Is a Formulaic But Still Important Tear-Down of Toxic Masculinity    Dance Dance Danseur Is a Formulaic But Still Important Tear-Down of Toxic Masculinity  By Lara Adams Published 18 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Dance Dance Danseur is a standard tear-down of gender bias, but it has the potential to go deep.                   The following contains spoilers for Dance Dance Danseur Episode 1, \"There's No Way I'm Doing That Ballet Thing!,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.    Five years after Yuri!!! on Ice placed MAPPA on the sports anime scene, the studio is back at it with this spring season's sports drama Dance Dance Danseur, taking things off the ice and placing ballet under the spotlight. Once again, the studio is commendable for not just focusing on the sport itself but also the culture surrounding it, both positive and negative.  However, while Yuri!!! on Ice was a show focused on individual struggles with depression, isolation and abandonment, Dance Dance Danseur looks at how society influences the individual, and in this particular case, how it enforces gender roles and how these come into play in the world of ballet. Dance Dance Danseur has thus far proved predictable in the way it handles the struggle to present as hypermasculine in a society where men pursuing 'feminine' hobbies are ridiculed for their choices -- but even if it's a story that's been told before, it's still one worth repeating. Related: Yuri!! On Ice Releases New Art for Series' 5th Anniversary                 Hypermasculinity and toxic masculinity are topics addressed in many genres of anime, often appearing in unexpected ways. For example, although the men of Dragon Ball are peak masculine when it comes to athletic performance, they are often devoted husbands and fathers who view that role as their most important, and young shonen protagonists such as Kamado Tanjiro from Demon Slayer challenge those who treat others with toxicity and often extend a chance at negotiating with an enemy before fighting. These male characters embody kindness and empathy where one would expect thoughtless violence. When it comes to Dance Dance Danseur, Marao Jumpei is introduced to ballet at a young age and is enthusiastic about pursuing it. His father questions that decision but backs down when he sees how happy ballet makes his son.  When Jumpei's father dies, Jumpei's uncle tells him that he is now \"the man of the house,\" which shifts Jumpei's trajectory down a more traditionally masculine path -- one where he focuses on martial arts and leaves ballet behind. When given the chance to start ballet once more, he is faced with expectations that convince him that ballet is not manly enough and that he mustn't pursue his passion. He has a hypermasculine appearance to keep up with at school and participates in both soccer and martial arts. Still, he can't keep himself from visiting the new ballet studio that gives him the practice space he's always needed, and it becomes clear in Episode 1 that Jumpei's desire to do ballet won't collide with his own personal bias, but rather with those who will ridicule him for his decision, such as his classmates and even possibly his family members. Jumpei's decision to pursue ballet is not really a surprise, and many pieces of the story to come are predictable.  Related: Requiem of the Rose King Breaks Gender Norms - But at What Cost? Jumpei will have to ultimately reveal the fact he does ballet and will already have to choose between soccer and ballet as soon as Episode 2, bringing the issue of his masculine image to the high school setting very early in the narrative. Any public performance puts his masculine image at risk as well, and there's also the issue of a rivalry with a fellow male dancer that will undoubtedly rear its head eventually.                 This rivalry has the potential to make Jumpei's struggle with masculinity a little more interesting, with both intending to become an 'alpha male' in a space that society has deemed feminine. Pressure from both inside and outside the world of ballet about how to act appropriately masculine has the chance to truly examine the stress put on teenage boys to conform to traditional views of manliness, and the presence of Godai Miyako, the female lead, could lead to an interesting study of how that view of the alpha male damages women in society as well, especially if she ends up caught in the middle.  While hardly the most nuanced introduction to a study on gender roles, Dance Dance Danseur still has the potential to be an interesting take on the individual versus society when it comes to hypermasculinity and how men -- and young boys in particular -- are influenced by words whose impact might not even be considered. For boys, realizing that being men of the house and pursuing their interests aren't mutually exclusive could have real-world consequences on reducing toxic masculinity, and if media such as Dance Dance Danseur can be a piece of this, that makes it valuable, no matter how many times the same story is repeated.

The following contains spoilers for Dance Dance Danseur Episode 1, \"There's No Way I'm Doing That Ballet Thing!,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.    Five years after Yuri!!! on Ice placed MAPPA on the sports anime scene, the studio is back at it with this spring season's sports drama Dance Dance Danseur, taking things off the ice and placing ballet under the spotlight. Once again, the studio is commendable for not just focusing on the sport itself but also the culture surrounding it, both positive and negative.  However, while Yuri!!! on Ice was a show focused on individual struggles with depression, isolation and abandonment, Dance Dance Danseur looks at how society influences the individual, and in this particular case, how it enforces gender roles and how these come into play in the world of ballet. Dance Dance Danseur has thus far proved predictable in the way it handles the struggle to present as hypermasculine in a society where men pursuing 'feminine' hobbies are ridiculed for their choices -- but even if it's a story that's been told before, it's still one worth repeating. Related: Yuri!! On Ice Releases New Art for Series' 5th Anniversary                 Hypermasculinity and toxic masculinity are topics addressed in many genres of anime, often appearing in unexpected ways. For example, although the men of Dragon Ball are peak masculine when it comes to athletic performance, they are often devoted husbands and fathers who view that role as their most important, and young shonen protagonists such as Kamado Tanjiro from Demon Slayer challenge those who treat others with toxicity and often extend a chance at negotiating with an enemy before fighting. These male characters embody kindness and empathy where one would expect thoughtless violence. When it comes to Dance Dance Danseur, Marao Jumpei is introduced to ballet at a young age and is enthusiastic about pursuing it. His father questions that decision but backs down when he sees how happy ballet makes his son.  When Jumpei's father dies, Jumpei's uncle tells him that he is now \"the man of the house,\" which shifts Jumpei's trajectory down a more traditionally masculine path -- one where he focuses on martial arts and leaves ballet behind. When given the chance to start ballet once more, he is faced with expectations that convince him that ballet is not manly enough and that he mustn't pursue his passion. He has a hypermasculine appearance to keep up with at school and participates in both soccer and martial arts. Still, he can't keep himself from visiting the new ballet studio that gives him the practice space he's always needed, and it becomes clear in Episode 1 that Jumpei's desire to do ballet won't collide with his own personal bias, but rather with those who will ridicule him for his decision, such as his classmates and even possibly his family members. Jumpei's decision to pursue ballet is not really a surprise, and many pieces of the story to come are predictable.  Related: Requiem of the Rose King Breaks Gender Norms - But at What Cost? Jumpei will have to ultimately reveal the fact he does ballet and will already have to choose between soccer and ballet as soon as Episode 2, bringing the issue of his masculine image to the high school setting very early in the narrative. Any public performance puts his masculine image at risk as well, and there's also the issue of a rivalry with a fellow male dancer that will undoubtedly rear its head eventually.                 This rivalry has the potential to make Jumpei's struggle with masculinity a little more interesting, with both intending to become an 'alpha male' in a space that society has deemed feminine. Pressure from both inside and outside the world of ballet about how to act appropriately masculine has the chance to truly examine the stress put on teenage boys to conform to traditional views of manliness, and the presence of Godai Miyako, the female lead, could lead to an interesting study of how that view of the alpha male damages women in society as well, especially if she ends up caught in the middle.  While hardly the most nuanced introduction to a study on gender roles, Dance Dance Danseur still has the potential to be an interesting take on the individual versus society when it comes to hypermasculinity and how men -- and young boys in particular -- are influenced by words whose impact might not even be considered. For boys, realizing that being men of the house and pursuing their interests aren't mutually exclusive could have real-world consequences on reducing toxic masculinity, and if media such as Dance Dance Danseur can be a piece of this, that makes it valuable, no matter how many times the same story is repeated.

Netflix released the first official trailer for Stranger Things Season 4.  Season 4's trailer opens six months after the events of Season 3, with the kids separated for the first time. As the Byers family tries to adjust to their new life after relocating to California, the rest of the Hawkins kids deal with the aftermath of the Battle of Starcourt in their hometown. The trailer also teases a terrifying new supernatural threat that will lead the kids further into the Upside Down and directly into \"the eye of the storm.\" RELATED: Stranger Things Season 4's Episodes Are 'Double' the Length of Previous Seasons    As Stranger Things expands into its fourth season, series creators Matt and Ross Duffer compared the upcoming installment to HBO's Game of Thrones in terms of scope. \"Joyce and the Byers family have left at the end of Season 3,\" Matt Duffer said in a previous interview. \"They are in California \u2013 we've always wanted to have that like E.T.-esque suburb aesthetic, which we finally got to do this year in the desert; and then we have Hopper in Russia; and then of course we have a group remaining in Hawkins. So we have these three storylines, are all connected and kind of interwoven together, but it\u2019s just very different tones.\"  Stranger Things 4 is expected to be longer than previous seasons and will be split into two parts, Volume 1 and Volume 2. Since the third season was released in 2019, the Duffer brothers explained that the cast members growing older allowed the series to lean further into its horror elements. RELATED: Why Noah Schnapp Was in Tears After Learning Stranger Things Was Ending \"When we pitched it to Netflix all those years ago, we pitched it as the kids are... The Goonies in E.T.,\" said Ross Duffer. \"That's their storyline. And the adults are in Jaws and Close Encounters and then the teens are in Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween. But this year, we don't have the kids. We can't do The Goonies anymore. And so, suddenly, we're leaning much harder into that horror movie territory that we love. It was fun to make that change.\"  Read the synopsis for Stranger Things Season 4 below:  It's been six months since the Battle of Starcourt, which brought terror and destruction to Hawkins. Struggling with the aftermath, our group of friends are separated for the first time \u2013 and navigating the complexities of high school hasn't made things any easier. In this most vulnerable time, a new and horrifying supernatural threat surfaces, presenting a gruesome mystery that, if solved, might finally put an end to the horrors of the Upside Down.  \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSeason 4 of Stranger Things premieres on Netflix on May 27.

Home Movies Movie Features The Worst (& Most Awkward) Lines in the Star Wars Prequels    The Worst (& Most Awkward) Lines in the Star Wars Prequels  By Andrew Gold Published 2 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The Star Wars prequels are full of awkward dialogue. Here are some of the worst lines in the trilogy.                 The Star Wars prequels are notorious for their sloppy writing and awkward dialogue. It's a shame because the trilogy tells the tragic backstory of Anakin Skywalker, a heroic young Jedi who slowly gives in to the temptations of the dark side, eventually becoming Darth Vader. Unfortunately, the execution of this concept leaves a lot to be desired.  The films still have a devoted following, especially Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. And they certainly have their redeeming qualities, but they're better known for being the source of some of the Internet's most famous memes, thanks to George Lucas' ham-fisted writing. From the agonizing comedic attempts by Jar Jar Binks to the painfully uncomfortable romance between Anakin and Padm\u00e9, let\u2019s break down the absolute worst and most awkward lines in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. RELATED: Obi-Wan Failed to Teach Anakin the Perils of Attachment          Everything Jar Jar Binks Says Is an Insult to the Audience                 Perhaps the most derided character in Star Wars lore, Jar Jar Binks' reputation is well-earned. Every line uttered by Jar Jar is deliberately juvenile, made worse by the fact that he tags along the entirety of The Phantom Menace for no reason at all. His air-time is significantly reduced in the following two films due to the immense audience backlash upon the film's release. It's impossible to choose a single Jar Jar quote as the definitive worst. To narrow it down, there's a moment in The Phantom Menace when a distressed Padm\u00e9 is looking contemplatively out a window, and Jar Jar asks, \"Yousa thinking yousa people gonna die?\" And in Attack of the Clones, when he's a Representative of Naboo, he addresses his political colleagues as \"dellow felagates.\"          Anakin Skywalker Awkwardly Expresses His Distaste for Sand                 As Anakin and Padm\u00e9 are hiding out on Naboo, Padm\u00e9 recalls a time when she'd swim to a nearby island after school and lie on the beach. This prompts Anakin to say, \"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.\" It's an infamous line and rightfully so, but the fact that it leads to Anakin and Padm\u00e9's first kiss makes it doubly awkward. RELATED: Star Wars: What Happened to Coruscant After the Fall of the Republic?          Anakin Struggles With His Forbidden Love for Padm\u00e9                 A large chunk of Attack of the Clones deals with the budding romance between Anakin and Padm\u00e9. For no discernable reason, however, they are forbidden to love because Anakin is a Jedi and Padm\u00e9 is a senator. This leads to Anakin spouting Twilight-level angsty tween dialogue, the worst of which being, \"Believe me, I wish I could just wish away my feelings.\"          Anakin's Rant About Slaughtering Tusken Raiders Falls Flat                 Anakin's first major turn to the dark side is in Attack of the Clones when he massacres a village of Tusken Raiders, whom he blames for the death of his mother. After the deed, Anakin returns to the Lars homestead and confesses to Padm\u00e9: \"I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too! They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them!\"  This could've been a powerful demonstration of Anakin giving in to his impulses despite his Jedi training. The problem is, in addition to the dialogue being clunky, Anakin's turn to the dark side wasn't earned at this point, so his rant about killing Tuskens comes across as more whiny than remorseful. Also, it's disturbing how Padm\u00e9 isn't fazed at all by this news. RELATED: How the Vietnam War Inspired George Lucas\u2019 Star Wars Vision          Qui-Gon Jinn Explains to Anakin the Concept of Midi-chlorians                 One of the most heinous aspects of The Phantom Menace is the introduction of midi-chlorians. Young Anakin asks Qui-Gon what they are, and Qui-Gon explains, \"Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.\" Not only is it dry exposition, but it's exposition that ruins previously established Star Wars lore. Instead of the Force being a mystical power that can be controlled by those with enough faith, the Force is actually predetermined based on how many midi-chlorians are in one's bloodstream. It's now official Star Wars canon that Anakin Skywalker has over 20,000 midi-chlorians -- even more than Yoda.          Young Anakin Tries Out Catchphrases While Destroying the Droid Control Ship                 At the end of The Phantom Menace, Qui-Gon orders Anakin to stay in a safe place. Naturally, Anakin jumps into the nearest starfighter and powers it up, triggering its autopilot to fly him into the space battle. While accidentally destroying the Droid Control Ship, Anakin says stupid lines like, \"I'll try spinning. That's a good trick,\" and, \"Now, this is podracing!\" It's bad enough that an obnoxious child saves the day by accident, but more importantly, the scenes with Anakin in space distract from the exciting lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon and Darth Maul.  RELATED: Yoda vs. Darth Sidious Is Still Star Wars' Most Disappointing Duel          The Confrontation Between Obi-Wan and Anakin Is Filled With Clumsy Dialogue                 Revenge of the Sith culminates with the moment the prequels have been building up to: the clash between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Unfortunately, the writing during these scenes is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Obi-Wan declares that Chancellor Palpatine is evil, so Anakin replies, \"From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!\" The first rule of screenwriting is to show, not tell. But this is Anakin stating exactly how his character feels when his actions already made it abundantly clear.          Anakin Skywalker States the Obvious When Arguing With Obi-Wan                 Before their climactic battle, Anakin declares to Obi-Wan, \"If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.\" Again, subtlety isn't George Lucas' strong suit, and this line in particular sounds like it was written by an edgy fifth grader. Credit where credit is due, though, as Hayden Christensen manages to say it with a straight face. It's just a shame he didn't have better material to work with. RELATED: Star Wars: How Did the Empire Find the Rebellion in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?          Obi-Wan Proves He's a Hypocrite While Facing off Against Anakin                 Immediately after the previous line is another one of the most baffling lines in the entire trilogy: Obi-Wan says, \"Only a Sith deals in absolutes.\" It's confounding because the line itself is an absolute. And it's especially hypocritical since the Jedi deal in absolutes all the time. Yoda says, \"Do or do not. There is no try,\" in The Empire Strikes Back. Was Yoda a secret Sith all along?          Anakin and Padm\u00e9's Romantic Banter Is the Cringiest Moment of All                 Revenge of the Sith stands head and shoulders above the other two prequels thanks to its renewed focus on creative action set pieces over mundane romantic dialogue. However, early in the film, the audience is treated to a painful scene where Padm\u00e9 is standing on the balcony and Anakin says, \"You are so... beautiful.\" Padm\u00e9 replies, \"It's only because I'm so in love,\" and Anakin proclaims, \"No. No, it's because I'm so in love with you.\" Padm\u00e9 jokes, \"Then love has blinded you?\" Even Nicholas Sparks would've said this dialogue is going too far.

Here are some of the worst lines in the trilogy.                 The Star Wars prequels are notorious for their sloppy writing and awkward dialogue. It's a shame because the trilogy tells the tragic backstory of Anakin Skywalker, a heroic young Jedi who slowly gives in to the temptations of the dark side, eventually becoming Darth Vader. Unfortunately, the execution of this concept leaves a lot to be desired.  The films still have a devoted following, especially Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. And they certainly have their redeeming qualities, but they're better known for being the source of some of the Internet's most famous memes, thanks to George Lucas' ham-fisted writing. From the agonizing comedic attempts by Jar Jar Binks to the painfully uncomfortable romance between Anakin and Padm\u00e9, let\u2019s break down the absolute worst and most awkward lines in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. RELATED: Obi-Wan Failed to Teach Anakin the Perils of Attachment          Everything Jar Jar Binks Says Is an Insult to the Audience                 Perhaps the most derided character in Star Wars lore, Jar Jar Binks' reputation is well-earned. Every line uttered by Jar Jar is deliberately juvenile, made worse by the fact that he tags along the entirety of The Phantom Menace for no reason at all. His air-time is significantly reduced in the following two films due to the immense audience backlash upon the film's release. It's impossible to choose a single Jar Jar quote as the definitive worst. To narrow it down, there's a moment in The Phantom Menace when a distressed Padm\u00e9 is looking contemplatively out a window, and Jar Jar asks, \"Yousa thinking yousa people gonna die?\" And in Attack of the Clones, when he's a Representative of Naboo, he addresses his political colleagues as \"dellow felagates.\"          Anakin Skywalker Awkwardly Expresses His Distaste for Sand                 As Anakin and Padm\u00e9 are hiding out on Naboo, Padm\u00e9 recalls a time when she'd swim to a nearby island after school and lie on the beach. This prompts Anakin to say, \"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.\" It's an infamous line and rightfully so, but the fact that it leads to Anakin and Padm\u00e9's first kiss makes it doubly awkward. RELATED: Star Wars: What Happened to Coruscant After the Fall of the Republic?          Anakin Struggles With His Forbidden Love for Padm\u00e9                 A large chunk of Attack of the Clones deals with the budding romance between Anakin and Padm\u00e9. For no discernable reason, however, they are forbidden to love because Anakin is a Jedi and Padm\u00e9 is a senator. This leads to Anakin spouting Twilight-level angsty tween dialogue, the worst of which being, \"Believe me, I wish I could just wish away my feelings.\"          Anakin's Rant About Slaughtering Tusken Raiders Falls Flat                 Anakin's first major turn to the dark side is in Attack of the Clones when he massacres a village of Tusken Raiders, whom he blames for the death of his mother. After the deed, Anakin returns to the Lars homestead and confesses to Padm\u00e9: \"I killed them. I killed them all. They're dead. Every single one of them. And not just the men, but the women and the children, too! They're like animals, and I slaughtered them like animals! I hate them!\"  This could've been a powerful demonstration of Anakin giving in to his impulses despite his Jedi training. The problem is, in addition to the dialogue being clunky, Anakin's turn to the dark side wasn't earned at this point, so his rant about killing Tuskens comes across as more whiny than remorseful. Also, it's disturbing how Padm\u00e9 isn't fazed at all by this news. RELATED: How the Vietnam War Inspired George Lucas\u2019 Star Wars Vision          Qui-Gon Jinn Explains to Anakin the Concept of Midi-chlorians                 One of the most heinous aspects of The Phantom Menace is the introduction of midi-chlorians. Young Anakin asks Qui-Gon what they are, and Qui-Gon explains, \"Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life form that resides within all living cells.\" Not only is it dry exposition, but it's exposition that ruins previously established Star Wars lore. Instead of the Force being a mystical power that can be controlled by those with enough faith, the Force is actually predetermined based on how many midi-chlorians are in one's bloodstream. It's now official Star Wars canon that Anakin Skywalker has over 20,000 midi-chlorians -- even more than Yoda.          Young Anakin Tries Out Catchphrases While Destroying the Droid Control Ship                 At the end of The Phantom Menace, Qui-Gon orders Anakin to stay in a safe place. Naturally, Anakin jumps into the nearest starfighter and powers it up, triggering its autopilot to fly him into the space battle. While accidentally destroying the Droid Control Ship, Anakin says stupid lines like, \"I'll try spinning. That's a good trick,\" and, \"Now, this is podracing!\" It's bad enough that an obnoxious child saves the day by accident, but more importantly, the scenes with Anakin in space distract from the exciting lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon and Darth Maul.  RELATED: Yoda vs. Darth Sidious Is Still Star Wars' Most Disappointing Duel          The Confrontation Between Obi-Wan and Anakin Is Filled With Clumsy Dialogue                 Revenge of the Sith culminates with the moment the prequels have been building up to: the clash between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. Unfortunately, the writing during these scenes is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Obi-Wan declares that Chancellor Palpatine is evil, so Anakin replies, \"From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!\" The first rule of screenwriting is to show, not tell. But this is Anakin stating exactly how his character feels when his actions already made it abundantly clear.          Anakin Skywalker States the Obvious When Arguing With Obi-Wan                 Before their climactic battle, Anakin declares to Obi-Wan, \"If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.\" Again, subtlety isn't George Lucas' strong suit, and this line in particular sounds like it was written by an edgy fifth grader. Credit where credit is due, though, as Hayden Christensen manages to say it with a straight face. It's just a shame he didn't have better material to work with. RELATED: Star Wars: How Did the Empire Find the Rebellion in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back?          Obi-Wan Proves He's a Hypocrite While Facing off Against Anakin                 Immediately after the previous line is another one of the most baffling lines in the entire trilogy: Obi-Wan says, \"Only a Sith deals in absolutes.\" It's confounding because the line itself is an absolute. And it's especially hypocritical since the Jedi deal in absolutes all the time. Yoda says, \"Do or do not. There is no try,\" in The Empire Strikes Back. Was Yoda a secret Sith all along?          Anakin and Padm\u00e9's Romantic Banter Is the Cringiest Moment of All                 Revenge of the Sith stands head and shoulders above the other two prequels thanks to its renewed focus on creative action set pieces over mundane romantic dialogue. However, early in the film, the audience is treated to a painful scene where Padm\u00e9 is standing on the balcony and Anakin says, \"You are so... beautiful.\" Padm\u00e9 replies, \"It's only because I'm so in love,\" and Anakin proclaims, \"No. No, it's because I'm so in love with you.\" Padm\u00e9 jokes, \"Then love has blinded you?\" Even Nicholas Sparks would've said this dialogue is going too far.

Although it came out years ago, Future Diary is still considered one of the best and most fun battle royale-themed anime and manga franchises. Centered around a race to godhood, the series has taken quite a few forms and had just as many spinoffs. This has allowed it to retain its popularity even over ten years after the original manga ended, with streaming no doubt helping the anime.  Future Diary features several important characters, all of whom have their own backstories and reasons for fighting for the rank of deity. Many of the franchise's forms have been brought over to the West, while others are sadly much harder to come by. Here's what readers and viewers eager for a new battle royale-style series should know about Future Diary. RELATED: DanMachi: How to Get Started With the Anime, Manga & Light Novels           The Plot of Future Diary                 The main character of Future Diary is Yukiteru Amano, a rather socially distant teenager who keeps to himself and records what he sees from others on his phone. One of his only true friends is none other than Deus Ex Machina, the god that controls time and space. Deux Ex Machina transforms Amano's phone into a \"Future Diary\" that allows him to see into the future for up to 90 days. Unfortunately, he's not the only one with such a newfound power.  There are 11 other people who also have Future Diaries, and they must now all compete to see who will replace Deux Ex Machina as the god of Time and Space. Protecting Amano is the yandere stalker Yuno Gasai, who will do anything to keep him out of harm's way. Other competitors in this new battle royale include a terrorist who hates God, as well as an ordinary cop who wishes to end Deux Ex Machina's game. Given that it involves a battle for godhood, several similarities could be drawn between Future Diary and the more recent hit series Platinum End, with the protagonist of the latter even having the last name Mirai (literally \"Future\").  RELATED: Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Where to Read the Future Diary Manga                 Future Diary was created by Sakae Esuno and serialized in the magazine Shonen Ace from 2006 to 2010. This amounted to 12 collected volumes, although sadly, not all of these have been brought over to the West. Tokyopop initially handled the series in the West but only localized 10 of the 12 volumes, with the last of these releasing in 2011. Viz Media handled the series after Tokyopop ceased traditional publications, although it only released the series digitally. This is the best way to read the manga, as even physical retailers such as Barnes & Noble no longer carry the physical versions of Future Diary. Instead, those interested in reading the series should consider purchasing these volumes through Kindle & Comixology. Spinoffs such as Future Diary: Mosaic have also not been localized outside of Japan.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Bakuman          Where to Watch the Future Diary Anime                 Asread was the studio behind the anime version of Future Diary, which ran for 26 episodes from 2011 to 2012. The series was localized by Funimation, although it's also available to stream through both Funimation's now sister service Crunchyroll and Hulu. The OVA Future Diary: Redial served as an epilogue to the story, with a manga of the same name doing so for the original book. 2012 also saw the release of Future Diary: Another:World, a 12-episode live-action adaptation that remixed the premise with entirely new characters. However, this isn't currently available on any Western streaming service and has been kept in Japan.  Walmart, Target, Amazon and Right Stuf Anime all carry the Blu-ray collection of the Future Diary anime. This contains not only the entirety of the show but also the OVA epilogue Redial. For those without any of the aforementioned streaming services, this is probably the easiest way to watch the series.

By Paige Villacin Published 5 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Despite being such a popular genre, why do so few magical girl anime break into the mainstream of the western market?                  The Magical Girl genre has long since become one of many staples associated with anime -- so much so that it's frequently parodied not just by other anime, but by western cartoons as well. Despite this, very few magical girl series have actually broken through the mainstream. It certainly isn\u2019t because the industry has been producing less magical girl anime, but rather, western publishers seem to be averse to localizing most of them.  This is a problem that\u2019s perpetuated not just in anime, but the animation industry as a whole for many years. Shows with a male demographic will almost always receive preference over those targeted at girls. The few that are made with a female demographic in mind tend to go out of their way to appeal to a male audience as well, such as changing the title to give less focus on the female protagonist (ie: changing Miraculous Ladybug to The Adventures of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir) or elevating a male character to a secondary protagonist position. RELATED: From Arina Tanemura to Clamp: Influential Shojo Artists of the Early 2000s                  One of the best-known anime that takes the above practice to heart is Cardcaptor Sakura. When it was first released in English in the west, its title was changed to Cardcaptors. This rename accomplished two things: it put less focus on the female protagonist, and it gave more importance to a male character. In the original series, Sakura is the only character to ever receive the title of \u201cCardcaptor\u201d. In Nelvana\u2019s English dub, it isn\u2019t just Sakura who receives this title, but Syaoran (renamed Lee in the dub) as well. Lee is also elevated from supporting character to co-protagonist status, again to appeal to the male demographic. His romance with Sakura is completely scrapped, and any episodes that focused on the series' more slice-of-life aspects were completely removed in favor of more action-based storylines. In short, Nelvana repackaged this classic shoujo anime into a shounen series with a female lead.  Every few years, popular children\u2019s anime geared toward boys will receive a new iteration featuring an entirely new cast. Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade are some of the more popular ones that come to mind. Many of these have made their way to broadcast networks in the west -- in fact, the latest iteration of Beyblade is currently airing on Disney XD. The same treatment has been given to many popular children\u2019s anime aimed at girls as well, ranging from magical girl anime to idol anime. However, most of these long-running franchises have never made their way to western television sets.  RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover                 It would be understandable if such programs were not successful, but many of these have proved popular enough to continue running for several decades. One prime example is Pretty Cure, a long-running magical girl anime that has been around for over 20 years. It\u2019s one of Toei Animation\u2019s most popular properties, rivaling even Sailor Moon in terms of cultural impact in its home country. Despite its massive success, only two of the series within this storied franchise have ever been picked up for English localization.  The original series, Futari Wa Pretty Cure, was picked up by several companies including Funimation, 4Kids and YTV. Only YTV has ever broadcast the show on television, but because it is a Canadian broadcasting channel, this means Futari Wa Pretty Cure was never shown in the US. It is, however, still available for streaming on Prime Video and Hulu. Doki Doki Pretty Cure was picked up by Hasbro and dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. It was renamed to the slightly more aggressive Glitter Force and is currently available for streaming on Netflix. Like most children\u2019s anime from the early 2000s, the story was heavily cut and edited to remove any explicit references to Japanese culture as well as material deemed too \u201cmature\u201d for its target audience, such as references to death. As of this writing, this was the last Pretty Cure anime to be officially dubbed in English. While Crunchyroll has started streaming the newer entries in the franchise, no other companies have made any attempts to dub or market it to the western audience.  RELATED: Lady Gaga, Crunchyroll Team Up for New Apparel Collection                 While shoujo anime have not had as much trouble finding an audience in the west, one would be hard-pressed to find such shows airing on network television. Toonami has aired a few female-led shows in the past, but none were explicitly made with a female audience in mind. After the success of Sailor Moon, 4Kids made a few attempts to tap into the magical girl market by picking up Tokyo Mew Mew, or Mew Mew Power as it\u2019s known in the west. It found some level of success, but not nearly to the same degree as Sailor Moon. A further attempt was made with yet another Toei Animation property, Ojamajo Doremi, which predictably received a new westernized name: Magical Doremi. It proved even less successful and suffered from consistently low ratings. 4Kids never finished airing the entire series, with the last 25 episodes going straight to the network\u2019s website instead. 4Kids also gained the rights to Futari Wa Pretty Cure, but it never released any episodes before the series was eventually picked up by another distributor.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 The failure of such anime can be attributed to a number of things -- none of which can be faulted to the shows themselves, but rather, mismanagement on the part of the companies distributing them. Magical Doremi aired at 7:30 am, too early in the morning for most kids to want to tune in on a Saturday. Cardcaptors received heavy backlash from fans of the original source material. When Pioneer gained the rights to distribute the original series on home video -- completely unedited and uncut in the original Japanese dub -- the sub-only DVDs outsold the dub-only DVDs by more than 10,000 units. Likewise, many long-time Pretty Cure fans responded negatively to Hasbro\u2019s decisions to edit and westernize the English dub for Glitter Force -- a practice that in this day and age is no longer considered acceptable. Even the English dubs for the likes of Beyblade keep the original Japanese names and references intact.  It truly is a shame that more companies aren\u2019t willing to put more time and interest in anime aimed at young girls. If they would simply put the same amount of effort into marketing such shows the way they do with Bakugan or Pok\u00e9mon, there\u2019s definite success to be had. There\u2019s a plethora of magical girl and shoujo anime that will never be exported as a result. For now, magical girl aficionados will have to be content with streaming the latest iteration of Pretty Cure subbed.                  What Makes Tokyo Mew Mew So Special?

As Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore nears its stateside release, the future of the Harry Potter prequel series is reportedly up in the air.  According to Variety, while the Fantastic Beasts series was previously announced as being a five-film saga, sources have confirmed that there is currently no screenplay for Fantastic Beasts 4. Furthermore, executives at Warner Bros. Pictures are \"waiting to see how The Secrets of Dumbledore is received before giving films four and five the greenlight [sic].\" RELATED: Fantastic Beasts Debuts a Fiery Secrets of Dumbledore IMAX Poster    Despite the pedigree of the Harry Potter franchise, the third Fantastic Beasts film is facing an uphill battle at the box office. The Secrets of Dumbledore is expected to bring in between $100 million and $140 million domestically, which would make it the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film yet. The film already had the lowest international opening for the franchise, earning $58 million from 22 oversees markets over the weekend of April 8.  Variety also notes the various controversies the Fantastic Beasts franchise has had to contend with, such as Johnny Depp (who played antagonist Gellert Grindelwald in the first two films) being forced to exit the franchise after losing his libel lawsuit against the British tabloid The Sun. Meanwhile, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling has continued to garner criticism for her controversial views on gender identity, while Fantastic Beasts actor Ezra Miller has faced legal troubles of their own. Then, there's the matter of Discovery's acquisition of WarnerMedia, which has seen WarnerMedia chairman Ann Sarnoff -- who oversaw the Harry Potter franchise -- depart the company.  RELATED: Warner Bros. Defends Cutting Fantastic Beasts 3's Gay Dialogue in China The Fantastic Beasts series began in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film set several decades prior to the events of the Harry Potter series. The film was a box office success, making $814 worldwide, and was met with mostly positive reviews, currently holding an approval rating of 74 percent and the \"Certified Fresh\" distinction on Rotten Tomatoes. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was originally announced as the start of a trilogy, though one month before the film's release, it was announced that the new series would actually consist of five films.  The series' second film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, released in theaters in 2018.It made $655 million worldwide against a budget of $200 million, making it the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film to date. The Crimes of Grindelwald is also far and away the worst-reviewed Harry Potter film to date, currently holding an approval rating of 36 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.

Thus far, the Fantastic Beasts threequel has been met with lukewarm reviews, though has decidedly been better received than The Crimes of Grindelwald, currently holding a 58 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

As Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore nears its stateside release, the future of the Harry Potter prequel series is reportedly up in the air.  According to Variety, while the Fantastic Beasts series was previously announced as being a five-film saga, sources have confirmed that there is currently no screenplay for Fantastic Beasts 4. Furthermore, executives at Warner Bros. Pictures are \"waiting to see how The Secrets of Dumbledore is received before giving films four and five the greenlight [sic].\" RELATED: Fantastic Beasts Debuts a Fiery Secrets of Dumbledore IMAX Poster    Despite the pedigree of the Harry Potter franchise, the third Fantastic Beasts film is facing an uphill battle at the box office. The Secrets of Dumbledore is expected to bring in between $100 million and $140 million domestically, which would make it the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film yet. The film already had the lowest international opening for the franchise, earning $58 million from 22 oversees markets over the weekend of April 8.  Variety also notes the various controversies the Fantastic Beasts franchise has had to contend with, such as Johnny Depp (who played antagonist Gellert Grindelwald in the first two films) being forced to exit the franchise after losing his libel lawsuit against the British tabloid The Sun. Meanwhile, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling has continued to garner criticism for her controversial views on gender identity, while Fantastic Beasts actor Ezra Miller has faced legal troubles of their own. Then, there's the matter of Discovery's acquisition of WarnerMedia, which has seen WarnerMedia chairman Ann Sarnoff -- who oversaw the Harry Potter franchise -- depart the company.  RELATED: Warner Bros. Defends Cutting Fantastic Beasts 3's Gay Dialogue in China The Fantastic Beasts series began in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a film set several decades prior to the events of the Harry Potter series. The film was a box office success, making $814 worldwide, and was met with mostly positive reviews, currently holding an approval rating of 74 percent and the \"Certified Fresh\" distinction on Rotten Tomatoes. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was originally announced as the start of a trilogy, though one month before the film's release, it was announced that the new series would actually consist of five films.  The series' second film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, released in theaters in 2018.It made $655 million worldwide against a budget of $200 million, making it the lowest-grossing Harry Potter film to date. The Crimes of Grindelwald is also far and away the worst-reviewed Harry Potter film to date, currently holding an approval rating of 36 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.

Thus far, the Fantastic Beasts threequel has been met with lukewarm reviews, though has decidedly been better received than The Crimes of Grindelwald, currently holding a 58 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore releases in theaters in the U.S. on April 15.

The world of Japanese anime and manga features numerous famous and mainstream romance and drama titles, such as the shojo classic Fruits Basket starring the lovers Tohru and Kyo, along with shows such as Maid-Sama! and many others. However, many other solid romances fall right under the radar, including the underrated After the Rain.  This short but sweet manga/anime franchise, created by Jun Mayuzuki, tells the tale of the kind-hearted kuudere heroine Akira Tachibana and her one-sided crush on her manager at work, a single father named Masami Kondo. What follows is not an awkward romance between a teenager and a middle-aged man, but rather a tale of healing and self-acceptance told in the framework of a would-be romance. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          The Tale Of Healing In After The Rain                At first glance, After the Rain is a traditional romance story that could potentially be problematic given that the heroine Akira is 17 years old and Mr. Kondo is 45 -- old enough to be Akira's father. Many anime fans know that various franchises have pushed things with iffy romances before, but fortunately, After the Rain has much more finesse than that. Akira nurses a strong crush on Mr. Kondo and expresses it more than once, but as a smart and responsible man, Mr. Kondo keeps Akira at arm's length and treats her as a platonic friend. This means that the story is less about conventional romance and more about healing the heart. There are more routes for a romance story to take than a predictable \"happily ever after\" riding into the sunset.  After the Rain uses its would-be romance story as the framework for something just as sweet and inspiring as a wholesome romance -- that being a story of healing and self-acceptance. In many cases, a romance isn't just about longing and lust but also about how love can potentially soothe a wounded heart and help a person come to terms with their own problems. This isn't always the case, but when things go right, a romance can heal and strengthen both people in the relationship, whether or not they start going steady or eventually marry. This is exactly the case with After the Rain. In this story, Akira Tachibana is passionate about running track, but a recent leg injury sidelined her, and she feels miserable about her everyday life as a high school student missing out on track meets. She busies herself by working at a restaurant named Garden, where she soon develops a crush on her kind-hearted manager, who gives off a paternal and nurturing vibe. Most likely, this is what drew Akira to him, as her heart needed healing and Mr. Kondo's personality is all about generosity and caring for others.  In the end, the two of them don't get together, but they didn't have to. Akira's leg and heart both recover, and soon after turning 18, she resumes running track and finds happiness once again. Meanwhile, Akira's youthful innocence and energy inspire Mr. Kondo to reignite his passion for literature and writing, which he had abandoned years ago. On his platonic dates with Akira, he often encouraged her to embrace literature and learning, but he benefited from this almost as much as Akira did and was much happier for it. RELATED: The Best Comedy High School Anime Series You Can Watch Right Now          How After The Rain Portrays A Restrained Romance                To begin with, After the Rain shows restraint by not showing any explicit scenes between Akira and Mr. Kondo -- in fact, it's highly unlikely that any such scenes took place at all, whether shown on-screen or not. This may be a romantic seinen manga/anime franchise, but the author saw no need to throw in some fan service just for the sake of it. Doing so would sabotage After the Rain's wholesome message about healing and might stir up unwanted controversy as well. It's clear that Akira's crush on Mr. Kondo is strong and genuine, especially when Akira directly tells Mr. Kondo about it. All the same, Mr. Kondo and the narrative alike hold back, knowing that Akira is off-limits to a man his age. Instead, Mr. Kondo acts more like a role model and parental figure for Akira. Akira is the only one with a crush, and this is largely portrayed as the kind of innocent crush schoolgirls get on their handsome, kind-hearted male teachers.  These harmless crushes don't lead to a serious romance, but they might inspire the amorous character to push themselves harder to live up to their crush's expectations of them, growing as a person in the process. This is the route After the Rain follows, and in turn, any fan of the series can follow its example and better themselves with the power of self-acceptance and healing.

The world of Japanese anime and manga features numerous famous and mainstream romance and drama titles, such as the shojo classic Fruits Basket starring the lovers Tohru and Kyo, along with shows such as Maid-Sama! and many others. However, many other solid romances fall right under the radar, including the underrated After the Rain.  This short but sweet manga/anime franchise, created by Jun Mayuzuki, tells the tale of the kind-hearted kuudere heroine Akira Tachibana and her one-sided crush on her manager at work, a single father named Masami Kondo. What follows is not an awkward romance between a teenager and a middle-aged man, but rather a tale of healing and self-acceptance told in the framework of a would-be romance. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          The Tale Of Healing In After The Rain                At first glance, After the Rain is a traditional romance story that could potentially be problematic given that the heroine Akira is 17 years old and Mr. Kondo is 45 -- old enough to be Akira's father. Many anime fans know that various franchises have pushed things with iffy romances before, but fortunately, After the Rain has much more finesse than that. Akira nurses a strong crush on Mr. Kondo and expresses it more than once, but as a smart and responsible man, Mr. Kondo keeps Akira at arm's length and treats her as a platonic friend. This means that the story is less about conventional romance and more about healing the heart. There are more routes for a romance story to take than a predictable \"happily ever after\" riding into the sunset.  After the Rain uses its would-be romance story as the framework for something just as sweet and inspiring as a wholesome romance -- that being a story of healing and self-acceptance. In many cases, a romance isn't just about longing and lust but also about how love can potentially soothe a wounded heart and help a person come to terms with their own problems. This isn't always the case, but when things go right, a romance can heal and strengthen both people in the relationship, whether or not they start going steady or eventually marry. This is exactly the case with After the Rain. In this story, Akira Tachibana is passionate about running track, but a recent leg injury sidelined her, and she feels miserable about her everyday life as a high school student missing out on track meets. She busies herself by working at a restaurant named Garden, where she soon develops a crush on her kind-hearted manager, who gives off a paternal and nurturing vibe. Most likely, this is what drew Akira to him, as her heart needed healing and Mr. Kondo's personality is all about generosity and caring for others.  In the end, the two of them don't get together, but they didn't have to. Akira's leg and heart both recover, and soon after turning 18, she resumes running track and finds happiness once again. Meanwhile, Akira's youthful innocence and energy inspire Mr. Kondo to reignite his passion for literature and writing, which he had abandoned years ago. On his platonic dates with Akira, he often encouraged her to embrace literature and learning, but he benefited from this almost as much as Akira did and was much happier for it. RELATED: The Best Comedy High School Anime Series You Can Watch Right Now          How After The Rain Portrays A Restrained Romance                To begin with, After the Rain shows restraint by not showing any explicit scenes between Akira and Mr. Kondo -- in fact, it's highly unlikely that any such scenes took place at all, whether shown on-screen or not. This may be a romantic seinen manga/anime franchise, but the author saw no need to throw in some fan service just for the sake of it. Doing so would sabotage After the Rain's wholesome message about healing and might stir up unwanted controversy as well. It's clear that Akira's crush on Mr. Kondo is strong and genuine, especially when Akira directly tells Mr. Kondo about it. All the same, Mr. Kondo and the narrative alike hold back, knowing that Akira is off-limits to a man his age. Instead, Mr. Kondo acts more like a role model and parental figure for Akira. Akira is the only one with a crush, and this is largely portrayed as the kind of innocent crush schoolgirls get on their handsome, kind-hearted male teachers.  These harmless crushes don't lead to a serious romance, but they might inspire the amorous character to push themselves harder to live up to their crush's expectations of them, growing as a person in the process. This is the route After the Rain follows, and in turn, any fan of the series can follow its example and better themselves with the power of self-acceptance and healing.

Kirby and the Forgotten Land has been a huge hit among new and old fans of the franchise. Along with the introduction of over a dozen adorable Mouthful Modes, which transform Kirby into objects like ice cream cones and light bulbs, entertaining puzzles throughout each stage. These help players complete the many puzzles the game offers.  The main puzzles for players to solve in this Nintendo Switch title is the rescue of a certain number of hidden Waddle Dees in every level. There are also Blueprints hidden in several stages, which players use to upgrade Kirby's copy abilities. Each stage has several missions for players to complete to collect all the Waddle Dees. One of these is the location of five Beast-Base wanted posters in the Beast Pack's Final Stand stage in the Redgar Forbidden Lands world.

The live-action version of the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure spinoff Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe is now available for streaming outside of Japan.  As reported by Anime News Network, RetroCrush, a free streaming service specializing in classic anime and other content from Asian countries, announced that the first season of the 2020 Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe TV series is now available on its platform. The show is based on Hirohiko Araki's spinoff manga of the same name, which details the further adventures of Rohan Kishibe, a Stand user and manga author who was first introduced in Jojo's fourth arc, Diamond is Unbreakable. The first season is three episodes long. A second season, which aired in Japan in 2021, has not received an official release outside of Japan at this time.  RELATED: Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Heroes Unite in Generation Spanning Anniversary Art The series is directed by Kazutaka Watanabe and is written by Yasuko Kobayashi, who has previously worked on David Production's popular anime adaptation of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Kishibe is portrayed by actor Issei Takahashi, who anime fans may recognize from his appearances in the live-action adaptations of Ikebukuro West Gate Park and March Comes in Like a Lion. In addition to the live-action show, the spinoff was also adapted into an anime, which is available for streaming on Netflix. Rohan Kishibe is just one of the many eccentric characters who have appeared in Araki's long-runnin opus, which began publication in 1987. The series tells the story of the Joestar family and their cross-generational conflict with the being known as Dio Brando. The anime adaptation is currently on its fifth season, Stone Ocean, which adapts the sixth part of the on-going series and is available as a streaming exclusive through Netflix. The first 12 episodes of the arc premiered in December; the next batch of episodes is scheduled to be released sometime next fall. A ninth part of the manga has also been confirmed to be in production, though it has yet to receive a release date.  RELATED: RetroCrush Streams Hajime No Ippo Anime, Classic Sonic Cartoon In addition to Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe, RetroCrush has also added a number of other titles that will be of interest to hardcore anime fans, including Hideaki Anno: The Final Challenge of Evangelion, a two-part documentary that follows creator Hideaki Anno as he works on the last film in the series. Shojo fans should also look into the classically focused streaming service, as it also recently added the live-action adaptations of Boys Over Flowers, Nodame Cantabile and Itazura Na Kiss to its library as well.

The live-action version of the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure spinoff Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe is now available for streaming outside of Japan.  As reported by Anime News Network, RetroCrush, a free streaming service specializing in classic anime and other content from Asian countries, announced that the first season of the 2020 Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe TV series is now available on its platform. The show is based on Hirohiko Araki's spinoff manga of the same name, which details the further adventures of Rohan Kishibe, a Stand user and manga author who was first introduced in Jojo's fourth arc, Diamond is Unbreakable. The first season is three episodes long. A second season, which aired in Japan in 2021, has not received an official release outside of Japan at this time.  RELATED: Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Heroes Unite in Generation Spanning Anniversary Art The series is directed by Kazutaka Watanabe and is written by Yasuko Kobayashi, who has previously worked on David Production's popular anime adaptation of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Kishibe is portrayed by actor Issei Takahashi, who anime fans may recognize from his appearances in the live-action adaptations of Ikebukuro West Gate Park and March Comes in Like a Lion. In addition to the live-action show, the spinoff was also adapted into an anime, which is available for streaming on Netflix. Rohan Kishibe is just one of the many eccentric characters who have appeared in Araki's long-runnin opus, which began publication in 1987. The series tells the story of the Joestar family and their cross-generational conflict with the being known as Dio Brando. The anime adaptation is currently on its fifth season, Stone Ocean, which adapts the sixth part of the on-going series and is available as a streaming exclusive through Netflix. The first 12 episodes of the arc premiered in December; the next batch of episodes is scheduled to be released sometime next fall. A ninth part of the manga has also been confirmed to be in production, though it has yet to receive a release date.  RELATED: RetroCrush Streams Hajime No Ippo Anime, Classic Sonic Cartoon In addition to Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe, RetroCrush has also added a number of other titles that will be of interest to hardcore anime fans, including Hideaki Anno: The Final Challenge of Evangelion, a two-part documentary that follows creator Hideaki Anno as he works on the last film in the series. Shojo fans should also look into the classically focused streaming service, as it also recently added the live-action adaptations of Boys Over Flowers, Nodame Cantabile and Itazura Na Kiss to its library as well.

Chef's Kiss   Writer  Jarrett Melendez    Artist  Danica Brine    Letterer  Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou    Publisher  Oni Press    Price  14.99    Release Date  2022-04-12    Colorist  Hank Jones      So often, coming-of-age stories focus on teens, ignoring the fact that people never stop growing and taking on new roles and responsibilities. When a graphic novel does dare to explore what it's like to go through major periods of change as an adult, it is a breath of fresh air, and that is exactly what Chef's Kiss is. Written by Jarrett Melendez, art by Danica Brine, colors by Hank Jones, and letters by Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, Chef's Kiss is about Ben Cook, a recent college graduate struggling to find work in his field of study. He decides to apply for a job at a restaurant, where he not only learns more about himself but also develops feelings for one of the chefs working there, Liam.  While the title of the graphic novel makes it seem like this is primarily a romance story, Chef's Kiss actually puts focus on Ben's personal growth first and foremost. For those wanting a hot and heavy love story that dominates the book, Chef's Kiss may disappoint; however, the graphic novel is a sweet, slow burn. More importantly, it's a story about self-love and discovery, with Ben going on a transformative journey that asks a question most 20-somethings wonder: what do I actually want? RELATED: Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing                Many people are taught that they are supposed to know exactly what they want in life as teens. They are often told that if they follow a specific path perfectly, they will then achieve this goal. However, Chef's Kiss shows that those goals and wants change over time, and even when people do everything right, they may not see the promised results. Chef's Kiss beautifully demonstrates the hard truths of becoming an adult, but it does so in a way that is still hopeful. For those just entering this stage of life, it prepares them for what actually lies ahead. Meanwhile, for those who have moved beyond it or who are still going through it, Chef's Kiss validates this frustrating, stressful, and exciting period of life.  Chef's Kiss also pays attention to the other relationships in one's life beyond the romantic ones. Parental, platonic, and work relationships all get their time to be fleshed out, with the platonic ones particularly reminding readers that all relationships go through hardships and need to be worked on to become stronger. The fact these relationships feel so real is a testament to the characters themselves, as they feel developed with room to grow. The romantic relationship is cute and captures what it feels like to have a crush on someone. Chef's Kiss isn't afraid to show some of the embarrassing and confusing moments that come with a crush.  RELATED: Cities of Magick #1 Comic Review At the end of the day, Chef's Kiss reads as sweet, especially given the art style. Brine finds a great balance between the realistic and the cartoonish, letting the characters' expressions speak for themselves. The anatomy, in particular, is a stand-out as it feels realistic while also capturing what these two cooks find attractive in one another. It would also be a shame not to discuss the food in Chef's Kiss, as Melendez puts great care into these recipes. How he writes about food makes one want to try the dishes themselves, especially after seeing how Brine illustrates them. They look delicious and like something one could actually order for themselves at a quaint restaurant. Thankfully, the back of Chef's Kiss includes a few of those recipes for readers to try out themselves.  While not a spicy romance, Chef's Kiss is certainly sweet with lots of heart. It goes beyond being a love story, delivering a message so many readers need to hear. That, accompanied by a cast of characters forming a beautiful found family, makes Chef's Kiss a great comic to read with a warm cup of tea and fresh pear tartlet.
