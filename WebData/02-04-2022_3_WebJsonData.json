        Akebi-san had a brief explanation in her announcement, the girl likes a sailor uniform and wants to have friends.

It is a great joy to observe such a detailed image along with well-chosen music.\r Character building also adds value. Each of the girls in Akebi-san's class has her own unique character, each is different in her own way and we have a chance to enjoy their diversity. \r Unfortunately, as the supporting characters are interesting, the heroine is the mary sue of the series. Despite a few shortcomings, she is presented in the series as special and is the centrepiece of everything, and what other classmates thoughts. She\u2019s the force that pushes them to action, but the time allocated to make it unique in the series is too large and clear. The series would benefit if the time only for the side heroes were increased. One gets the impression that the entire class has created a harem and a cult around her. It rejected me and irritated me, the heroine herself didn\u2019t show many emotions apart from the first episode, playing the 'angel' 'goddess' \u2018the special one\u2019 in the whole class. \r Ultimately, I didn't get much pleasure from the screening being bored with the slow story and the main character. The series may appeal to people who prefer to calmly watch the school life of the heroes and won\u2019t be disturbed by yuri themes.

                         Everything that I liked about the first season disappeared in this second. We see the best protagonist he can be, when he should be a sadist who doesn't care about anything except his harem. Another bad thing chose only a waifu but still continues to travel and delude the harem. After the animation is bad, the soundtrack is so-so and the plot in general is quite predictable, I don't understand who might like this second season. On top of that they changed a waifu for an albino but only in the bodies not all bad with the anime. Do yourself a favor and look at something else. On top of that, the protagonist gets cold but later when they ask him for something he is helping them like nothing happened, I can't believe he's so homosexual, go ahead and become a man. Terrible don't watch this shit.\r En espa\u00f1ol:\r Todo lo que me habia gustado de la primera temporada desaparecio en esta segunda. Vemos al protagonista mas bueno que puede ser, cuando tendria que ser un sadico que no le importa nada solo su harem. Otra cosa mala eligio solo a una waifu pero iguialmente sigue viajando y ilusionando al harem. Despues la aniamcion es mala, la banda sonora regular y la trama en general es bastante predecible no entiendo a quien le puede gustar esta segunda temporada. Encima cambiaron una waifu por una albina pero solo en los cuerpos no todo mal con el anime. Haganse se el favor y miren otra cosa. Encima el protagonista se hace el frio pero despues cuando le piden algo esta ayudandolos como si nada, no lo puedo creer que sea tan homosexual dale hacete hombre.

We see the best protagonist he can be, when he should be a sadist who doesn't care about anything except his harem. Another bad thing chose only a waifu but still continues to travel and delude the harem. After the animation is bad, the soundtrack is so-so and the plot in general is quite predictable, I don't understand who might like this second season. On top of that they changed a waifu for an albino but only in the bodies not all bad with the anime. Do yourself a favor and look at something else. On top of that, the protagonist gets cold but later when they ask him for something he is helping them like nothing happened, I can't believe he's so homosexual, go ahead and become a man. Terrible don't watch this shit.\r En espa\u00f1ol:\r Todo lo que me habia gustado de la primera temporada desaparecio en esta segunda. Vemos al protagonista mas bueno que puede ser, cuando tendria que ser un sadico que no le importa nada solo su harem. Otra cosa mala eligio solo a una waifu pero iguialmente sigue viajando y ilusionando al harem. Despues la aniamcion es mala, la banda sonora regular y la trama en general es bastante predecible no entiendo a quien le puede gustar esta segunda temporada. Encima cambiaron una waifu por una albina pero solo en los cuerpos no todo mal con el anime. Haganse se el favor y miren otra cosa. Encima el protagonista se hace el frio pero despues cuando le piden algo esta ayudandolos como si nada, no lo puedo creer que sea tan homosexual dale hacete hombre.

Bushiroad is a well-known company among most anime fans, as they are responsible for a decent bulk of music-based anime and rhythm games, some of which include Love Live, BanG Dream, and Project Sekai. Their most recent project is D4DJ, a music-based rhythm game revolving around six four piece DJ units, each with their own unique story and style. Since most of their past projects have gotten anime adaptations, D4DJ was no exception. And after getting hooked on the D4DJ mobile game (I have a rhythm game addiction, don't bully me), I decided to watch the anime (although I was just a little bit late to the party).  \r D4DJ: First Mix is one of the exact reasons why Bushiroad is the dominator of rhythm games and their related anime. Complete with a heartwarming story and extremely likeable characters, this anime is anything but your average idol story. In a mere 13 episodes, each character is fully fleshed out and developed, and the story never feels the slightest bit forced.  \r One of my doubts upon starting this anime was how well the characters would be developed. While I did enjoy the previous BanG Dream anime, I found that quite a few characters were significantly more developed than others. This is likely because of the attempt to introduce five different bands at once. With six different units, I was more than a little worried.  \r Thankfully, only three of the groups from the game are included in this anime: Happy Around, Peaky P-Key and Photon Maiden. The other three groups were only given small cameos or background appearances, and while fans of said groups may complain, I would argue that this made the anime even better. The writers didn't attempt to shove a cast of twenty characters down our throat at once and make us immediately love them all. They instead took their time with the introductions so that we could love and appreciate all of them.  \r I also found all of the characters extremely likeable. There wasn't a single one I disliked. Upon starting the mobile game, I admit, I found Happy Around somewhat boring compared to the other more unique units. However, in the anime, they somehow skyrocketed up to being my favorite unit out of all six. Rinku's bubbly and easygoing and has this innocent aura surrounding her that always makes me smile. Maho is cool-headed and confident with plenty of knowledge about music, and I got to learn quite a few of the basics of trackmaking from her. Muni's adorable and reminds me of Niko Yazawa, one of my all-time favorite characters from anime, except she's more realistic and human (it appears she may be challenging Niko for first-place in my anime character rankings). And Rei is shy, sweet and talented with a beautifully angelic voice. She really reminds me of myself, as we're both shy and anxious, but also love music.  \r One of my favorite things from the anime is undoubtedly the friendships between the girls. They all fit so well together and I found myself smiling every time they were on screen together. Some of them even branched out and made friends with the girls from other units, like Rinku and Towa and Maho and Shinobu. I particularly loved the friendship between Rinku and Muni. It reminded me of how much I miss my old friends from grade school, and episode twelve was such a real episode for me. When the two of them fight about things in the past, it just felt so...real. I really don't know how to describe it. It just really touched me.  \r Some people may complain about the animation over anything else, as the anime is animated fully in CGI. This may annoy a lot of people who prefer classic animation, but if anything, I think the CGI just enhanced the anime and the story even further. The expressions and movements of the characters looked much more fluid than they would have if the animators had used classic animation, and it also helped the characters look more expressive. The little details and changes in the animation depending on the respective character was also impressive. I loved how when Rinku was invited on-stage to perform with Peaky P-Key, her dancing was more energetic. I loved how at the very end, when all three of the units performed together, Towa was the only one who knew Happy Around's choreography. It's the little details that help the story flow more smoothly.  \r Since it is a music anime, I should also say a thing or two about the sound. And I personally thought the music was outstanding. There was not a single song I disliked. I am a huge fan of electronic music, and the ability of the producers to fuse electronic music and idol pop was incredibly impressive. Every song sounded unique and fit the feel of each unit perfectly.  \r In the end, D4DJ: First Mix was nearly perfect. The only criticism I really have is that while some characters were animated in CGI, others were animated with classic animation. It just felt really lazy to give some characters CGI animated models and to just use classic animation on the side characters. It also looked very out of place...almost jarring. Other than that, the anime was absolutely amazing. I hope to see a second season in the future so I can learn about the other three units and their stories.

Their most recent project is D4DJ, a music-based rhythm game revolving around six four piece DJ units, each with their own unique story and style. Since most of their past projects have gotten anime adaptations, D4DJ was no exception. And after getting hooked on the D4DJ mobile game (I have a rhythm game addiction, don't bully me), I decided to watch the anime (although I was just a little bit late to the party).  \r D4DJ: First Mix is one of the exact reasons why Bushiroad is the dominator of rhythm games and their related anime. Complete with a heartwarming story and extremely likeable characters, this anime is anything but your average idol story. In a mere 13 episodes, each character is fully fleshed out and developed, and the story never feels the slightest bit forced.  \r One of my doubts upon starting this anime was how well the characters would be developed. While I did enjoy the previous BanG Dream anime, I found that quite a few characters were significantly more developed than others. This is likely because of the attempt to introduce five different bands at once. With six different units, I was more than a little worried.  \r Thankfully, only three of the groups from the game are included in this anime: Happy Around, Peaky P-Key and Photon Maiden. The other three groups were only given small cameos or background appearances, and while fans of said groups may complain, I would argue that this made the anime even better. The writers didn't attempt to shove a cast of twenty characters down our throat at once and make us immediately love them all. They instead took their time with the introductions so that we could love and appreciate all of them.  \r I also found all of the characters extremely likeable. There wasn't a single one I disliked. Upon starting the mobile game, I admit, I found Happy Around somewhat boring compared to the other more unique units. However, in the anime, they somehow skyrocketed up to being my favorite unit out of all six. Rinku's bubbly and easygoing and has this innocent aura surrounding her that always makes me smile. Maho is cool-headed and confident with plenty of knowledge about music, and I got to learn quite a few of the basics of trackmaking from her. Muni's adorable and reminds me of Niko Yazawa, one of my all-time favorite characters from anime, except she's more realistic and human (it appears she may be challenging Niko for first-place in my anime character rankings). And Rei is shy, sweet and talented with a beautifully angelic voice. She really reminds me of myself, as we're both shy and anxious, but also love music.  \r One of my favorite things from the anime is undoubtedly the friendships between the girls. They all fit so well together and I found myself smiling every time they were on screen together. Some of them even branched out and made friends with the girls from other units, like Rinku and Towa and Maho and Shinobu. I particularly loved the friendship between Rinku and Muni. It reminded me of how much I miss my old friends from grade school, and episode twelve was such a real episode for me. When the two of them fight about things in the past, it just felt so...real. I really don't know how to describe it. It just really touched me.  \r Some people may complain about the animation over anything else, as the anime is animated fully in CGI. This may annoy a lot of people who prefer classic animation, but if anything, I think the CGI just enhanced the anime and the story even further. The expressions and movements of the characters looked much more fluid than they would have if the animators had used classic animation, and it also helped the characters look more expressive. The little details and changes in the animation depending on the respective character was also impressive. I loved how when Rinku was invited on-stage to perform with Peaky P-Key, her dancing was more energetic. I loved how at the very end, when all three of the units performed together, Towa was the only one who knew Happy Around's choreography. It's the little details that help the story flow more smoothly.  \r Since it is a music anime, I should also say a thing or two about the sound. And I personally thought the music was outstanding. There was not a single song I disliked. I am a huge fan of electronic music, and the ability of the producers to fuse electronic music and idol pop was incredibly impressive. Every song sounded unique and fit the feel of each unit perfectly.  \r In the end, D4DJ: First Mix was nearly perfect. The only criticism I really have is that while some characters were animated in CGI, others were animated with classic animation. It just felt really lazy to give some characters CGI animated models and to just use classic animation on the side characters. It also looked very out of place...almost jarring.

The sound are pretty iconic, mainly the background music, sound effects, iconic dialogues and most importantly, the opening and ending song. These created a whole generation of fans, and from just hearing the iconic songs like \"Haruka Kanat\", \"Kanashimi wo Yasashisani ni\", or \"Viva Rock (Japanese Side)\", or \"Harumonia\" creates a nostalgic feels... \r I gave a 4 out of 10 for the character, because this have so many filler arcs, this creates a whole bunch of forgettable characters, and, like I said in the story, becomes a detriment to the overall story telling... \r I give it a 6 out of 10 for the enjoyment.
