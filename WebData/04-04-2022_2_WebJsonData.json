One Punch Man: ONE Technique Would Allow Goku to DESTROY Saitama        DBZ Vs. One Punch Man: ONE Technique Would Allow Goku to DESTROY Saitama Goku has one particular trick up his sleeve that would allow him to completely dominate One-Punch Man's Saitama in a fight.     By Sam Stone Updated 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the protagonists of two of the most popular manga/anime franchises around, Dragon Ball's Goku and One-Punch Man's Saitama are often compared to one another, especially in regards to which of the characters would win in a knockdown, drag-out fight. While Goku is one of the most powerful fighters in the entire Dragon Ball franchise, he is by no means unbeatable and has endured crushing defeats on multiple occasions. And, true to the series' name, Saitama is comedically overpowered, able to withstand the most devastating attacks without flinching, and dispatch each and every opponent with a single blow.  Despite this difference in win-loss record, Goku may have discovered a new technique that could give him the edge over Saitama in a hypothetical showdown between the two: Ultra Instinct. RELATED: Dragon Ball Rumor Teases an All-New Super Saiyan God Ultra Instinct Might Allow Goku to Damage Saitama                  Introduced at the end of Dragon Ball Super, Goku absorbed the energy from a failed Super Spirit Bomb when fighting against the alternate universe champion Jiren during the Tournament of Power. The power surge in energy and sheer physical exertion from Goku throughout the martial arts competition caused him to break past his normal limitations and tap into the raw combat power of the gods themselves. While Goku had difficulty in initially mastering the form and maintaining more than several minutes, the Saiyan appeared to gain control of it by the end of the Tournament -- so long as he did not maintain the transformation for a prolonged period of time. While it is unclear if even this divine power boost will give Goku enough strength to even damage Saitama, it does possess one noticeable advantage -- even before Goku was able to fully master it: Goku's defensive reflexes are heightened to a virtually supernatural level as he is able to dodge any incoming attack with significant ease. With this augmented ability, Goku was able to eliminate the powerful, fused Super Saiyan Kefla from the tournament, while wearing down Jiren considerably, setting up his own elimination at the contest's end by Goku, Frieza and Android 17. And while Goku would still have trouble returning to the transformation in the anime, the fan-favorite character took a much different path in the manga continuation series. After being beaten by the magical villain Moro, Goku began training under the angel Merus to defeat the new enemy and the insidious prisoners he had freed with the Namekian Dragon Balls. Goku was now able to transform into the unmastered Ultra Instinct at will, though he could still not maintain it for more than several minutes at a time due to the immense physical exertion his body is subjected to. However, with its exponential power boost, several minutes may be all he needs to get the job done and completely outmatch his opponent with a well-placed Kamehameha Wave.

But the trick in being successful as a One-Punch Man is that one has to be able to land that single punch. With Ultra Instinct, master or not, Goku could evade all of Saitama's attacks leaving his prodigious, signature ability completely useless. Combine that with the already vast array of abilities that Goku has at his disposal after a life (or three) of martial arts training, and Saitama could quickly find himself in over his head.

One Punch Man: ONE Technique Would Allow Goku to DESTROY Saitama Goku has one particular trick up his sleeve that would allow him to completely dominate One-Punch Man's Saitama in a fight.     By Sam Stone Updated 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the protagonists of two of the most popular manga/anime franchises around, Dragon Ball's Goku and One-Punch Man's Saitama are often compared to one another, especially in regards to which of the characters would win in a knockdown, drag-out fight. While Goku is one of the most powerful fighters in the entire Dragon Ball franchise, he is by no means unbeatable and has endured crushing defeats on multiple occasions. And, true to the series' name, Saitama is comedically overpowered, able to withstand the most devastating attacks without flinching, and dispatch each and every opponent with a single blow.  Despite this difference in win-loss record, Goku may have discovered a new technique that could give him the edge over Saitama in a hypothetical showdown between the two: Ultra Instinct. RELATED: Dragon Ball Rumor Teases an All-New Super Saiyan God Ultra Instinct Might Allow Goku to Damage Saitama                  Introduced at the end of Dragon Ball Super, Goku absorbed the energy from a failed Super Spirit Bomb when fighting against the alternate universe champion Jiren during the Tournament of Power. The power surge in energy and sheer physical exertion from Goku throughout the martial arts competition caused him to break past his normal limitations and tap into the raw combat power of the gods themselves. While Goku had difficulty in initially mastering the form and maintaining more than several minutes, the Saiyan appeared to gain control of it by the end of the Tournament -- so long as he did not maintain the transformation for a prolonged period of time. While it is unclear if even this divine power boost will give Goku enough strength to even damage Saitama, it does possess one noticeable advantage -- even before Goku was able to fully master it: Goku's defensive reflexes are heightened to a virtually supernatural level as he is able to dodge any incoming attack with significant ease. With this augmented ability, Goku was able to eliminate the powerful, fused Super Saiyan Kefla from the tournament, while wearing down Jiren considerably, setting up his own elimination at the contest's end by Goku, Frieza and Android 17. And while Goku would still have trouble returning to the transformation in the anime, the fan-favorite character took a much different path in the manga continuation series. After being beaten by the magical villain Moro, Goku began training under the angel Merus to defeat the new enemy and the insidious prisoners he had freed with the Namekian Dragon Balls. Goku was now able to transform into the unmastered Ultra Instinct at will, though he could still not maintain it for more than several minutes at a time due to the immense physical exertion his body is subjected to. However, with its exponential power boost, several minutes may be all he needs to get the job done and completely outmatch his opponent with a well-placed Kamehameha Wave.

But the trick in being successful as a One-Punch Man is that one has to be able to land that single punch. With Ultra Instinct, master or not, Goku could evade all of Saitama's attacks leaving his prodigious, signature ability completely useless. Combine that with the already vast array of abilities that Goku has at his disposal after a life (or three) of martial arts training, and Saitama could quickly find himself in over his head. A battle between Goku and Saitama would truly be a clash of the titans as the two anime heroes bring forth their supreme combat prowess in a crossover confrontation. While Goku may be vulnerable to the unassuming superhero's mighty blow, this vulnerability might become a moot point as he continues to become a defensive powerhouse that even Saitama can't touch in a hypothetical showdown.

By Gregory Segal Published Mar 19, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the Attack on Titan anime edges nearer to its finale, many fans have been wondering who the father of Historia\u2019s baby is. So far, she has hardly been seen throughout Season 4 which has left many to speculate as to what impact her child might have on the story and how Historia\u2019s arc will conclude. Over the course of the last few months, two factions have developed within the fandom with each supporting a different theory about the nature of Historia\u2019s relationship. One group believes that the origin of this child has already been confirmed, being the farmer character, while others have hypothesized that Eren Jaeger is in fact Historia\u2019s true partner.  RELATED: This Woefully Underappreciated Series May Still Be the Best Anime About Androids Why is Historia Pregnant?                   Within Episode 69, \u201cA Sound Argument\u201d, viewers are informed that two years ago, with the help of Zeke Jaeger and the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers, Paradis Island was connected with its old ally - the nation of Hizuru. This country's envoy, Kiyomi Azumabito, met with Paradis\u2019 leaders in an effort to begin negotiations on their relationship. While Azumabito initially stated that her desire to visit stemmed from wanting to meet Mikasa, who is revealed to be related to the long-lost child of their nation's shogunate. It is later assumed that this was just used as a pretext to ask for resources from Paradis. In return, Hizuru will offer their support to initiate Zeke\u2019s three-point plan to protect Paradis. The first part of this arrangement was for Paradis to test run the Rumbling in order to show the world a small fragment of their power, to frighten the citizens of the world, and establish control over them. Following this, Hizuru would offer its cooperation to strengthen the island\u2019s military, so that the threat of the Rumbling was no longer necessary. Lastly, Azumabito outlined that the founding Titan and a Titan of royal blood have to be passed down. On this third and final point, Azumabito clarified that Zeke will pass on the Beast Titan to someone of royal blood and that, until their 13-year term ends, they must bear as many children as possible. Since Historia is the only known person to have royal blood, who has not already inherited a Titan, the burden of this duty is placed on her alone. Historia recognized that if Paradis was to be protected that she must be the one to make this sacrifice. Consequently, she agreed to take on the Beast Titan and begin baring children. RELATED: Most Demon Slayers Have Crows \u2013 So Why Did Zenitsu Get a Sparrow? Is the Farmer the Father of Historia\u2019s Child?                   Shortly after this scene, Historia was shown in a rocking chair and is highly pregnant, insinuating that this is months after the negotiations have taken place. The only person that is with her is a young man, wearing indistinctive clothing, who requests that Historia come back into the house as she\u2019s got to take care of her body. Later, several officers of the Military Police could be seen discussing Historia\u2019s pregnancy. Roeg, a high-ranking officer, spoke negatively about Historia calling her a \u2018low-bred girl who is Queen in name only\u201d. While this comment can be perceived to simply demonstrate this character's opinion of Historia, it is seemingly more a reflection on her chosen partner who he disapproved of because of his poor background. Nile Dawk explained the nature of Historia\u2019s relationship with this man. Historia\u00a0grew up in the same area as the farmer. Initially, he would bully her by throwing rocks to gain her attention, however, he would later attempt to redeem himself by offering his support at the orphanage Historia opened. It is implied that this act of kindness was what led to their relationship and the love between them. Throughout this conversation, Dawk is adamant that it was Historia\u2019s choice to start this relationship and that the military has done a background check on this man to make sure that he isn\u2019t \u201canyone\u2019s lackey\u201d. This suggested that the story Dawk is telling has been verified through several sources and isn\u2019t simply a recent cover-up. RELATED: Tribe Nine Reveals a Connection to One of Danganronpa's Most Powerful Themes Is Eren the Father of Historia\u2019s Child?                  However, many fans have not been satisfied with this explanation as the farmer has never been seen or discussed outside of this episode. It seems strange that such a significant event, pertaining to one of AoT\u2019s main characters, is so ordinary and underwhelming. This has led people to speculate that there is much more beneath the surface than meets the eye. The first point of contention that people have with the Farmer being the father of the child is related to Historia\u2019s expression upon seeing her newly found partner. Historia was completely stoic and almost seemed to be in a state of depression while staying at the ranch. This isn\u2019t what one would typically expect to see from a mother-to-be who is in a happy and loving relationship. As such, some fans have hypothesized that Historia might not be with this man and that the story Dawk told members of Paradis\u2019 military about their relationship is partly untrue. It is plausible that the farmer was simply acting as a decoy in an effort to protect Historia, Eren, and their child. If either Paradis\u2019 or a foreign power's military were to discover that Eren was the father, then they would likely attempt to capture Historia and hold her ransom to prevent Eren from initiating his plan. This would explain the couple\u2019s lack of chemistry and why the two have not married. While it may initially appear difficult to reason why the farmer might take part in this conspiracy, the argument for him doing so may be contained within Dawk\u2019s story. Rather than being with Historia because he loves her, the farmer is instead doing so simply for his own redemption. By protecting Historia in her greatest moment of need, the bullying that he inflicted during her childhood will be forgiven. RELATED: My Hero Academia Reveals Why Toga Might Be Deku's Deadliest Enemy Another factor that has led fans to believe Eren is the father is the timeline between his mission to Marley and the start of Historia\u2019s pregnancy. Eren would leave for Marley shortly after Historia got pregnant, and 10 months later she would give birth during Eren\u2019s rumbling. While this could just be a coincidence, many have argued that it is anything but. Lastly, in the manga, it is revealed that Floch is not the only person to be aware of Eren\u2019s real plan and that Historia had prior knowledge of it as well. This might mean that having a baby was part of Eren\u2019s overarching scheme to protect Paradis and revive it to its former glory. While Floch\u2019s part in Eren\u2019s operation has been made clear, Historia\u2019s has not. If Eren was to risk telling Historia about his plan, then it makes sense that this would have been for a good reason. Fans have suggested that this demonstrates the closeness of their relationship, particularly since Eren couldn\u2019t even tell Armin and Mikasa about his goal to initiate the Rumbling. RELATED: Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends: Who (or What) Exactly Is Nyanko-Sensei? Who is the Real Father of Historia\u2019s Child?                   While this theory is certainly interesting and has many compelling ideas, it is largely based on a number of assumptions. It is understandable that fans, considering Hajime Isayama's consistent use of big reveals, believe that Historia\u2019s child is part of a bigger purpose within the plot. However, it might just be the case that Historia\u2019s relationships and overall arc have ended in a more simple fashion than many would have expected. Although the timing of Historia\u2019s pregnancy, in relation to Eren\u2019s departure from Paradis is strange, it too would be odd for Eren to conceive a child with Historia as part of his plan. After all, Eren was enraged that she would be used as a vessel for the political purposes of Hizuru. To then devise his own scheme, where Historia would be used in the process, would be highly hypocritical. Ultimately, the simplest solution to this problem is likely the answer. What we have been told and seen, within both the manga and the show, are likely correct. Historia\u2019s relationship, like most in the real world, is both unextraordinary and complicated. Whether Historia is in love with the farmer or simply with him out of self-preservation (so that she can buy more time and not have to inherit the Beast Titan) is likely the question that should be asked, rather than if Eren is the father.

Nile Dawk explained the nature of Historia\u2019s relationship with this man. Historia\u00a0grew up in the same area as the farmer. Initially, he would bully her by throwing rocks to gain her attention, however, he would later attempt to redeem himself by offering his support at the orphanage Historia opened. It is implied that this act of kindness was what led to their relationship and the love between them. Throughout this conversation, Dawk is adamant that it was Historia\u2019s choice to start this relationship and that the military has done a background check on this man to make sure that he isn\u2019t \u201canyone\u2019s lackey\u201d. This suggested that the story Dawk is telling has been verified through several sources and isn\u2019t simply a recent cover-up. RELATED: Tribe Nine Reveals a Connection to One of Danganronpa's Most Powerful Themes Is Eren the Father of Historia\u2019s Child?                  However, many fans have not been satisfied with this explanation as the farmer has never been seen or discussed outside of this episode. It seems strange that such a significant event, pertaining to one of AoT\u2019s main characters, is so ordinary and underwhelming. This has led people to speculate that there is much more beneath the surface than meets the eye. The first point of contention that people have with the Farmer being the father of the child is related to Historia\u2019s expression upon seeing her newly found partner. Historia was completely stoic and almost seemed to be in a state of depression while staying at the ranch. This isn\u2019t what one would typically expect to see from a mother-to-be who is in a happy and loving relationship. As such, some fans have hypothesized that Historia might not be with this man and that the story Dawk told members of Paradis\u2019 military about their relationship is partly untrue. It is plausible that the farmer was simply acting as a decoy in an effort to protect Historia, Eren, and their child. If either Paradis\u2019 or a foreign power's military were to discover that Eren was the father, then they would likely attempt to capture Historia and hold her ransom to prevent Eren from initiating his plan. This would explain the couple\u2019s lack of chemistry and why the two have not married. While it may initially appear difficult to reason why the farmer might take part in this conspiracy, the argument for him doing so may be contained within Dawk\u2019s story. Rather than being with Historia because he loves her, the farmer is instead doing so simply for his own redemption. By protecting Historia in her greatest moment of need, the bullying that he inflicted during her childhood will be forgiven. RELATED: My Hero Academia Reveals Why Toga Might Be Deku's Deadliest Enemy Another factor that has led fans to believe Eren is the father is the timeline between his mission to Marley and the start of Historia\u2019s pregnancy. Eren would leave for Marley shortly after Historia got pregnant, and 10 months later she would give birth during Eren\u2019s rumbling. While this could just be a coincidence, many have argued that it is anything but. Lastly, in the manga, it is revealed that Floch is not the only person to be aware of Eren\u2019s real plan and that Historia had prior knowledge of it as well. This might mean that having a baby was part of Eren\u2019s overarching scheme to protect Paradis and revive it to its former glory. While Floch\u2019s part in Eren\u2019s operation has been made clear, Historia\u2019s has not. If Eren was to risk telling Historia about his plan, then it makes sense that this would have been for a good reason. Fans have suggested that this demonstrates the closeness of their relationship, particularly since Eren couldn\u2019t even tell Armin and Mikasa about his goal to initiate the Rumbling. RELATED: Natsume\u2019s Book of Friends: Who (or What) Exactly Is Nyanko-Sensei? Who is the Real Father of Historia\u2019s Child?                   While this theory is certainly interesting and has many compelling ideas, it is largely based on a number of assumptions. It is understandable that fans, considering Hajime Isayama's consistent use of big reveals, believe that Historia\u2019s child is part of a bigger purpose within the plot. However, it might just be the case that Historia\u2019s relationships and overall arc have ended in a more simple fashion than many would have expected. Although the timing of Historia\u2019s pregnancy, in relation to Eren\u2019s departure from Paradis is strange, it too would be odd for Eren to conceive a child with Historia as part of his plan. After all, Eren was enraged that she would be used as a vessel for the political purposes of Hizuru. To then devise his own scheme, where Historia would be used in the process, would be highly hypocritical. Ultimately, the simplest solution to this problem is likely the answer. What we have been told and seen, within both the manga and the show, are likely correct. Historia\u2019s relationship, like most in the real world, is both unextraordinary and complicated. Whether Historia is in love with the farmer or simply with him out of self-preservation (so that she can buy more time and not have to inherit the Beast Titan) is likely the question that should be asked, rather than if Eren is the father.

By Christian Markle Published Mar 25, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Episode 86, \"Retrospective,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu, and Crunchyroll. In the latest episode of\u00a0Attack on Titan, Keith Shadis and Theo Magath sacrificed themselves to blow up the only ship that the Jaegerists could use to chase and obliterate\u00a0the resistance. Magath, during his final chat with Shadis, told the Eldian commander\u00a0that his\u00a0death is going to be\u00a0remembered as a heroic act that saved the world. However, such a scenario is highly unlikely. The anti-Eren resistance's peaceful plan went down the drain the moment Floch realized their true intention. A bloodbath ensued with the Azubimoto's flying boat at stake. During that time, Keith Shadis, the former instructor of Paradis Island's Cadet Corps, arrived and pointed out the ship that the Jaegerists stole from Marley. If left undamaged, it could easily catch up and destroy the flying boat they were trying to hijack.\u00a0The unlikely duo decided to infiltrate the ship\u00a0and sink it.  RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan Season 4's Most Tormented Character Isn't Eren                  The two veteran soldiers looked back at their lives, with\u00a0both of them concluding to\u00a0have lived\u00a0a life filled with more regrets than achievements. Both of them deeply regretted a great deal of their past.\u00a0When Shadis revealed his motivation for his suicidal bid being \"looking for a time to die,\" Magath consoled him by stating that the Eldian instructor will be a hero who saved the world. Shadis returned the sentiment, and only then did the two veterans exchange names. The next scene showed Magath pulling the trigger, which subsequently detonated the ship's supply of gunpowder. Even though the duo's final mission\u00a0is\u00a0indeed heroic and saved the resistance's main mission from certain doom, it is highly likely that Shadis' death has lost all of its chances\u00a0of\u00a0being known.\u00a0Keith Shadis' appearance, though much appreciated,\u00a0is unprecedented. Even though he killed his fair of Jaegerists to assist his former students, it is highly likely that only Magath is aware of his presence during this particular battle. Even if a few Jaegerists saw him on site, Magath and a few Jaegerists were the\u00a0only\u00a0ones who knew how the Eldian instruction met his demise. Unfortunately, all of them have died during the explosion. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Falco Debuts the New Jaw Titan - and It's a Game-Changer                  The resulting explosion was strong enough to blast through the ship's sides, and\u00a0there's a good chance\u00a0that the duo's bodies have already been blown to smithereens. Without any trace of his presence, the world will only be mourning the heroic death of Theo Magath. Even though Magath\u00a0proclaimed Shadis as one of the heroes who saved the world, Keith Shadis' death is already\u00a0written off before it's been etched in the annals of history. Theo Magath and Keith Shadis' heroic sacrifice allowed\u00a0the small resistance to push forward. While the group is mourning the Marleyan commander's demise, they are completely unaware of the Eldian instructor's contributions to the operation. It is also highly likely that it will remain that way as only ash remains of Shadis' corpse. Worst of all, Keith Shadis is not necessarily an impactful character.

By Christian Markle Published Mar 25, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Episode 86, \"Retrospective,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu, and Crunchyroll. In the latest episode of\u00a0Attack on Titan, Keith Shadis and Theo Magath sacrificed themselves to blow up the only ship that the Jaegerists could use to chase and obliterate\u00a0the resistance. Magath, during his final chat with Shadis, told the Eldian commander\u00a0that his\u00a0death is going to be\u00a0remembered as a heroic act that saved the world. However, such a scenario is highly unlikely. The anti-Eren resistance's peaceful plan went down the drain the moment Floch realized their true intention. A bloodbath ensued with the Azubimoto's flying boat at stake. During that time, Keith Shadis, the former instructor of Paradis Island's Cadet Corps, arrived and pointed out the ship that the Jaegerists stole from Marley. If left undamaged, it could easily catch up and destroy the flying boat they were trying to hijack.\u00a0The unlikely duo decided to infiltrate the ship\u00a0and sink it.  RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan Season 4's Most Tormented Character Isn't Eren                  The two veteran soldiers looked back at their lives, with\u00a0both of them concluding to\u00a0have lived\u00a0a life filled with more regrets than achievements. Both of them deeply regretted a great deal of their past.\u00a0When Shadis revealed his motivation for his suicidal bid being \"looking for a time to die,\" Magath consoled him by stating that the Eldian instructor will be a hero who saved the world. Shadis returned the sentiment, and only then did the two veterans exchange names. The next scene showed Magath pulling the trigger, which subsequently detonated the ship's supply of gunpowder. Even though the duo's final mission\u00a0is\u00a0indeed heroic and saved the resistance's main mission from certain doom, it is highly likely that Shadis' death has lost all of its chances\u00a0of\u00a0being known.\u00a0Keith Shadis' appearance, though much appreciated,\u00a0is unprecedented. Even though he killed his fair of Jaegerists to assist his former students, it is highly likely that only Magath is aware of his presence during this particular battle. Even if a few Jaegerists saw him on site, Magath and a few Jaegerists were the\u00a0only\u00a0ones who knew how the Eldian instruction met his demise. Unfortunately, all of them have died during the explosion. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Falco Debuts the New Jaw Titan - and It's a Game-Changer                  The resulting explosion was strong enough to blast through the ship's sides, and\u00a0there's a good chance\u00a0that the duo's bodies have already been blown to smithereens. Without any trace of his presence, the world will only be mourning the heroic death of Theo Magath. Even though Magath\u00a0proclaimed Shadis as one of the heroes who saved the world, Keith Shadis' death is already\u00a0written off before it's been etched in the annals of history. Theo Magath and Keith Shadis' heroic sacrifice allowed\u00a0the small resistance to push forward. While the group is mourning the Marleyan commander's demise, they are completely unaware of the Eldian instructor's contributions to the operation. It is also highly likely that it will remain that way as only ash remains of Shadis' corpse. Worst of all, Keith Shadis is not necessarily an impactful character. The majority of\u00a0Attack on Titan fans\u00a0will also probably forget of his end\u00a0as the anime features more\u00a0dramatic scenes including the main cast.

One of the best recent developments in Tower of God is the attention paid to supporting\u00a0characters and their backstories. Every story not only provides more detail to the overall sense of the fantasy world, but also gives readers some wonderfully complex characters that truly makes the manhwa an epic tale. That's especially true for the latest mini-arc, \u201cA Dog and Cat,\" which spans four chapters, and tells the story of the leader of the Canine Clan Baylord Wangwang and Lo Po Bia Yasratcha. Closely following the structure and characteristics of a Shakespearian tragedy, it's one of the best character backstories to date in Tower of God.  To simplify the story, Wangwang and Yasratcha are creations of the Workshop that wanted to experiment with human/beast hybrids, or beastkins. They both survived the experiments, and the gladiator-style tournaments, and made it onto the Tower as Regulars. During their journey up the Tower, they became partners and friends. Yasratcha\u2019s freedom-loving nature is in stark contrast to Wangwang\u2019s obedient instincts, but they made a good pair, with Wangwang doing most of the work as a dog would, and Yasratcha doing whatever he wants, just like a cat. RELATED:\u00a0A New Shojo Series Adds LGBTQ+ Representation to Classic Shakespeare                  After they both became Rankers, the Lo Po Bia Family Head, Traumerei, took them in as pets. Wangwang has been seeking a master all of his life, so he was happy to be kept in a cage, but Yasratcha didn't understand why someone as powerful as Wangwang would ever settle for a life of captivity and slavery. He began plotting for a way to free Wangwang from Lo Po Bia and back to adventuring. Eventually, Wangwang met Yama\u2019s mother, Nennen, fell in love, and had his children. Yasratcha used his family as bait to make it seem that Wangwang was betraying Traumerei, who killed Nennen after she admitted to her escape plans. Wangwang, who was still loyal to Traumerei, was heartbroken by the loss of his wife and his master\u2019s trust, asked to be killed in exchange for his children\u2019s lives. Wangwang and Yasratcha are both tragic characters. Wangwang is the classic tragic hero, who is righteous, kind and charismatic, but suffers from the fatal flaw of needing to follow a master who cares very little about him. While he was extremely loyal, almost to a fault, he was also, ironically, blessed (or cursed) with the Fangs of the Wild Beast, which allowed him be independent from all orders, including from Traumerei, and create his own clan. That irony ultimately led to his downfall, because he had grown strong enough to have his own clan, yet he desperately wanted his master\u2019s approval. But these are opposing wishes, and in the end, he cannot have everything. RELATED:\u00a0Tower of God: Who Is Enryu - and How Strong Is He? Yasratcha is more complex, but equally tragic; his longing for freedom is innate, but he probably loves Wangwang as much as he loves freedom, if not more. Because he is willing to become Traumerei\u2019s pet just to have an opportunity to take Wangwang away from him some day. Even though he says he can't understand why Wangwang would be willing to subject himself to being controlled by the master, he too, subjected himself to a life as a domesticated pet for Wangwang. But he still lost Wangwang, not to their master, but to his own schemes, even having to kill him with his own hands.                  There is no doubt that Yasratcha is the villain of this story; his selfishness\u00a0destroyed the Baylord family. But his tragedy is much more enduring and agonizing. There is nothing more painful for him than to realize his actions took away his love and happiness, and having to live with this guilt for the rest of his life. It's no wonder he continued to manipulate others using their own selfishness and desires, because he needs to prove he was right to convince Wangwang to leave. Because people can\u2019t have it all, they always have to make a choice to give up something, and it is exactly what he did to his lieutenants, Haratcha and Diel. RELATED:\u00a0Tower of God Chapter 519: Has [SPOILER] Really Been Killed? Wangwang invokes a Shakespearean\u00a0hero like Othello, who is incredibly gifted, but is easily deceived by people he trusts, partly due to his blind devotions. On the other hand, Yasratcha\u2019s obsession is akin to someone like Hamlet, whose single-mindedness led to tragedies all around him, consequences be damned. They are both victims of fate or instincts, as Yasratcha commented, because their fundamental traits directly caused their tragedies. Wangwang will eventually fail one way or another because he follows a brutal and ruthless master. And Yasratcha will never be able to have Wangwang because he can never fulfill Wangwang\u2019s desire to follow a master.                  This story also gives Lo Po Bia Traumerei some much needed character background and complexity, though what we found out is great news for our heroes down the line. Because Traumerei is clearly not a good person, he is cruel, egotistical and quite reckless. He sees everyone as his plaything and doesn\u2019t seem to care about anyone or anything. But he is easily angered by the thought of being betrayed, which made him lose his only truly loyal servant Wangwang. While these are fitting traits for a Family Head, it does not bode well for Bam if and when he eventually faces off with him.

He began plotting for a way to free Wangwang from Lo Po Bia and back to adventuring. Eventually, Wangwang met Yama\u2019s mother, Nennen, fell in love, and had his children. Yasratcha used his family as bait to make it seem that Wangwang was betraying Traumerei, who killed Nennen after she admitted to her escape plans. Wangwang, who was still loyal to Traumerei, was heartbroken by the loss of his wife and his master\u2019s trust, asked to be killed in exchange for his children\u2019s lives. Wangwang and Yasratcha are both tragic characters. Wangwang is the classic tragic hero, who is righteous, kind and charismatic, but suffers from the fatal flaw of needing to follow a master who cares very little about him. While he was extremely loyal, almost to a fault, he was also, ironically, blessed (or cursed) with the Fangs of the Wild Beast, which allowed him be independent from all orders, including from Traumerei, and create his own clan. That irony ultimately led to his downfall, because he had grown strong enough to have his own clan, yet he desperately wanted his master\u2019s approval. But these are opposing wishes, and in the end, he cannot have everything. RELATED:\u00a0Tower of God: Who Is Enryu - and How Strong Is He? Yasratcha is more complex, but equally tragic; his longing for freedom is innate, but he probably loves Wangwang as much as he loves freedom, if not more. Because he is willing to become Traumerei\u2019s pet just to have an opportunity to take Wangwang away from him some day. Even though he says he can't understand why Wangwang would be willing to subject himself to being controlled by the master, he too, subjected himself to a life as a domesticated pet for Wangwang. But he still lost Wangwang, not to their master, but to his own schemes, even having to kill him with his own hands.                  There is no doubt that Yasratcha is the villain of this story; his selfishness\u00a0destroyed the Baylord family. But his tragedy is much more enduring and agonizing. There is nothing more painful for him than to realize his actions took away his love and happiness, and having to live with this guilt for the rest of his life. It's no wonder he continued to manipulate others using their own selfishness and desires, because he needs to prove he was right to convince Wangwang to leave. Because people can\u2019t have it all, they always have to make a choice to give up something, and it is exactly what he did to his lieutenants, Haratcha and Diel. RELATED:\u00a0Tower of God Chapter 519: Has [SPOILER] Really Been Killed? Wangwang invokes a Shakespearean\u00a0hero like Othello, who is incredibly gifted, but is easily deceived by people he trusts, partly due to his blind devotions. On the other hand, Yasratcha\u2019s obsession is akin to someone like Hamlet, whose single-mindedness led to tragedies all around him, consequences be damned. They are both victims of fate or instincts, as Yasratcha commented, because their fundamental traits directly caused their tragedies. Wangwang will eventually fail one way or another because he follows a brutal and ruthless master. And Yasratcha will never be able to have Wangwang because he can never fulfill Wangwang\u2019s desire to follow a master.                  This story also gives Lo Po Bia Traumerei some much needed character background and complexity, though what we found out is great news for our heroes down the line. Because Traumerei is clearly not a good person, he is cruel, egotistical and quite reckless. He sees everyone as his plaything and doesn\u2019t seem to care about anyone or anything. But he is easily angered by the thought of being betrayed, which made him lose his only truly loyal servant Wangwang. While these are fitting traits for a Family Head, it does not bode well for Bam if and when he eventually faces off with him.

Here\u2019s how that happened, and how old she really is.     By Marc York Published 11 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    In 2013,\u00a0the\u00a0Dragon Ball gave Trunks a new love interest in the form of Mai. However, in Dragon Ball Super, the two are shown having grown up together and developing a strong bond. That initially seems wholesome, but there's one thing fans can\u2019t help but ask about: Mai's actual age. In truth, Mai is an adult much older than Trunks; a wish on the Dragon Balls reverted Mai to a child around Trunks' age. But her actual age is a little more difficult to answer, especially considering how the timeline works in\u00a0Dragon Ball Super. Determining Mai's real age will require an understanding of\u00a0Dragon Ball's\u00a0timeline, and where Mai falls in it.  RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: King Kai's Wish Makes More Sense Censored                  Mai's first given age comes from Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. Before the events of the movie, the Pilaf Gang used the Dragon Balls to restore their youth, but they were made too young and turned into children.\u00a0Despite that, when asked about her age, Mai thoughtlessly answers \"41 in March.\" Because Battle of the Gods takes place in 778, roughly four years after the Buu Saga (Age 774), Mai's presumed year of birth is 737. What's peculiar about\u00a0Mai's given age is that it's around\u00a0the same age as Goku. At this point in Dragon Ball\u00a0continuity, Goku was presumed to have also been born in Age 737. Despite that, by the time they meet in Age 749, Goku looks no older than 12, which adds up, while Mai looks no younger than the mid-teen Bulma. It's possible Mai lied about her age, and she's actually a little older than she cares to admit. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z's Trunks Saga Would've Been Better Without Frieza Dragon Ball Super makes\u00a0this question even harder to answer. Unlike the movie, this series\u00a0begins mere months after the Buu Saga.\u00a0While Mai's comment about being in her forties doesn't make it into the anime, if it holds true at this point, then her being older than Goku (who should still only be 37 in Age 774) is more believable. In any case, it's safe to assume that, chronologically, Mai is either in her late thirties or early forties\u00a0by this point. As for Mai's age as a \"child,\" she's probably close to Trunks', if not a little older.  When she's introduced at this age, she's shown to be a little taller than the boy. That changes by Future Trunks' time, but that's more likely due to the difference in how boys and girls develop in regard to height. If this is true, then Mai should be at least 12 by Age 778. This is further backed by a bonus chapter of the\u00a0DBS\u00a0manga from 2016. In this chapter, the Pilaf Gang is shown wishing to be younger around the time Trunks was a baby. They themselves are reverted to babies by the wish. Assuming this part of the anime and manga continuity line up, it proves that Trunks and Mai are around the same age. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: The Fusion Saga's Most Shocking Plot Twists                  It's worth noting that, despite their physical ages, neither Trunks nor Mai look any older, despite entire years going by. Trunks has looked like he was 8 since Age 774. This makes sense in that year since he actually\u00a0was 8 at the time. However, by the time of the Tournament of Power (Age 780), he should be at least 14. Even\u00a0History of Trunks, which also took place in Age 780, knew to make Future Trunks look older based on his apparent age. Regardless, Trunks and Mai remain cute and marketable for\u00a0DBS. Whatever the cause of Trunks and Mai's lasting youth, they should be assumed to be around the same age following Mai's regression. She starts off in what should be her early forties but regresses to around 8-12 years old due to the wish on the Dragon Balls. This holds true whether Trunks and Mai met in Age 774 or Age 778. This doesn't explain why they still look\u00a08 to 12 years old by Age 780, but that's how it is. At the very least,\u00a0Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero\u00a0seems like it will finally make these two look as old as they should be.

However, in Dragon Ball Super, the two are shown having grown up together and developing a strong bond. That initially seems wholesome, but there's one thing fans can\u2019t help but ask about: Mai's actual age. In truth, Mai is an adult much older than Trunks; a wish on the Dragon Balls reverted Mai to a child around Trunks' age. But her actual age is a little more difficult to answer, especially considering how the timeline works in\u00a0Dragon Ball Super. Determining Mai's real age will require an understanding of\u00a0Dragon Ball's\u00a0timeline, and where Mai falls in it.  RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: King Kai's Wish Makes More Sense Censored                  Mai's first given age comes from Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. Before the events of the movie, the Pilaf Gang used the Dragon Balls to restore their youth, but they were made too young and turned into children.\u00a0Despite that, when asked about her age, Mai thoughtlessly answers \"41 in March.\" Because Battle of the Gods takes place in 778, roughly four years after the Buu Saga (Age 774), Mai's presumed year of birth is 737. What's peculiar about\u00a0Mai's given age is that it's around\u00a0the same age as Goku. At this point in Dragon Ball\u00a0continuity, Goku was presumed to have also been born in Age 737. Despite that, by the time they meet in Age 749, Goku looks no older than 12, which adds up, while Mai looks no younger than the mid-teen Bulma. It's possible Mai lied about her age, and she's actually a little older than she cares to admit. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z's Trunks Saga Would've Been Better Without Frieza Dragon Ball Super makes\u00a0this question even harder to answer. Unlike the movie, this series\u00a0begins mere months after the Buu Saga.\u00a0While Mai's comment about being in her forties doesn't make it into the anime, if it holds true at this point, then her being older than Goku (who should still only be 37 in Age 774) is more believable. In any case, it's safe to assume that, chronologically, Mai is either in her late thirties or early forties\u00a0by this point. As for Mai's age as a \"child,\" she's probably close to Trunks', if not a little older.  When she's introduced at this age, she's shown to be a little taller than the boy. That changes by Future Trunks' time, but that's more likely due to the difference in how boys and girls develop in regard to height. If this is true, then Mai should be at least 12 by Age 778. This is further backed by a bonus chapter of the\u00a0DBS\u00a0manga from 2016. In this chapter, the Pilaf Gang is shown wishing to be younger around the time Trunks was a baby. They themselves are reverted to babies by the wish. Assuming this part of the anime and manga continuity line up, it proves that Trunks and Mai are around the same age. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Z: The Fusion Saga's Most Shocking Plot Twists                  It's worth noting that, despite their physical ages, neither Trunks nor Mai look any older, despite entire years going by. Trunks has looked like he was 8 since Age 774. This makes sense in that year since he actually\u00a0was 8 at the time. However, by the time of the Tournament of Power (Age 780), he should be at least 14. Even\u00a0History of Trunks, which also took place in Age 780, knew to make Future Trunks look older based on his apparent age. Regardless, Trunks and Mai remain cute and marketable for\u00a0DBS. Whatever the cause of Trunks and Mai's lasting youth, they should be assumed to be around the same age following Mai's regression. She starts off in what should be her early forties but regresses to around 8-12 years old due to the wish on the Dragon Balls. This holds true whether Trunks and Mai met in Age 774 or Age 778. This doesn't explain why they still look\u00a08 to 12 years old by Age 780, but that's how it is. At the very least,\u00a0Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero\u00a0seems like it will finally make these two look as old as they should be.

By Daniel McMahon Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The 2003 series of Fullmetal Alchemist is drastically different from the 2009 manga faithful adaption Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. These differences resulted largely because the manga was still ongoing at the time of the 2003 series, resulting in an anime-original storyline for the latter half of the plot. One major deviation is the role of Ishval and how neither adaptation remained entirely faithful to the source material. This resulted in two unique adaptations with different outcomes for the Ishvalan people. RELATED: How Tall Is Fullmetal Alchemist's Edward Elric - and How Did He Grow Taller?  The Ishvalan Civil War                  In Fullmetal Alchemist, the Ishvalan Civil War was started when an elite team of Amestrian soldiers raided an Ishvalan temple and slaughtered the monks inside. The Ishvalans began to riot and King Bradley used Eastern Soldiers to forcefully suppress them and raise tensions. The homunculi\u2019s goal in starting the Civil War in Brotherhood is different than in the original. In the 2003 anime, the homunculi\u2019s goal was to create enough despair that someone would feel compelled to create and use a Philosopher\u2019s Stone. In Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, the Civil War started when Envy (disguised as an Amestrian soldier) shot and killed a child. The Ishvalans retaliated, and it was not long before the war broke out. Thanks in part to the familiar terrain, supply of weapons from neighboring countries, and guerilla tactics the Ishvalans managed to fight the Amestrian soldiers to what seemed like a stalemate. The war reached its climax with King Bradley\u2019s issuance of Order 3066 which drafted all state alchemists to the front lines of the war. With the overwhelming power of the state alchemists, the Ishvalans were slaughtered and forced into refuge across the country. Similar to the homunculi\u2019s goals in the 2003 series, the Ishvalan Civil War was started by the homunculi to cause as much death as possible. The difference between Brotherhood and the manga is revealed to be that the massacre served as one of the ten intersecting points creating the nationwide transmutation circle. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist: Why Nina Tucker's Tragic Story Still Resonates So Strongly Depictions of Brutality                  One of the biggest and most noticeable differences between Ishvalans in FMA and FMAB is how much they have suffered. In the manga and the 2003 series, the Ishvalan Civil War and its brutality were highlighted. This added much-needed nuanced themes of distrusting the military and of questioning orders. One such example was\u00a0Brotherhood\u2019s decision to retcon Mustang\u2019s decision to follow the unethical order to kill the Rockbells. This retcon was\u00a0detrimental\u00a0as the event provided a great deal of insight into Mustang\u2019s distrust of his superiors. Another example of an event missing from Brotherhood was the day in which Brigadier General Basque Grand ordered the use of Philosopher\u2019s Stones in the Ishvalan Civil War. This resulted in the state alchemists almost entirely decimating the population of Ishval in a single day. Brotherhood also lacked the disturbing scenes of the homunculi using Ishvalans in human experimentation. In the 2003 series, Ed is shocked to learn that the military has been using Ishvalans to create Philosopher\u2019s Stones. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Reveals New Images from Live-Action Sequel Movies Differences in Reparations                  Appearing in the manga and Brotherhood was Grand Cleric Lowe who was the leader of the Ishvalan faith. Lowe\u2019s final prophecy, \"God\u2019s wrath will smite you (Bradley) for your wickedness\" was fulfilled in the climax of the series when Bradley was momentarily blinded by the Sun\u2019s reflection off of his blade allowing for Scar to fatally wound him. As revealed by Ed\u2019s understanding of alchemy, the \"Sun\" is a representation of \"God\" and since Scar proclaimed himself as \"God\u2019s wrath,\" Lowe was correct in his final prophecy. Furthermore, at the conclusion of Fullmetal Alchemist, the Amestrians aided the Ishvalans in their return to Ishval and helped to rebuild their homes. Oddly enough, that was the full extent of reparations that is seen in the 2003 series and would be altered in Brotherhood. The finale of Brotherhood depicted a more action-oriented and foresighted approach to the situation. Roy Mustang, now the rank of Brigadier General, asked Major Miles to help him oversee the reconstruction of Ishval. Furthermore, Mustang proposed making Ishval an Eastern trading point to reinvigorate the local economy. To stimulate the Ishvalan economy into action, Mustang arranged the widespread cultivation of wheat and cotton to be owned and traded by Ishvalans.

Scar was then fatally shot by an Amestrian soldier while protecting Lust. Realizing he had no other choice, Scar used the last of his power to complete the city-wide transmutation circle and create a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse to save him. In the movie Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa it is revealed that both Lust and Scar's Earthen counterparts are alive and traveling as Roma. In Brotherhood, Scar managed to mortally wound King Bradley and survive the final battle. While recovering from his injuries, he accepted Major Miles' and General Armstrong's invitation to rebuild Ishval and restore its culture. His last seen appearance is in a photograph with grown-out hair and Major Miles still accompanying him in the Ishvalan restoration process. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist: Gluttony Was the 'Weakest' Homunculus for Good Reason Is Alchemy Taboo?                  In the 2003 series, Ishvalans make it repeatedly clear that alchemy goes against the teachings of Ishval. Since Ishvalans believe that only the earth god Ishvala should be able to \"breathe life\" into inanimate objects, alchemy is considered to be heretical. The implications of being found practicing alchemy are severe as well. Once an Ishvalan has been seen practicing alchemy, they are exiled and shunned from society. This taboo dates back to the 2003 anime-exclusive Ishvalan branch of alchemy called, \"Grand Arcanum.\" The last known user of the Grand Arcanum was the old Ishvalan exile seen in Fullmetal Alchemist (2003), Episode 36, \"The Sinner Within.\" The Ishvalan exile then taught the forbidden art to Scar\u2019s brother who used it to revive his love, accidentally creating Lust from the souls of the deceased Ishvalans. Whereas alchemy draws its power from the deceased souls of Earth passing through the Gate and live souls trapped in Philosopher\u2019s Stones, the Grand Arcanum draws its power from already deceased souls in the area. In Brotherhood, Ishvalans consider alchemy sinful\u00a0but they don't take action or exile anymore. The difference between constructive and destructive alchemy to Ishvalans is also noted in both series. The differences between the two series primarily stem from the need to diverge from the source material in the 2003 adaptation. Scar's fate, the brutality of the war, the taboo nature of alchemy, and the reparations afterward serve to give the two adaptations their own unique identities due to their differing portrayals.

By Daniel McMahon Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The 2003 series of Fullmetal Alchemist is drastically different from the 2009 manga faithful adaption Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. These differences resulted largely because the manga was still ongoing at the time of the 2003 series, resulting in an anime-original storyline for the latter half of the plot. One major deviation is the role of Ishval and how neither adaptation remained entirely faithful to the source material. This resulted in two unique adaptations with different outcomes for the Ishvalan people. RELATED: How Tall Is Fullmetal Alchemist's Edward Elric - and How Did He Grow Taller?  The Ishvalan Civil War                  In Fullmetal Alchemist, the Ishvalan Civil War was started when an elite team of Amestrian soldiers raided an Ishvalan temple and slaughtered the monks inside. The Ishvalans began to riot and King Bradley used Eastern Soldiers to forcefully suppress them and raise tensions. The homunculi\u2019s goal in starting the Civil War in Brotherhood is different than in the original. In the 2003 anime, the homunculi\u2019s goal was to create enough despair that someone would feel compelled to create and use a Philosopher\u2019s Stone. In Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, the Civil War started when Envy (disguised as an Amestrian soldier) shot and killed a child. The Ishvalans retaliated, and it was not long before the war broke out. Thanks in part to the familiar terrain, supply of weapons from neighboring countries, and guerilla tactics the Ishvalans managed to fight the Amestrian soldiers to what seemed like a stalemate. The war reached its climax with King Bradley\u2019s issuance of Order 3066 which drafted all state alchemists to the front lines of the war. With the overwhelming power of the state alchemists, the Ishvalans were slaughtered and forced into refuge across the country. Similar to the homunculi\u2019s goals in the 2003 series, the Ishvalan Civil War was started by the homunculi to cause as much death as possible. The difference between Brotherhood and the manga is revealed to be that the massacre served as one of the ten intersecting points creating the nationwide transmutation circle. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist: Why Nina Tucker's Tragic Story Still Resonates So Strongly Depictions of Brutality                  One of the biggest and most noticeable differences between Ishvalans in FMA and FMAB is how much they have suffered. In the manga and the 2003 series, the Ishvalan Civil War and its brutality were highlighted. This added much-needed nuanced themes of distrusting the military and of questioning orders. One such example was\u00a0Brotherhood\u2019s decision to retcon Mustang\u2019s decision to follow the unethical order to kill the Rockbells. This retcon was\u00a0detrimental\u00a0as the event provided a great deal of insight into Mustang\u2019s distrust of his superiors. Another example of an event missing from Brotherhood was the day in which Brigadier General Basque Grand ordered the use of Philosopher\u2019s Stones in the Ishvalan Civil War. This resulted in the state alchemists almost entirely decimating the population of Ishval in a single day. Brotherhood also lacked the disturbing scenes of the homunculi using Ishvalans in human experimentation. In the 2003 series, Ed is shocked to learn that the military has been using Ishvalans to create Philosopher\u2019s Stones. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Reveals New Images from Live-Action Sequel Movies Differences in Reparations                  Appearing in the manga and Brotherhood was Grand Cleric Lowe who was the leader of the Ishvalan faith. Lowe\u2019s final prophecy, \"God\u2019s wrath will smite you (Bradley) for your wickedness\" was fulfilled in the climax of the series when Bradley was momentarily blinded by the Sun\u2019s reflection off of his blade allowing for Scar to fatally wound him. As revealed by Ed\u2019s understanding of alchemy, the \"Sun\" is a representation of \"God\" and since Scar proclaimed himself as \"God\u2019s wrath,\" Lowe was correct in his final prophecy. Furthermore, at the conclusion of Fullmetal Alchemist, the Amestrians aided the Ishvalans in their return to Ishval and helped to rebuild their homes. Oddly enough, that was the full extent of reparations that is seen in the 2003 series and would be altered in Brotherhood. The finale of Brotherhood depicted a more action-oriented and foresighted approach to the situation. Roy Mustang, now the rank of Brigadier General, asked Major Miles to help him oversee the reconstruction of Ishval. Furthermore, Mustang proposed making Ishval an Eastern trading point to reinvigorate the local economy. To stimulate the Ishvalan economy into action, Mustang arranged the widespread cultivation of wheat and cotton to be owned and traded by Ishvalans. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer Scar's Fate                  In a final battle of the 2003 series against Alphonse and Scar, Kimblee used the last of his strength to transmute Alphonse into a living bomb. Scar was then fatally shot by an Amestrian soldier while protecting Lust. Realizing he had no other choice, Scar used the last of his power to complete the city-wide transmutation circle and create a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse to save him. In the movie Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa it is revealed that both Lust and Scar's Earthen counterparts are alive and traveling as Roma.

While recovering from his injuries, he accepted Major Miles' and General Armstrong's invitation to rebuild Ishval and restore its culture.

But don't let that fool you; many of them are well worth your time.     By Jonathon Greenall Published 7 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The titles of light novels are getting longer and longer. In fact, many use the title like a plot synopsis, with the name telling readers everything they need to know about the premise at a glance. However, that can mean many light novels sound absolutely ludicrous, with almost paragraph-long titles. However, if you want to enjoy a series with a super-long and hard-to-say title, here are five of the best options currently available. Related:\u00a0Realist Hero: How to Get Started With the Anime and Light Novels WorldEnd: What Do You Do at the End of the World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us?                  WorldEnd: What Do You Do at the End of the World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us? is frequently shortened to WorldEnd. Debuting in 2014, the series written by Akira Kareno and illustrated by Ue is set in a world where humans were almost wiped out by mysterious monsters more than 500 years earlier. Now, those who survived live on floating islands protected by the Leprechauns, girls who can wield special weapons to repel the monsters.  However, when Willem, a man who lost everything 500 years ago, wakes up, he befriends some of the girls, and together they try to navigate this strange world, and the emotional cost of warfare. Despite the odd name, WorldEnd is a surprisingly thoughtful and stirring deconstruction of the nature of heroism and the nature of combat in a world wracked by war, making it a must-read. It's available from Yen Press. Related:\u00a0How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?                  Written by Fujino \u014cmori and illustrated by Suzuhito Yasuda, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? has generated a massive fandom since its 2013 debut. The series is set in the city of Orario, whose gods, keen to experience hardship, limit their powers. However, each one maintains a group of adventurers and support staff called a Familia, and each Familia spends its time exploring the Dungeon that lies beneath the city. The series follows young Bell Cranel, an adventurer who's the sole member of the Hestia Familia. Bell aims to become as strong as the legendary Ais Wallenstein. However, he must work hard to achieve this goal while navigating romance and other general life problems. The series is a fun romp with gripping characters and a nice blend of genres. The series is available from Yen Press.

However, rather than coming back as something powerful, the knight returns as a cat-like baby Behemoth monster. The knight quickly finds how weak he is when he nearly dies in combat. However, before he can perish a second time, an elf-girl named Aria saves him and nurses him back to health. To repay her kindness, the knight opts to protect Aria in any way he can. The fun twist on the usual fantasy setup and the engaging core relationship make this series stand out. It's available from Yen Press.

The series follows Gideon Ragnason, who was part of a hero's adventuring party. However, when Ares, the party's second-in-command, gets him exiled from the party, Gideon has to find something else to do. Hoping for a quiet and easy life, Gideon moves to a rural town and changes his name to Red. He then opens a small apothecary shop, which soon becomes a hit with the locals. Alas, Gideon's plans to live in anonymity are soon shattered as someone from his old life tracks him down. Red then must deal with his past and the prospect of romance. A clever subversion of usual tropes, Banished from the Hero's Party features some excellent and memorable characters that will keep you enthralled. The series is available from Yen Press.

But don't let that fool you; many of them are well worth your time.     By Jonathon Greenall Published 7 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The titles of light novels are getting longer and longer. In fact, many use the title like a plot synopsis, with the name telling readers everything they need to know about the premise at a glance. However, that can mean many light novels sound absolutely ludicrous, with almost paragraph-long titles. However, if you want to enjoy a series with a super-long and hard-to-say title, here are five of the best options currently available.

WorldEnd: What Do You Do at the End of the World? Are You Busy? Will You Save Us? is frequently shortened to WorldEnd. Debuting in 2014, the series written by Akira Kareno and illustrated by Ue is set in a world where humans were almost wiped out by mysterious monsters more than 500 years earlier. Now, those who survived live on floating islands protected by the Leprechauns, girls who can wield special weapons to repel the monsters.  However, when Willem, a man who lost everything 500 years ago, wakes up, he befriends some of the girls, and together they try to navigate this strange world, and the emotional cost of warfare. Despite the odd name, WorldEnd is a surprisingly thoughtful and stirring deconstruction of the nature of heroism and the nature of combat in a world wracked by war, making it a must-read. It's available from Yen Press. Related:\u00a0How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?

However, each one maintains a group of adventurers and support staff called a Familia, and each Familia spends its time exploring the Dungeon that lies beneath the city. The series follows young Bell Cranel, an adventurer who's the sole member of the Hestia Familia. Bell aims to become as strong as the legendary Ais Wallenstein. However, he must work hard to achieve this goal while navigating romance and other general life problems. The series is a fun romp with gripping characters and a nice blend of genres. The series is available from Yen Press.

However, rather than coming back as something powerful, the knight returns as a cat-like baby Behemoth monster. The knight quickly finds how weak he is when he nearly dies in combat. However, before he can perish a second time, an elf-girl named Aria saves him and nurses him back to health. To repay her kindness, the knight opts to protect Aria in any way he can. The fun twist on the usual fantasy setup and the engaging core relationship make this series stand out. It's available from Yen Press.

However, when Ares, the party's second-in-command, gets him exiled from the party, Gideon has to find something else to do. Hoping for a quiet and easy life, Gideon moves to a rural town and changes his name to Red. He then opens a small apothecary shop, which soon becomes a hit with the locals. Alas, Gideon's plans to live in anonymity are soon shattered as someone from his old life tracks him down. Red then must deal with his past and the prospect of romance.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Numerous shonen anime have become huge hits over the years, especially as anime has had an international resurgence in global popularity. This has made it to where just about any action-adventure series could become a hit and be remembered in one way or another. At the same time, there have been a few shows that have slipped through the cracks of the mainstream, and sometimes not due to a lack of quality.  Tegami Bachi, or \u201cLetter Bee\u201d was one such series. Based on an unconventional Weekly Shonen Jump manga, this show was quite different from most traditional manga for the shonen demographic. Spawning two seasons and two OVAs, the tone, atmosphere and storytelling make it stand out among its brethren in a good way.  RELATED:\u00a0Acura's Web Series 'Chiaki's Journey' Is Perfect for a Full-Fledged Anime What is Tegami Bachi?                  Tegami Bachi began in 2006 as a Weekly Shonen Jump manga by Hiroyuki Asada. It was given an OVA special adaptation by Pierrot+ studio in 2008, one year before the first season of the true anime adaptation from the same company would begin airing. The show is incredibly unique not only in its setting and concepts, but also for just how \u201cun-shonen\u201d it is.  The setting of Tegami Bachi is the world of Amberground, which is kept in an endless loop of nighttime and illuminated only partially by an artificial sun. In this work, people\u2019s feelings and emotions are sent through letters, with the deliverers of these messages being called \u201cLetter Bees.\u201d Threatening the lives and livelihoods of these individuals are ravenous giant insects that feast upon the emotions contained within the heartfelt messages they carry.  The protagonist is Lag Seeing, a young boy who previously lost it all when his mother was taken away. Becoming a Letter Bee with Gauche Suede, Lag comes to idolize him, only for Gauche to go missing and lose his memory. When he\u2019s recovered, Gauche has no knowledge of his previous self and begins sympathizing with an anti-Letter Bee faction known as Reverse. While trying to restore the memory of his hero, Lag also searches with his friend Niche to find out the truth about what happened to his mother. RELATED:\u00a0What Is Kodomomuke \u2013 and What Are Some of Its Best Anime & Manga? What Made Tegami Bachi So Good?                  Tegami Bachi is classified as a steampunk series, but it doesn\u2019t feel steampunk in the traditional sense. From its physical world to its tone and atmosphere, Tegami Bachi\u00a0is incredibly unique in a way that\u2019s hard to define. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel like its contemporaries such as Naruto or One Piece, namely due to much of its action and extensive battle sequences/power-ups being absent.  There\u2019s also the protagonist and the character designs, which would almost feel more at home in a shojo-based anime. This sort of flowery Gothic vibe is similar to shows such as D. Gray-man, and fittingly, it contains all manner of subtly dark undertones and themes beneath its beautiful exterior. The animation is to this day absolutely gorgeous, even when compared to newer shonen titles such as Demon Slayer.  Speaking of designs and characters, Lag doesn\u2019t look or act like the hero of a shonen series whatsoever, and this only helps the series. While many shonen anime protagonists can have their thematic lineage traced back to Goku from the Dragon Ball series, Lag is something completely different. Soft featured, frail and in no way a fighter, he\u2019s about as far away from a battle anime protagonist as can be.  In fact, Gauche is the character who viewers would think is the protagonist, so flipping this and having the veritable crybaby be the real hero is definitely unexpected. Add in the themes of \u201cbugs eating the hearts and emotions of letters,\u201d and it\u2019s plain to see how distinctive the story of Tegami Bachi is from others of its kind.  Sadly, the series isn\u2019t really remembered now, despite how much it stands out from among its peers. This could have been because it aired right before the current resurgence of anime, especially in terms of shonen anime popularity. Nevertheless, Tegami Bachi can still be enjoyed now via both Crunchyroll and VRV. KEEP READING:\u00a0Mushishi: What Time Period Does the Anime Take Place In?

By Diane Darcy Published 6 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 11, \"By Hook or Crook,\" now streaming on Funimation. The reign of Prince Wein has been on a wild trajectory ever since he led his kingdom of Natra in two battles against the kingdom of Marden. Following Natra's defeat of Marden, the kingdom's royal family was betrayed and assassinated by its king's advisor Holonyeh, leaving the younger Princess Zenovia as the sole survivor. As the least experienced monarch in ruling a kingdom, Zenovia made a deal with Wein to merge the kingdoms of Marden and Natra.  The acquisition of Marden helped Natra acquire more valuable resources, although it also drew attention from the Earthworld Empire and especially the imperial Princess Lowellmina, Wein's childhood friend. Natra's acquisition of Marden also got the attention of the more bigoted western kingdoms of Cavarin, Soljest and Delunio, the latter of which owned and leased Marden land. Since the western kingdoms all subscribe to the Levetian religion, most of its monarchs and political leaders are also members of the Holy Elite. As such, they view Wein as a threat to their ruling structure and began to conspire against him. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Princess Lowa Returns With an Unexpected Twist                  The first western monarch who attempted to control Wein was King Ordalasse of Cavarin, who invited him to join the Holy Elite. Wein, of course, saw through the king's ruse and attempted to delay his membership during his interview with the Elite Caldmellia. The action that doomed Wein, however, was his impulsive murder of Ordalasse following his racist comments on the Flahm race, of which his best friend Ninym Ralei is a member. This action didn't go unnoticed by the western kingdoms and especially the Holy Elite, who have since changed their approach. In Episode 11 of The Genius Prince's Guide, it's revealed that the western kingdoms won't trade with the Earthworld Empire, which leads Wein to sell their goods as Natran products through Marden. This fraudulent exchange catches the attention of Delunio's prime minister Sirgis, who confronts Wein and Zenovia about their questionable trade practices. This catches Zenovia off guard, as she was not aware this was happening, but Wein dismisses Sirgis' claims. This naturally angers the Delunian prime minister, who promises Wein that he will face consequences for his actions. Wein takes Sirgis' threat with a grain of salt and travels to Soljest to form an alliance with King Gruyere instead. Wein and Ninym (once again disguised with black hair) are welcomed to the kingdom of Soljest with open arms by King Gruyere, who immediately invites them to a feast. At the dining hall, Wein meets Gruyere's daughter Princess Tolcheila, who introduces the Natran prince to all of Soljest's finest cuisine dishes, effectively preventing him from bringing up the subject of an alliance. For the remainder of his stay, Wein tries to strike up a conversation with Gruyere about an alliance but is avoided at every turn by the king. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Wein Answers Lowa\u2019s Marriage Proposal Amid Chaos                  The moment Gruyere makes for Wein to hear his proposal for an alliance, he is surprisingly kind to Ninym, who he is aware is actually Flahm and is not fooled by her change in hair color. Wein remains distrustful of Gruyere and anticipates an assassination plot against him, but Gruyere continues to prove him wrong and instead shares his more liberal political views. This catches Wein off guard; he did not expect this from a western monarch who subscribes to the oppressive Levetian religion. When he especially shares his belief that Flahm is an equal race of people worthy of the same rights and respect afforded to other races, this is enough to win Wein's immediate trust. When he especially accepts Wein's proposal of an alliance, it puts his mind at ease about Natra's future. Unbeknownst to Wein, he fell right into Gruyere's trap, which he does not become aware of until he returns to Natra. The moment he makes it back to his palace, he quickly learns that Delunio invaded Marden, which in turn caused Soljest to declare war against Natra. Wein then connects all the dots and figures out what really happened during his stay in Soljest. Prior to his arrival, Delunio's prime minister formed an alliance with King Gruyere to seize Marden over their void lease, but he is in fact targeting Natra. Gruyere then facilitated the prime minister's goals by playing to Wein's weaknesses to temporarily gain his trust and strike when he least expected it. With Natra about to go to war against a more powerful kingdom, Zenovia suggests reconciling with Delunio, which is a political ally of Soljest. She reasons that if Natra and Delunio enter a peace treaty, this will invalidate Soljest's declaration of war. She also wants to do her part to avoid another costly war, although Wein cooks up an idea to \"turn things upside down\" on both Delunio and Soljest. However, his plan may require backing from the more powerful Earthworld Empire and especially Princess Lowellmina, who is the only eastern monarch besides Wein who can successfully defeat the western kingdoms.

By Diane Darcy Published 6 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 11, \"By Hook or Crook,\" now streaming on Funimation. The reign of Prince Wein has been on a wild trajectory ever since he led his kingdom of Natra in two battles against the kingdom of Marden. Following Natra's defeat of Marden, the kingdom's royal family was betrayed and assassinated by its king's advisor Holonyeh, leaving the younger Princess Zenovia as the sole survivor. As the least experienced monarch in ruling a kingdom, Zenovia made a deal with Wein to merge the kingdoms of Marden and Natra.  The acquisition of Marden helped Natra acquire more valuable resources, although it also drew attention from the Earthworld Empire and especially the imperial Princess Lowellmina, Wein's childhood friend. Natra's acquisition of Marden also got the attention of the more bigoted western kingdoms of Cavarin, Soljest and Delunio, the latter of which owned and leased Marden land. Since the western kingdoms all subscribe to the Levetian religion, most of its monarchs and political leaders are also members of the Holy Elite. As such, they view Wein as a threat to their ruling structure and began to conspire against him. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Princess Lowa Returns With an Unexpected Twist                  The first western monarch who attempted to control Wein was King Ordalasse of Cavarin, who invited him to join the Holy Elite. Wein, of course, saw through the king's ruse and attempted to delay his membership during his interview with the Elite Caldmellia. The action that doomed Wein, however, was his impulsive murder of Ordalasse following his racist comments on the Flahm race, of which his best friend Ninym Ralei is a member. This action didn't go unnoticed by the western kingdoms and especially the Holy Elite, who have since changed their approach. In Episode 11 of The Genius Prince's Guide, it's revealed that the western kingdoms won't trade with the Earthworld Empire, which leads Wein to sell their goods as Natran products through Marden. This fraudulent exchange catches the attention of Delunio's prime minister Sirgis, who confronts Wein and Zenovia about their questionable trade practices. This catches Zenovia off guard, as she was not aware this was happening, but Wein dismisses Sirgis' claims. This naturally angers the Delunian prime minister, who promises Wein that he will face consequences for his actions. Wein takes Sirgis' threat with a grain of salt and travels to Soljest to form an alliance with King Gruyere instead. Wein and Ninym (once again disguised with black hair) are welcomed to the kingdom of Soljest with open arms by King Gruyere, who immediately invites them to a feast. At the dining hall, Wein meets Gruyere's daughter Princess Tolcheila, who introduces the Natran prince to all of Soljest's finest cuisine dishes, effectively preventing him from bringing up the subject of an alliance. For the remainder of his stay, Wein tries to strike up a conversation with Gruyere about an alliance but is avoided at every turn by the king. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Wein Answers Lowa\u2019s Marriage Proposal Amid Chaos                  The moment Gruyere makes for Wein to hear his proposal for an alliance, he is surprisingly kind to Ninym, who he is aware is actually Flahm and is not fooled by her change in hair color. Wein remains distrustful of Gruyere and anticipates an assassination plot against him, but Gruyere continues to prove him wrong and instead shares his more liberal political views. This catches Wein off guard; he did not expect this from a western monarch who subscribes to the oppressive Levetian religion. When he especially shares his belief that Flahm is an equal race of people worthy of the same rights and respect afforded to other races, this is enough to win Wein's immediate trust. When he especially accepts Wein's proposal of an alliance, it puts his mind at ease about Natra's future. Unbeknownst to Wein, he fell right into Gruyere's trap, which he does not become aware of until he returns to Natra. The moment he makes it back to his palace, he quickly learns that Delunio invaded Marden, which in turn caused Soljest to declare war against Natra. Wein then connects all the dots and figures out what really happened during his stay in Soljest. Prior to his arrival, Delunio's prime minister formed an alliance with King Gruyere to seize Marden over their void lease, but he is in fact targeting Natra. Gruyere then facilitated the prime minister's goals by playing to Wein's weaknesses to temporarily gain his trust and strike when he least expected it. With Natra about to go to war against a more powerful kingdom, Zenovia suggests reconciling with Delunio, which is a political ally of Soljest. She reasons that if Natra and Delunio enter a peace treaty, this will invalidate Soljest's declaration of war. She also wants to do her part to avoid another costly war, although Wein cooks up an idea to \"turn things upside down\" on both Delunio and Soljest. However, his plan may require backing from the more powerful Earthworld Empire and especially Princess Lowellmina, who is the only eastern monarch besides Wein who can successfully defeat the western kingdoms.

Is Samurai Flamenco Just a Failed Version of Tiger & Bunny? After a jarring tonal shift in its seventh episode, did Samurai Flamenco end up becoming just a lesser version of Tiger & Bunny?     By Timothy Donohoo Published 13 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Though the genre has been huge for decades in the West, anime takes on the American superhero concept have been fairly few and far between. This changed with hits such as\u00a0My Hero Academia and\u00a0One-Punch Man, though there were other anime that also capitalized on\u00a0the trend. One of these was\u00a0Tiger & Bunny, a hit series -- in Japan, at least -- that was a take mainly on Japanese tokusatsu heroes. It wasn't the only anime to do this, however. Samurai Flamenco was\u00a0notably\u00a0similar in nature to\u00a0Tiger & Bunny, from its cast to its very premise. Unfortunately, the former didn't become the cult hit that\u00a0Tiger & Bunny did, and it's mainly down to quality. Unfavorably compared to its spiritual predecessor,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco failed to attract fans of its own, and perhaps for good reason. Here's a look back at the lesser superhero anime of the 2010s.  RELATED:\u00a0What Makes Tokyo Mew Mew So Special? What Was Samurai Flamenco?                  Running from 2013 to 2014,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco follows Masayoshi Hazama, a male model who wishes to become a superhero. This was always a childhood dream of his, as he looked up to and idolized the superheroes in fiction. Unfortunately he's a completely normal guy, lacking either superpowers or the means to build a powerful suit with which to become a hero. Despite these limitations, he endeavors to act as the heroic Samurai Flamenco, fighting against crime and defending the downtrodden. His unlikely ally in this mission is the police officer Hidenori Goto, who helps him after discovering his secret identity. Together they face numerous threats, including some that come right out of a comic book. The similarities to\u00a0Tiger & Bunny are pretty clear. Both feature two \"heroes\" working to fight crimes, even if they disagree on each other's methods of heroism. Likewise, the heroes in both shows have suits reminiscent of tokusatsu heroes such as Kamen Rider and the many colored Rangers of\u00a0Super Sentai. They also both act as sort-of deconstructions of both Western and Eastern superhero tropes, inverting expectations in a way that's meant to be fresh. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work out so well for\u00a0Samurai Flamenco, and not just because of its competition. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia Teases the Final One For All Quirk - and Toga's Revenge Why Samurai Flamenco\u00a0Failed to Measure Up to Tiger & Bunny                  Samurai Flamenco came out about two years after\u00a0Tiger & Bunny, and it's due to this that it felt like such a Johnny-Come-Lately. It didn't have much in way of originality\u00a0regarding\u00a0tokusatsu or Western superheroics, especially when compared to\u00a0T&B. Of course, unfavorable comparisons to trend-setters are expected, and it's been a criticism thrown toward several supposed ripoffs of\u00a0hits such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Still, these criticisms wouldn't stick so deeply if the show itself didn't have other issues. Starting out as a promising series,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco\u00a0almost feels like a tokusatsu version of the American comic book and movie series\u00a0Kick-Ass. Unfortunately, this darkly humorous tone\u00a0goes purely dark after Episode 7, where it becomes a deadly serious retread of tokusatsu monster-of-the-week stories. Despite how the series becomes even more ridiculous by this point, it abandons any sort of tongue-in-cheek quality and instead plays itself completely straight. This jarring change is made worse by the fact that its narrative is completely unexpected. The shift isn't foreshadowed whatsoever; instead, it simply feels like the showrunners had gotten bored of what the\u00a0series\u00a0had\u00a0been\u00a0about. Many viewers dropped out after this, unable to get on board with the dramatic change in the show's tone. There was room for more character development, though this didn't save the series. Thus,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco failed to really attract a big audience -- not that it deserved one given the arguably still-niche status of the much better\u00a0Tiger & Bunny. The latter is finally receiving a second season after several years, but it's highly unlikely that its wannabe counterpart will ever be continued.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 13 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Though the genre has been huge for decades in the West, anime takes on the American superhero concept have been fairly few and far between. This changed with hits such as\u00a0My Hero Academia and\u00a0One-Punch Man, though there were other anime that also capitalized on\u00a0the trend. One of these was\u00a0Tiger & Bunny, a hit series -- in Japan, at least -- that was a take mainly on Japanese tokusatsu heroes. It wasn't the only anime to do this, however. Samurai Flamenco was\u00a0notably\u00a0similar in nature to\u00a0Tiger & Bunny, from its cast to its very premise. Unfortunately, the former didn't become the cult hit that\u00a0Tiger & Bunny did, and it's mainly down to quality. Unfavorably compared to its spiritual predecessor,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco failed to attract fans of its own, and perhaps for good reason. Here's a look back at the lesser superhero anime of the 2010s.  RELATED:\u00a0What Makes Tokyo Mew Mew So Special? What Was Samurai Flamenco?                  Running from 2013 to 2014,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco follows Masayoshi Hazama, a male model who wishes to become a superhero. This was always a childhood dream of his, as he looked up to and idolized the superheroes in fiction. Unfortunately he's a completely normal guy, lacking either superpowers or the means to build a powerful suit with which to become a hero. Despite these limitations, he endeavors to act as the heroic Samurai Flamenco, fighting against crime and defending the downtrodden. His unlikely ally in this mission is the police officer Hidenori Goto, who helps him after discovering his secret identity. Together they face numerous threats, including some that come right out of a comic book. The similarities to\u00a0Tiger & Bunny are pretty clear. Both feature two \"heroes\" working to fight crimes, even if they disagree on each other's methods of heroism. Likewise, the heroes in both shows have suits reminiscent of tokusatsu heroes such as Kamen Rider and the many colored Rangers of\u00a0Super Sentai. They also both act as sort-of deconstructions of both Western and Eastern superhero tropes, inverting expectations in a way that's meant to be fresh. Unfortunately, this doesn't quite work out so well for\u00a0Samurai Flamenco, and not just because of its competition. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia Teases the Final One For All Quirk - and Toga's Revenge Why Samurai Flamenco\u00a0Failed to Measure Up to Tiger & Bunny                  Samurai Flamenco came out about two years after\u00a0Tiger & Bunny, and it's due to this that it felt like such a Johnny-Come-Lately. It didn't have much in way of originality\u00a0regarding\u00a0tokusatsu or Western superheroics, especially when compared to\u00a0T&B. Of course, unfavorable comparisons to trend-setters are expected, and it's been a criticism thrown toward several supposed ripoffs of\u00a0hits such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Still, these criticisms wouldn't stick so deeply if the show itself didn't have other issues. Starting out as a promising series,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco\u00a0almost feels like a tokusatsu version of the American comic book and movie series\u00a0Kick-Ass. Unfortunately, this darkly humorous tone\u00a0goes purely dark after Episode 7, where it becomes a deadly serious retread of tokusatsu monster-of-the-week stories. Despite how the series becomes even more ridiculous by this point, it abandons any sort of tongue-in-cheek quality and instead plays itself completely straight. This jarring change is made worse by the fact that its narrative is completely unexpected. The shift isn't foreshadowed whatsoever; instead, it simply feels like the showrunners had gotten bored of what the\u00a0series\u00a0had\u00a0been\u00a0about. Many viewers dropped out after this, unable to get on board with the dramatic change in the show's tone. There was room for more character development, though this didn't save the series. Thus,\u00a0Samurai Flamenco failed to really attract a big audience -- not that it deserved one given the arguably still-niche status of the much better\u00a0Tiger & Bunny. The latter is finally receiving a second season after several years, but it's highly unlikely that its wannabe counterpart will ever be continued.

Valnet (a subsidiary of the  Valsef) investment group) oversees operation of CBR across all platforms on which the brand appears: Google, Facebook, YouTube, and a host of other social media and news platforms.     Valnet Inc. does not influence or otherwise dictate the opinions of the editorial teams nor interfere with site objectives, voice, or topic selection.  Programmatic advertising platforms fund the majority of website operations, editorial salaries, and content payouts; still, the CBR editorial staff, writers, and content team operate independent of Valnet\u2019s Ad-Ops team.     The two do not interact nor influence each other\u2019s work. Representation of all viewpoints, perspectives, and writers of all backgrounds are strongly encouraged by     the senior editors - ensuring that objectivity and accuracy of our content is never restricted by any one writer, editor, partner, or business division. Note: While we strive to provide readers with a great ad experience, advertisements may not necessarily reflect the views of CBR or Valnet Inc. On rare occasions, partnerships, direct sales campaigns, and sponsorships are negotiated by our ads team or content teams. Sponsored articles are clearly identified with a disclosure statement identifying the post accordingly. Similarly, select articles also include affiliate     links for which Valnet receives a commission on purchased items. Articles that include affiliate links also contain a statement disclosing an affiliate partnership.  The CBR editorial team leverages relationships with studios, networks and other partners for the purpose of exclusive interviews, review products and other opportunities that help create informed and accurate content.

By Jonathon Greenall Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Gundam is a legendary mecha series that's often regarded as one of the best manga and anime franchises ever created. Since its debut in 1979, Gundam has gone from strength to strength, spawning an entire genre and\u00a0numerous spin-off series\u00a0while\u00a0becoming a global phenomenon with its shows and toys being sold in many countries. However, Gundam wasn't always the revered international series it is today -- and nowhere was\u00a0this\u00a0made clearer than with the infamous\u00a0Doozy Bots. The American anime scene in 1991 was completely different from what it is today. Long before anime was available via easily accessed streaming platforms and simulcasts, the only way American fans could watch anime was to hope a series was localized. However, this\u00a0often meant big changes\u00a0with a new\u00a0story\u00a0being placed over the existing animation. The best example of this is 1985's Robotech, which combined Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross\u00a0and Genesis Climber MOSPEADA into one series with a whole new plot.  Related:\u00a0Gundam: The Witch From Mercury Showcases The Franchise\u2019s First Female Protagonist                  The studio behind the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Sunrise, tried to pitch Gundam to the American market but didn't simply dub the original series. Instead, in 1991\u00a0it\u00a0created a pilot called Doozy Bots. This\u00a0episode took old Gundam designs and placed them in a new animated series with an original story. This particular tale focuses on Professor Doozy, an eccentric\u00a0man who built a group of powerful robots. But when these robots go rogue, the professor is forced to stop them before they can create an army and steal all the world's fun. Teaming up with five of his students\u00a0--\u00a0Max, Polly, Scossie, Wipe-Down and Cole -- the professor uses a new invention on them, putting their brains into the bodies of tiny robots. These robots are called Guncannon, Guntank, Re-GZ, GM, and amusingly, Gundam. The\u00a0quintet is dubbed the Doozy Bots, and they head out to fight the evil robots and bring peace to the world in a series of comedic adventures. Interestingly, the robots in Doozy Bots don't use the legendary Gundam designs many fans\u00a0are\u00a0familiar with. Instead, they use the super-deformed robot designs of RX-78-2 Gundam, RX-77-2 Guncannon, RX-75-4 Guntank, RGZ-91 Re-GZ and RGM-79 GM from the Mobile Suit SD Gundam series. This\u00a0version started out as a series of short comics in Bandai's Model News Magazine\u00a0before expanding into capsule toys, OVAs and short films. By the time Doozy Bots was created, seven SD Gundam animations had been released. The series was\u00a0highly popular in Japan, with SD Gundam toys and merchandise regularly outselling the mainline Gundam franchise.

Only a short promotional trailer explaining the show has surfaced online, being reposted by many sources over the years. After this failed attempt, Sunrise dropped the idea entirely. It is easy to see why, as it's clear that\u00a0the studio didn't fully understand what the American market wanted from its cartoons. In fact, watching the trailer without context feels like a parody of 1980s American cartoons due to how over-the-top it is.

This allowed Gundam to finally make strong inroads into the American market. While Doozy Bots might seem utterly ludicrous today, it shows how much the international anime market has changed. No longer do\u00a0series have to totally change themselves to enter the American market, with more\u00a0anime than ever being imported via a subtitled or dubbed release. Hopefully, the Doozy Bots material will resurfaces one day, if only so this interesting historical curiosity can be enjoyed by Gundam fans and ephemera lovers alike.

But while the official group draws happen in early April, the tournament matches won't\u00a0begin until November, meaning soccer fans worldwide will have to wait a while to get their fix. For those\u00a0looking for a way to pass the time and build\u00a0their excitement for the World Cup, here are five excellent soccer-based manga to keep you busy until the big tournament kicks off in earnest later this year.

However, despite other teams having better facilities and bigger budgets, Tatsumi soon proves he's an expert at giant-killing. This series' focus on the backstage elements of the sport and the nature of coaching makes it stand out from the crowd. Giant Killing is available via Kodansha.

Blue Lock adds an almost dystopian twist to the usual format. Written by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and illustrated by Yusuke Nomura, the series follows Yoichi Isagi, a young boy selected for the mysterious new Blue Lock program, which was created after Japan crashed out of the 2018 World Cup. The Japanese government hires eccentric coach Ego Jinpachi in a desperate attempt to improve the team. Ego decides that Japan lacks a cocky goal-hungry striker, so he gathers 300 of the\u00a0nation's best young players and locks them in the Blue Lock compound to undergo intense training. To force the players to compete, any player who drops out of Blue Lock will be banned from the national team for life, forcing them to give it everything for the sake of their dreams. Leading to a unique, almost death-game twist on the genre,\u00a0Blue Lock is available to read and purchase via Kodansha.

But while the official group draws happen in early April, the tournament matches won't\u00a0begin until November, meaning soccer fans worldwide will have to wait a while to get their fix.

Blue Lock adds an almost dystopian twist to the usual format. Written by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and illustrated by Yusuke Nomura, the series follows Yoichi Isagi, a young boy selected for the mysterious new Blue Lock program, which was created after Japan crashed out of the 2018 World Cup. The Japanese government hires eccentric coach Ego Jinpachi in a desperate attempt to improve the team. Ego decides that Japan lacks a cocky goal-hungry striker, so he gathers 300 of the\u00a0nation's best young players and locks them in the Blue Lock compound to undergo intense training. To force the players to compete, any player who drops out of Blue Lock will be banned from the national team for life, forcing them to give it everything for the sake of their dreams. Leading to a unique, almost death-game twist on the genre,\u00a0Blue Lock is available to read and purchase via Kodansha.

Unfortunately, it's one that sets up some heartbreaking events.     By Renaldo Matadeen Updated 9 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Episode 179, \"Victor's Scheme.\" Naruto concluded a shocking note as Naruto and Sasuke, thanks to their Rasengan and Chidori respectively, lost their hands in the final battle. As both lay on the ground, missing their limbs, somehow they had time to joke about their past as they finally buried the hatchet. It was a metaphor for the sacrifice it took to defeat Kaguya and reset the shinobi world, understanding they needed to put petty differences aside. Now, in\u00a0Boruto: Naruto Next Generation Episode 179, Naruto's missing hand is finally addressed -- and it comes courtesy of an underrated, and ominous, upgrade.  RELATED:\u00a0Boruto Resurrects a Sinister Enemy - and Sasuke Pays the Price With His Prosthetic Arm, Naruto Can Harness His Full Power                  Sasuke never replaced his left arm, lost during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Instead, he began to use his katana more and perfect his other techniques. It was a reminder of how much he needed to atone for attacking Konoha. In contrast, Naruto's arm was recreated using Hashirama's cells, but bandaged to avoid looking like the evil White Zetsu. However, in Boruto Episode 179, Katasuke, head of Konoha's science division, meets Naruto and Shikamaru, and presents the perfected prosthetic arm. He considers it his greatest invention, because it's attuned to Naruto's chakra, not an easy feat considering Naruto has Kurama, the Nine-Tails Fox, inside him. This means Naruto can harness all of his power as if it were his real hand -- which leaves Katasuke glowing, because he has to make up for being brainwashed by a mysterious enemy into leaking Konoha's secrets during Boruto's exams. RELATED:\u00a0Boruto: Kara's Soldiers Aren't Impressive... EXCEPT for Delta How Naruto's New Arm in the Anime Differs From the Manga                  Naruto is excited that he can spar with Boruto and feel like the good old days again. To him, it's not merely a prototype, but a memento of his past. In the manga, this new arm allowed him to fight as normal. However, this also foreshadows death and destruction. In the manga, Katasuke gives Kawaki another prototype of this, and Naruto lends the kid chakra to stay healthy and for the arm to stay attached. It's ironic because the anime now has Kawaki being found by Konoha. The\u00a0Boruto\u00a0manga storyline involves Jigen using Naruto's chakra signature and connecting it to Kawaki's arm.\u00a0This arm would help the villain\u00a0track and locate Kawaki so he could teleport the kid and use him as a vessel to be reborn in. So while it seems all is well, this hand is going to place Kawaki in a very dark spot. Additionally, it's also what drives a wedge between Naruto and Boruto as Boruto gets jealous seeing his dad bond with Kawaki in a way they never did. Thus, as Katasuke celebrates his milestone, he has no clue his gift is going to upend Naruto's world by tearing his family apart and inviting in his deadliest enemy.

It was boring so I decided to write about things I love. On the geek side of things, I write about comics, cartoons, video games, television, movies and basically, all things nerdy. I also write about music in terms of punk, indie, hardcore and emo because well, they rock! If you're bored by now, then you also don't want to hear that I write for ESPN on the PR side of things. And yes, I've written sports for them too! Not bad for someone from the Caribbean, eh? To top all this off, I've scribed short films and documentaries, conceptualizing stories and scripts from a human interest and social justice perspective. Business-wise, I make big cheddar (not really) as a copywriter and digital strategist working with some of the top brands in the Latin America region. In closing, let me remind you that the geek shall inherit the Earth. Oh, FYI, I'd love to write the Gargoyles movie for Disney. YOLO. That said, I'm on Twitter @RenaldoMatadeen. So holler.

As both lay on the ground, missing their limbs, somehow they had time to joke about their past as they finally buried the hatchet. It was a metaphor for the sacrifice it took to defeat Kaguya and reset the shinobi world, understanding they needed to put petty differences aside. Now, in\u00a0Boruto: Naruto Next Generation Episode 179, Naruto's missing hand is finally addressed -- and it comes courtesy of an underrated, and ominous, upgrade.  RELATED:\u00a0Boruto Resurrects a Sinister Enemy - and Sasuke Pays the Price With His Prosthetic Arm, Naruto Can Harness His Full Power                  Sasuke never replaced his left arm, lost during the Fourth Shinobi World War. Instead, he began to use his katana more and perfect his other techniques. It was a reminder of how much he needed to atone for attacking Konoha. In contrast, Naruto's arm was recreated using Hashirama's cells, but bandaged to avoid looking like the evil White Zetsu. However, in Boruto Episode 179, Katasuke, head of Konoha's science division, meets Naruto and Shikamaru, and presents the perfected prosthetic arm. He considers it his greatest invention, because it's attuned to Naruto's chakra, not an easy feat considering Naruto has Kurama, the Nine-Tails Fox, inside him. This means Naruto can harness all of his power as if it were his real hand -- which leaves Katasuke glowing, because he has to make up for being brainwashed by a mysterious enemy into leaking Konoha's secrets during Boruto's exams. RELATED:\u00a0Boruto: Kara's Soldiers Aren't Impressive... EXCEPT for Delta How Naruto's New Arm in the Anime Differs From the Manga                  Naruto is excited that he can spar with Boruto and feel like the good old days again. To him, it's not merely a prototype, but a memento of his past. In the manga, this new arm allowed him to fight as normal. However, this also foreshadows death and destruction. In the manga, Katasuke gives Kawaki another prototype of this, and Naruto lends the kid chakra to stay healthy and for the arm to stay attached. It's ironic because the anime now has Kawaki being found by Konoha. The\u00a0Boruto\u00a0manga storyline involves Jigen using Naruto's chakra signature and connecting it to Kawaki's arm.\u00a0This arm would help the villain\u00a0track and locate Kawaki so he could teleport the kid and use him as a vessel to be reborn in. So while it seems all is well, this hand is going to place Kawaki in a very dark spot. Additionally, it's also what drives a wedge between Naruto and Boruto as Boruto gets jealous seeing his dad bond with Kawaki in a way they never did. Thus, as Katasuke celebrates his milestone, he has no clue his gift is going to upend Naruto's world by tearing his family apart and inviting in his deadliest enemy.

By Jessie Xu Published 12 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Korean manhwas have a distinctive style separate from Japanese mangas. They are often fully colored and geared toward a digital format, which is why they are optimized for scroll reading.\u00a0Manhwas also have their own distinctive story tropes and characters. Popular works like Solo Leveling and Tower of God belong to a \u2018main characters becoming overpowered as they progress through game-like battles and levels\u2019 trope. Another such popular trope is the idea of characters becoming overpowered after they reincarnate into a new world or back to their past.\u00a0Here's\u00a0a look at some works that specifically feature a female protagonist becoming badass after they reincarnate.  RELATED: Tower of God's Most Mysterious Family Head Finally Arrives Suddenly Became a Princess One Day: The Best Father/Daughter Relationship                  When\u00a0a woman finds herself reincarnated as Princess Athanasia in the romance novel\u00a0named Lovely Princess, she only has one thought: survive to adulthood and escape the palace.\u00a0This is because\u00a0in the novel, Princess Athanasia was ignored and scorned by her father, the cold heartless emperor Claude -- who ultimately killed her. Based on the light novel of the same name by Plutus, Suddenly Became a Princess One Day is one of the most highly rated manhwas on both the Korean site Ridibooks and the English app Tappytoon. Athanasia is an\u00a0extremely smart yet funny character as she tries to avoid death flags by currying favor with Claude. Her ability to calmly analyze and deal with each situation makes her one of the most badass female characters. RELATED: Gundam: The Witch From Mercury Showcases the Franchise's First Female Protagonist The Princess Imprints a Traitor: Gaining\u00a0the\u00a0Power to Fight for One\u2019s Rights                  The seventh imperial princess, Evenrose once died by self-poisoning after the royal family was overturned by the rebellion of homunculus. But when she opens her eyes again eight years in the past, she recognizes an opportunity to save her family and decides to prove herself worthy of becoming a successor. To achieve this, she names Michael, the king of homunculus and the leader of the rebellion in her previous life, as her personal guard. Evenrose is one of those characters\u00a0who truly learns from their mistakes and experiences. She understands that taking a backseat to\u00a0her family's actions because she doesn\u2019t condone them will not result in actual change. Thus, when she is given the opportunity to redo things, she takes the opposite stance and begins to gain power and support with her cunning and benevolence in The Princess Imprints a Traitor. RELATED: The Genius Prince's Guide: Wein Gets Burnt By a Certain Princess - & It's Not Lowa The Duchess With an Empty Soul: Valuing Self-Worth Is Most Important                  Ivona sacrificed everything for her fiance Gaspal, even her own life. Unfortunately, Gaspal is\u00a0awful and had a hidden lover -- Ivona\u2019s own cousin. Betrayed and angered by her own naivety, Ivona decides not to believe in love anymore. After finding herself back in the past, she enters a contractual marriage with Claude Agentine, the owner of the Royal Holy Sword. It\u2019s quite satisfying to see Ivona\u2019s confidence grow throughout\u00a0The Duchess With an Empty Soul as she recognizes her own worth and learns to use her power for herself rather than others. RELATED: Why Ranking of Kings' Ending Failed to Live Up to Its Earlier Episodes A Red Knight Does Not Blindly Follow Money                  The Imperial Knight Judith used to do anything for money, throwing away both her guilt and morality. When she is betrayed and killed, she realizes\u00a0money is useless in the face of death. A reincarnated Judith wakes up six years in the past as a new knight and decides not to pursue money blindly anymore by joining the Red Knights. A Red Knight Does Not Blindly Follow Money\u00a0stars a very well-rounded protagonist.\u00a0Judith has her strengths but is not overpowered\u00a0or without flaws born from the habits of her previous life and values. She tries to completely subvert her previous mindset and learns to treasure relationships instead of money. RELATED: Sasaki and Miyano Shows Why Communication Is Key to a Healthy Relationship A Stepmother's M\u00e4rchen: Blurring the Lines Between Children and Siblings                  Marchioness, Suri Pon Neuwanstein is ridiculed by noble society for becoming a widow so young with a husband much older than her. Despite this, she tries to raise her \u2018children\u2019 who aren\u2019t blood-related and old enough to be called her siblings. But on the morning of the oldest child Jeremy's wedding, Suri dies in a tragic accident. She wakes up seven years later on the morning of her husband\u2019s funeral and vows to end her suffering with her own strength. A Stepmother's M\u00e4rchen is an endearing story of familial bonds and building relationships. Suri becomes much stronger and more confident after reincarnation when she recognizes that accepting the ridicule and suffering was not beneficial to anyone.\u00a0Therefore, she begins to make active efforts to improve her own situation and relationships. RELATED: Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family? The Viridescent Crown: It Takes Two to Run a Dukedom                  In The Viridescent Crown, an ordinary college student finds herself in the novel she wrote at 15 years old, titled Eternal Love. She gets reincarnated back to seven years before the story began as the side character Ran Romea de Lazia, the daughter of the male lead, Yustaf\u2019s stepmother. Ran tries to change the course of events so that Yustaf can meet the female protagonist peacefully and find happiness. Ran is not an extremely overpowered or exceedingly smart character but is calm and logical. Through her knowledge of future events that will unfold, she is able to effectively plan for opportunities and avoid disasters. There are many manhwas out there of various tropes and styles, but stories with badass female protagonists are always worth the read. They provide a refreshing take on the reincarnation trope and subvert traditional gender stereotypes that female characters are weak.

By Jessie Xu Published 12 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Korean manhwas have a distinctive style separate from Japanese mangas. They are often fully colored and geared toward a digital format, which is why they are optimized for scroll reading.\u00a0Manhwas also have their own distinctive story tropes and characters. Popular works like Solo Leveling and Tower of God belong to a \u2018main characters becoming overpowered as they progress through game-like battles and levels\u2019 trope. Another such popular trope is the idea of characters becoming overpowered after they reincarnate into a new world or back to their past.\u00a0Here's\u00a0a look at some works that specifically feature a female protagonist becoming badass after they reincarnate.  RELATED: Tower of God's Most Mysterious Family Head Finally Arrives Suddenly Became a Princess One Day: The Best Father/Daughter Relationship                  When\u00a0a woman finds herself reincarnated as Princess Athanasia in the romance novel\u00a0named Lovely Princess, she only has one thought: survive to adulthood and escape the palace.\u00a0This is because\u00a0in the novel, Princess Athanasia was ignored and scorned by her father, the cold heartless emperor Claude -- who ultimately killed her. Based on the light novel of the same name by Plutus, Suddenly Became a Princess One Day is one of the most highly rated manhwas on both the Korean site Ridibooks and the English app Tappytoon. Athanasia is an\u00a0extremely smart yet funny character as she tries to avoid death flags by currying favor with Claude. Her ability to calmly analyze and deal with each situation makes her one of the most badass female characters. RELATED: Gundam: The Witch From Mercury Showcases the Franchise's First Female Protagonist The Princess Imprints a Traitor: Gaining\u00a0the\u00a0Power to Fight for One\u2019s Rights                  The seventh imperial princess, Evenrose once died by self-poisoning after the royal family was overturned by the rebellion of homunculus. But when she opens her eyes again eight years in the past, she recognizes an opportunity to save her family and decides to prove herself worthy of becoming a successor. To achieve this, she names Michael, the king of homunculus and the leader of the rebellion in her previous life, as her personal guard. Evenrose is one of those characters\u00a0who truly learns from their mistakes and experiences. She understands that taking a backseat to\u00a0her family's actions because she doesn\u2019t condone them will not result in actual change. Thus, when she is given the opportunity to redo things, she takes the opposite stance and begins to gain power and support with her cunning and benevolence in The Princess Imprints a Traitor. RELATED: The Genius Prince's Guide: Wein Gets Burnt By a Certain Princess - & It's Not Lowa The Duchess With an Empty Soul: Valuing Self-Worth Is Most Important                  Ivona sacrificed everything for her fiance Gaspal, even her own life. Unfortunately, Gaspal is\u00a0awful and had a hidden lover -- Ivona\u2019s own cousin. Betrayed and angered by her own naivety, Ivona decides not to believe in love anymore. After finding herself back in the past, she enters a contractual marriage with Claude Agentine, the owner of the Royal Holy Sword. It\u2019s quite satisfying to see Ivona\u2019s confidence grow throughout\u00a0The Duchess With an Empty Soul as she recognizes her own worth and learns to use her power for herself rather than others. RELATED: Why Ranking of Kings' Ending Failed to Live Up to Its Earlier Episodes A Red Knight Does Not Blindly Follow Money                  The Imperial Knight Judith used to do anything for money, throwing away both her guilt and morality. When she is betrayed and killed, she realizes\u00a0money is useless in the face of death. A reincarnated Judith wakes up six years in the past as a new knight and decides not to pursue money blindly anymore by joining the Red Knights. A Red Knight Does Not Blindly Follow Money\u00a0stars a very well-rounded protagonist.\u00a0Judith has her strengths but is not overpowered\u00a0or without flaws born from the habits of her previous life and values. She tries to completely subvert her previous mindset and learns to treasure relationships instead of money. RELATED: Sasaki and Miyano Shows Why Communication Is Key to a Healthy Relationship A Stepmother's M\u00e4rchen: Blurring the Lines Between Children and Siblings                  Marchioness, Suri Pon Neuwanstein is ridiculed by noble society for becoming a widow so young with a husband much older than her. Despite this, she tries to raise her \u2018children\u2019 who aren\u2019t blood-related and old enough to be called her siblings. But on the morning of the oldest child Jeremy's wedding, Suri dies in a tragic accident. She wakes up seven years later on the morning of her husband\u2019s funeral and vows to end her suffering with her own strength. A Stepmother's M\u00e4rchen is an endearing story of familial bonds and building relationships. Suri becomes much stronger and more confident after reincarnation when she recognizes that accepting the ridicule and suffering was not beneficial to anyone.\u00a0Therefore, she begins to make active efforts to improve her own situation and relationships. RELATED: Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family? The Viridescent Crown: It Takes Two to Run a Dukedom                  In The Viridescent Crown, an ordinary college student finds herself in the novel she wrote at 15 years old, titled Eternal Love. She gets reincarnated back to seven years before the story began as the side character Ran Romea de Lazia, the daughter of the male lead, Yustaf\u2019s stepmother. Ran tries to change the course of events so that Yustaf can meet the female protagonist peacefully and find happiness. Ran is not an extremely overpowered or exceedingly smart character but is calm and logical. Through her knowledge of future events that will unfold, she is able to effectively plan for opportunities and avoid disasters. There are many manhwas out there of various tropes and styles, but stories with badass female protagonists are always worth the read. They provide a refreshing take on the reincarnation trope and subvert traditional gender stereotypes that female characters are weak.

By Molly Kishikawa Published 10 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1045, \"Next Level,\" by Eiichiro Oda, Stephen Paul and Vanessa Satone, available in English from Viz Media. Chapter 1044 began with Luffy shocked that he survived Kaido's attack. Momonosuke revealed to Yamato that Zunesha has declared Joyboy has returned and that he and Luffy are one and the same. In Marijoa, the Five Elders revealed that the Gomu Gomu no Mi is in fact the Hito Hito no Mi: Mythical Type, Nika. By consuming this fruit, it allows Luffy to use his rubber body in any way he chooses. In the Treasure Repository, Orochi begged Hiyori for his life, but he ended up being set on fire by the spirit Kanjuro unleashed. Back on the Skull Dome, Luffy used his new power to give Kaido a proper beating, revealing that he can now use Gear Five.  In Chapter 1045, Kaido tells Luffy that he was sure that Luffy had died, to which Luffy agrees. Kaido also points out that being able to turn his surroundings into rubber means that Luffy has indeed experienced a Devil Fruit Awakening. However, Kaido is still under the impression that Luffy's fruit is a Paramethia type until he talks himself through it. He says that a transformation like the one Luffy has undergone is more associated with a Zoan fruit and lunges at Luffy, who is just reclining in the air without a care. RELATED: Is a Turn-Based Battle System Right for One Piece Odyssey?                  Kaido, in his dragon form, snaps his mouth shut around Luffy, who tries to keep the dragon's mouth open but is promptly swallowed. In retaliation, he bounces around inside of Kaido before expanding in a move he calls \"Gum-Gum\u00a0Balloon.\" The expansion causes Kaido to appear as though he's gained weight to Yamato and Momonosuke, who have just poked their heads over the edge of the Skull Dome. Yamato wonders if\u00a0Kaido could always so this, not realizing it's actually Luffy causing the bloating. Kaido is enraged at the reaction of his body, saying it's not made of rubber like Luffy's. Inside Kaido, Luffy is able to see light filtering through Kaido's eyes. To pull himself out, he shoves his arms into Kaido's eyes and grabs his snout, using it to propel his body forward and out of Kaido's body. He calls this move his Gum-Gum Escape Rocket. RELATED: One Piece Odyssey: Trailer, News & Latest Updates                  With a giant grin on his face, he begins rapidly expelling the air out of his body and goes flying like a deflated balloon into the clouds above. He then reappears in a giant form he calls \"Gum-Gum Giant,\" coming down on top of Kaido, surprising him, Yamato, and Momonosuke. The two spectators are shocked at Luffy's appearance, especially his giant size, and wonder if it's actually him. Kaido bites down on Luffy, who grabs his head and tail and starts using him as a jump rope as the two plummet towards the ground, calling it \"Gum-Gum Jump Rope.\" Kaido takes this chance to launch a Blast Breath directly at Luffy, who takes the full damage. He's knocked away from the Skull Dome and begins to fall, his body charred and burned. He quickly recovers and by rapidly rotating his legs like wheels, runs on air back to Onigashima, leaving a trail of flames behind him. As he flies towards Kaido, the Emperor of the Sea attacks him with Conquerer of Three Worlds, Ragnaraku. Luffy's head goes crashing through the roof of the Skull Dome and to the Live Floor below. Everyone is so shocked at the sight of Luffy that their eyes literally pop out of their skulls. Luffy pulls his head out of the hole with a snap, falling backwards onto his back. Kaido says it's like something out of a comic, but that despite Luffy's energetic performance, he's still almost at his limit. Luffy counters this, but his energy quickly depletes, resulting in his face looking ages and worn. He's so drained he can't even hold his head up. RELATED: One Piece: Will Luffy's New Powers Appear in the Upcoming Movie?                  Luffy admits \"Ah'm all tuckered out,\" prompting Kaido to ask Luffy who he is, confused about the total 180 the Straw Hat has taken. Luffy admits to Kaido that he was dying before now, that the fight is taking a toll on him. Kaido offers some form of comfort to him, saying that stories will be told about the battle. Luffy doesn't care about that, saying that the only thing that remains after death are bones. Now that he's back to his normal form, Yamato says that Luffy's white hair and clothes made him unrecognizable. Momonosuke is more worried about Luffy's \"voice\" beginning to quickly fade once again. Luffy manages to rise to his feet once again, declaring that they're not finished. He thinks about all of the people who have helped him along the way and sacrificed themselves for the cause, his strength returning in the process. Kaido warns him that he'll die, but Luffy says he isn't afraid of that. Kaido goes in to attack with his kanabo, but Luffy's once again attains his\u00a0Awakened form just as Kaido reaches him. Yamato shouts out for Luffy to watch out, but Kaido's attack lands on the back of Luffy's skull. Rather than collapsing as he did before, Luffy's head instead conforms to the shape of the kanabo, keeping its shape as he runs away. Kaido swings again, this time from the top, but again Luffy's head merely squishes and absorbs the attack, though it does still cause him pain. RELATED: One Piece: The True Nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, Explained                  The force of the attack sends Luffy bouncing against the ground and into the air like a ball, with him taking advantage of this by using the momentum to land on a nearby rock formation and launch himself towards Kaido. As Luffy comes towards him, arm swinging, Kaido wonders what this white transformation, his use of the Color of Armament and Supreme King Haki, and ability to manipulate anything around him are. Despite his thoughts, he stands firm that nobody can beat him. However, Luffy's attack lands, Kaido's face crumpling from the force and shocking Yamato and Momo. As Kaido collapses to the ground, Luffy asks him, \"Isn't this fun, Kaido?!!\" The next chapter of One Piece will be available on Sunday, April 10th.\u00a0 KEEP READING: One Piece: How Wild Can Luffy Get With His New Powers?

By Molly Kishikawa Published 10 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1045, \"Next Level,\" by Eiichiro Oda, Stephen Paul and Vanessa Satone, available in English from Viz Media. Chapter 1044 began with Luffy shocked that he survived Kaido's attack. Momonosuke revealed to Yamato that Zunesha has declared Joyboy has returned and that he and Luffy are one and the same. In Marijoa, the Five Elders revealed that the Gomu Gomu no Mi is in fact the Hito Hito no Mi: Mythical Type, Nika. By consuming this fruit, it allows Luffy to use his rubber body in any way he chooses. In the Treasure Repository, Orochi begged Hiyori for his life, but he ended up being set on fire by the spirit Kanjuro unleashed. Back on the Skull Dome, Luffy used his new power to give Kaido a proper beating, revealing that he can now use Gear Five.  In Chapter 1045, Kaido tells Luffy that he was sure that Luffy had died, to which Luffy agrees. Kaido also points out that being able to turn his surroundings into rubber means that Luffy has indeed experienced a Devil Fruit Awakening. However, Kaido is still under the impression that Luffy's fruit is a Paramethia type until he talks himself through it. He says that a transformation like the one Luffy has undergone is more associated with a Zoan fruit and lunges at Luffy, who is just reclining in the air without a care. RELATED: Is a Turn-Based Battle System Right for One Piece Odyssey?                  Kaido, in his dragon form, snaps his mouth shut around Luffy, who tries to keep the dragon's mouth open but is promptly swallowed. In retaliation, he bounces around inside of Kaido before expanding in a move he calls \"Gum-Gum\u00a0Balloon.\" The expansion causes Kaido to appear as though he's gained weight to Yamato and Momonosuke, who have just poked their heads over the edge of the Skull Dome. Yamato wonders if\u00a0Kaido could always so this, not realizing it's actually Luffy causing the bloating. Kaido is enraged at the reaction of his body, saying it's not made of rubber like Luffy's. Inside Kaido, Luffy is able to see light filtering through Kaido's eyes. To pull himself out, he shoves his arms into Kaido's eyes and grabs his snout, using it to propel his body forward and out of Kaido's body. He calls this move his Gum-Gum Escape Rocket. RELATED: One Piece Odyssey: Trailer, News & Latest Updates                  With a giant grin on his face, he begins rapidly expelling the air out of his body and goes flying like a deflated balloon into the clouds above. He then reappears in a giant form he calls \"Gum-Gum Giant,\" coming down on top of Kaido, surprising him, Yamato, and Momonosuke. The two spectators are shocked at Luffy's appearance, especially his giant size, and wonder if it's actually him. Kaido bites down on Luffy, who grabs his head and tail and starts using him as a jump rope as the two plummet towards the ground, calling it \"Gum-Gum Jump Rope.\" Kaido takes this chance to launch a Blast Breath directly at Luffy, who takes the full damage. He's knocked away from the Skull Dome and begins to fall, his body charred and burned. He quickly recovers and by rapidly rotating his legs like wheels, runs on air back to Onigashima, leaving a trail of flames behind him. As he flies towards Kaido, the Emperor of the Sea attacks him with Conquerer of Three Worlds, Ragnaraku. Luffy's head goes crashing through the roof of the Skull Dome and to the Live Floor below. Everyone is so shocked at the sight of Luffy that their eyes literally pop out of their skulls. Luffy pulls his head out of the hole with a snap, falling backwards onto his back. Kaido says it's like something out of a comic, but that despite Luffy's energetic performance, he's still almost at his limit. Luffy counters this, but his energy quickly depletes, resulting in his face looking ages and worn. He's so drained he can't even hold his head up. RELATED: One Piece: Will Luffy's New Powers Appear in the Upcoming Movie?                  Luffy admits \"Ah'm all tuckered out,\" prompting Kaido to ask Luffy who he is, confused about the total 180 the Straw Hat has taken. Luffy admits to Kaido that he was dying before now, that the fight is taking a toll on him. Kaido offers some form of comfort to him, saying that stories will be told about the battle. Luffy doesn't care about that, saying that the only thing that remains after death are bones. Now that he's back to his normal form, Yamato says that Luffy's white hair and clothes made him unrecognizable. Momonosuke is more worried about Luffy's \"voice\" beginning to quickly fade once again. Luffy manages to rise to his feet once again, declaring that they're not finished. He thinks about all of the people who have helped him along the way and sacrificed themselves for the cause, his strength returning in the process. Kaido warns him that he'll die, but Luffy says he isn't afraid of that. Kaido goes in to attack with his kanabo, but Luffy's once again attains his\u00a0Awakened form just as Kaido reaches him. Yamato shouts out for Luffy to watch out, but Kaido's attack lands on the back of Luffy's skull. Rather than collapsing as he did before, Luffy's head instead conforms to the shape of the kanabo, keeping its shape as he runs away. Kaido swings again, this time from the top, but again Luffy's head merely squishes and absorbs the attack, though it does still cause him pain. RELATED: One Piece: The True Nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, Explained                  The force of the attack sends Luffy bouncing against the ground and into the air like a ball, with him taking advantage of this by using the momentum to land on a nearby rock formation and launch himself towards Kaido. As Luffy comes towards him, arm swinging, Kaido wonders what this white transformation, his use of the Color of Armament and Supreme King Haki, and ability to manipulate anything around him are. Despite his thoughts, he stands firm that nobody can beat him. However, Luffy's attack lands, Kaido's face crumpling from the force and shocking Yamato and Momo. As Kaido collapses to the ground, Luffy asks him, \"Isn't this fun, Kaido?!!\" The next chapter of One Piece will be available on Sunday, April 10th.\u00a0 KEEP READING: One Piece: How Wild Can Luffy Get With His New Powers?

By Jessie Xu Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Japanese anime has propelled the world of animation into a whole new realm of popularity and diversity, and the medium has remained the most popular style of animation since its explosion into mainstream popularity. However, there's also donghua -- a style of Chinese animation that can often be overshadowed by its more popular Japanese counterpart. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t great donghua series with captivating stories. Below are some of the very best of them. RELATED: Donghua: What to Know & Where to Get Started The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation: A Story of Angst, Injustice and Trust                  The Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation is a supernatural mystery cultivation story based on a web novel of the same name written by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu. It follows Wei Wuxian, a demonic cultivator who once deviated from the proper path of cultivation and was ultimately killed by his closest ally. When he finds himself reincarnated in the body of a lunatic one day, he decides to embark on a journey to unravel the mysteries of the past that threaten to overturn the peace of the present. Along the way, he reunites with Lan Wangji, an old classmate who he once believed to have hated him.  This story is wonderfully paced, with all the seemingly unrelated events interwoven in an invisible web of mysteries beneath the surface. The characters themselves are very well built with clear reasons behind their actions. Each character plays a role in the overall plot and progression of the story, even characters that seem minor when they are first introduced. Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing: A Tale of Sacrifice and Devotion                  Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing is another series based on a web novel of the same name by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu. Xie Lian was once a beloved and respected martial god 800 years ago, but after a series of events catapulted him out of the Heavens, he became the laughingstock of the Three Realms. He ascends to the Heavens for the third time, but now as a pitiful scrap-collecting god with no followers. On his first mission in the mortal realm to pay back his debts, he runs into a red-clothed youth who he later discovers is The Crimson Rain Sought Flower Hua Cheng, a ghost king feared by gods and ghosts alike. Do heavenly officials truly represent good? Are ghosts always malicious? These are some of the questions the series addresses as Xie Lian and Hua Cheng become the most unlikely of companions. RELATED: How a Forgotten Donghua Copied Popular Mecha Anime & Changed Chinese Media Scumbag System: A Goodie Bag of Misunderstandings and Comedy                  What happens when Shen Yuan, an annoyed reader of the xianxia novel Proud Immortal Demon Way, transmigrates into the very novel he was cursing about before his death? He gets paired with a scumbag system and is forced to play out the role of the scumbag master Shen Qingqiu, who meets a tragic end after bullying his disciple, the protagonist of the original story, Luo Binghe. The entire story is centered around Shen Yuan trying to avoid his tragic end. His internal monologue as he bickers with the scumbag system he\u2019s been bound to is one of the highlights of this series, which melds a cohesive mix of comedy and tragedy. Link Click: Time Travel Is Serious Business                  A picture can say a thousand words and hold a multitude of secrets. Chen Xiaoshi and Lu Guang are two people who know this fact very well. They help their clients resolve issues and regrets, and their ability to jump into photographs and relive the events of the time through the eyes of the photographer gives them great power. However, there's one catch: they cannot change the past. One wrong move could create a ripple effect of changes. Will they be able to put aside personal feelings and resist the urge to change the past? Time travel can often be a difficult concept to tackle in anime due to all the intricacies and paradoxes. Nonetheless, like the vastly popular Steins;Gate, Link Click has managed to produce a riveting supernatural mystery story that remains sound in both logic and flow. RELATED: Link Click Drops Trailer For Season 2 The King\u2019s Avatar: The Reality of the World of Pro Gamers                  The King\u2019s Avatar follows Ye Xiu, a well-regarded professional player in the multiplayer game Glory, through his fall from fame when he is forced to retire from his company. He rejoins the game once more at the release of the tenth server, this time using a new character named \u201cLord Grim.\u201d This story seems deceptively simple at first. A pro gamer falls from fame and slowly climbs his way back up to the top. However, there is an undertone of seriousness as the series offers a deeper insight into the realities of being a professional player and the harshness of the industry itself. Thousand Autumns: Will Someone Stay True to Their Beliefs Even After Betrayals?                  Mount Xundu\u2019s lead disciple Shen Qiao is saved by the cunning Cleansing Moon sect leader Yan Wushi when he nearly dies from his injuries after being defeated by the leader of the Beimu Clan. Yan Wushi hatches a devious plot: turn the kind Shen Qiao into a demonic cultivator who can be his rival. When Shen Qiao is thrust into this world of deception and betrayal so far apart from the tranquility of his mountain home, will he still stay true to his beliefs when everyone he trusted has betrayed him? The moral values and beliefs of two completely opposite characters come to a head in this series. By challenging the beliefs of both characters as they interact with each other, it blurs the lines between good and evil. KEEP READING: Could Genshin Impact Become the Next Big Donghua Hit?

By Hilary Leung Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Requiem of the Rose King Episode 10, \"My Name Is Richard Plantagenet,\" and Episode 11, \u201cThat is my...my punishment,\u201d now streaming on Funimation. Requiem of the Rose King\u00a0utilizes dramatic irony in the best and worst way possible. Every viewer knew who Richard and Henry really were from the very first episode and could already predict the trajectory of their relationship. Unfortunately the two characters didn't know,\u00a0subsequently\u00a0falling in love without ever realizing the other's real identity. There are a lot of characters who have the same first name in this series, so it's\u00a0little wonder Richard never suspected his Henry would be\u00a0the\u00a0Henry.  When Richard found out who Henry really was in Episode 10, he was utterly destroyed. This was the man he had been willing to throw his life away to live with. Never in a million years did he think he would fall in love with his mortal enemy. The conflict between the Yorks and Lancasters has come to a close, but it does little to bring the closure Richard seeks. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King Breaks Gender Norms - But at What Cost?                  In Episode 10 of\u00a0Requiem of the Rose King,\u00a0the final battle between Lancaster and York sees Richard rush across the battlegrounds in search of King Henry. As soon as he killed Henry, the final piece to his avenging his father would be complete and he would be reunited with his beloved in their forest. Without him realizing it, Richard's vision of Joan and his father -- one attempting to lead him astray and the other attempting to guide him -- foreshadows his inner conflict. Joan taunts Richard as per usual, but this time there's a note of warning in her voice:\u00a0if he pursues this any further, he'll find that the king he seeks to kill is the same man as the one he holds close to his heart.\u00a0There's no way to tell if her intentions were genuine, but for a moment it looked as though Joan was sincerely trying to help Richard. The tension ratchets up a hundredfold when, on the other side, Henry is coming to terms with the realization that he has failed as a king. For years, he had stood to the side and watched as his people died for him and all he'd done was pray for salvation. Seeing Richard was the last straw in pushing Henry's sanity over the edge. RELATED:\u00a0Romeo \u00d7 Juliet: The Shakespeare Anime That Predates Requiem of the Rose King                  Richard's light had initially been his father; when the latter died,\u00a0his son had sunken into darkness -- but it was one he wholeheartedly embraced. When he met Henry, he found another source of light in his life, more pure and innocent but still unconditionally accepting. The problem was was that in order for Richard to fully embrace Henry, he needed to leave the hell his father's death had put him in. He believed that by killing the king, would he finally \"gain light.\" The moment when Henry confesses he\u00a0is the king of England is\u00a0powerful, and it\u00a0puts Richard in a deeper hell than before. At least with his father's death, he had a goal and it was clear what he needed to do. But what was\u00a0he supposed to do here?\u00a0A motif of drowning\u00a0has been threaded throughout Requiem of the Rose King, but\u00a0the imagery\u00a0focused on Richard being choked to death by the monsters. Episode 11's motif changes to an image of\u00a0him sinking into a pile of skeletons -- he's still a victim, but Buckingham and his father's words are now forcing him into being\u00a0a mindless killing machine as\u00a0punishment. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King Creator Shares Her The Batman Fan Art Episode 11 also has more characters revealing their true identities.\u00a0Even though Edward is revealed to be Henry's son, it hardly has the same impact on Richard that Anne's reveal did; despite Edward's attempts to court him, Richard had never really cared for him. Seeing Anne impersonating Edward and then defending him was a double whammy of betrayal for Richard, who had already -- mistakenly -- heard Anne's refusal to marry him. In Richard's eyes, the Lancasters had taken everything from him and humiliated him. There's a certain eerie and sad beauty in Edward's final scene. For him, being killed by Richard, whom he has loved, would be poetic -- romantic even. As Richard's sword sinks into Edward's body, rose petals flutter away. But the stark red of the rose petals is symbolic in another way as it promises more bloodshed in Richard's future.

By Hilary Leung Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Requiem of the Rose King Episode 10, \"My Name Is Richard Plantagenet,\" and Episode 11, \u201cThat is my...my punishment,\u201d now streaming on Funimation. Requiem of the Rose King\u00a0utilizes dramatic irony in the best and worst way possible. Every viewer knew who Richard and Henry really were from the very first episode and could already predict the trajectory of their relationship. Unfortunately the two characters didn't know,\u00a0subsequently\u00a0falling in love without ever realizing the other's real identity. There are a lot of characters who have the same first name in this series, so it's\u00a0little wonder Richard never suspected his Henry would be\u00a0the\u00a0Henry.  When Richard found out who Henry really was in Episode 10, he was utterly destroyed. This was the man he had been willing to throw his life away to live with. Never in a million years did he think he would fall in love with his mortal enemy. The conflict between the Yorks and Lancasters has come to a close, but it does little to bring the closure Richard seeks. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King Breaks Gender Norms - But at What Cost?                  In Episode 10 of\u00a0Requiem of the Rose King,\u00a0the final battle between Lancaster and York sees Richard rush across the battlegrounds in search of King Henry. As soon as he killed Henry, the final piece to his avenging his father would be complete and he would be reunited with his beloved in their forest. Without him realizing it, Richard's vision of Joan and his father -- one attempting to lead him astray and the other attempting to guide him -- foreshadows his inner conflict. Joan taunts Richard as per usual, but this time there's a note of warning in her voice:\u00a0if he pursues this any further, he'll find that the king he seeks to kill is the same man as the one he holds close to his heart.\u00a0There's no way to tell if her intentions were genuine, but for a moment it looked as though Joan was sincerely trying to help Richard. The tension ratchets up a hundredfold when, on the other side, Henry is coming to terms with the realization that he has failed as a king. For years, he had stood to the side and watched as his people died for him and all he'd done was pray for salvation. Seeing Richard was the last straw in pushing Henry's sanity over the edge. RELATED:\u00a0Romeo \u00d7 Juliet: The Shakespeare Anime That Predates Requiem of the Rose King                  Richard's light had initially been his father; when the latter died,\u00a0his son had sunken into darkness -- but it was one he wholeheartedly embraced. When he met Henry, he found another source of light in his life, more pure and innocent but still unconditionally accepting. The problem was was that in order for Richard to fully embrace Henry, he needed to leave the hell his father's death had put him in. He believed that by killing the king, would he finally \"gain light.\" The moment when Henry confesses he\u00a0is the king of England is\u00a0powerful, and it\u00a0puts Richard in a deeper hell than before. At least with his father's death, he had a goal and it was clear what he needed to do. But what was\u00a0he supposed to do here?\u00a0A motif of drowning\u00a0has been threaded throughout Requiem of the Rose King, but\u00a0the imagery\u00a0focused on Richard being choked to death by the monsters. Episode 11's motif changes to an image of\u00a0him sinking into a pile of skeletons -- he's still a victim, but Buckingham and his father's words are now forcing him into being\u00a0a mindless killing machine as\u00a0punishment. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King Creator Shares Her The Batman Fan Art Episode 11 also has more characters revealing their true identities.\u00a0Even though Edward is revealed to be Henry's son, it hardly has the same impact on Richard that Anne's reveal did; despite Edward's attempts to court him, Richard had never really cared for him.

In Richard's eyes, the Lancasters had taken everything from him and humiliated him. There's a certain eerie and sad beauty in Edward's final scene. For him, being killed by Richard, whom he has loved, would be poetic -- romantic even. As Richard's sword sinks into Edward's body, rose petals flutter away. But the stark red of the rose petals is symbolic in another way as it promises more bloodshed in Richard's future.

Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Miranjo and King Bosse's relationship in Ranking of Kings has caused a lot of tragic events. Here's what their complicated dynamic really is.     By Christian Markle Published 10 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Season 1 of Ranking of Kings, now streaming on Funimation. One of\u00a0Ranking of Kings' best assets is its unique and varied set of characters. None of them is inherently good or bad; they are merely motivated by their personal goals or by the needs of others. While the anime has made\u00a0some relationships clear -- like Hiling's motherly affection toward both her children and Apeas' loyalty toward Miranjo -- Miranjo's relationship with King Bosse is left murky. Miranjo and King Bosse are clearly on each other's side. Miranjo has done her best to support and ensure the fulfillment of King Bosse's wishes,\u00a0while King Bosse has followed Miranjo's lead, no matter how sinister her plans are. Even so, it's unclear whether they view each other as lovers, parent and child, or merely allies to.  RELATED:Ranking of Kings: How Do Bojji\u2019s Overpowered Fighting Skills Work?                  When Miranjo was introduced, she seemed like King Bosse's secret lover. She manipulated Daida in order to let King Bosse possess his body and return from the dead. By doing so, they could be together while King Bosse also\u00a0returned to his status as the strongest. While this supports the lover narrative, their actions prove otherwise. Miranjo and King Bosse never romantically engaged with each other, even when Miranjo still had her human body. Another argument against this is that Miranjo set up King Bosse for marriage, not just once but twice. It can be argued she did it for King Bosse's sake, but -- as deranged as it sounds -- she could have borne the second child instead of setting him up with Hiling. Another possibility is that they see one another as surrogate parent and child, and this may be partly true. After Bosse saved the young Miranjo from Gyakuzas, the two began adventuring together. Miranjo initially felt deep sorrow from her losses, but she eventually warmed up toward Bosse. She took it upon herself to make the giant stronger and find new challenges to keep him happy. Meanwhile, Bosse provided for Miranjo's necessities,\u00a0 and also kept her safe. The two have acted\u00a0as a parent and child to a certain degree, although their relationship is more than that, especially considering King Bosse has offered both of his children as pawns for her plots. RELATED:How Ranking of Kings Challenges Classic Western Fairy Tales - and Wins                   Perhaps what describes their relationship best is a mutual feeling of indebtedness, which then manifests as servitude. Being saved by the giant, who then showed her the beauties of the world, Miranjo feels she owes Bosse. She formulated all of her heinous plans because she believed it would make him happy. During Bosse's battle with Miranjo's father, both he and his opponent suffered severe injuries. Miranjo's mother nursed the giant back to health, and the giant took a liking to the young Miranjo and allied himself with the Houma during their fight against the Gods. However, his next meeting with Miranjo was when the young girl already lost everything and was being tortured by the Gyakuza. The giant then took it upon himself to return her lost smile, no matter the cost. Because both of them feel the need to prioritize\u00a0the other's happiness, the other tends to overcompensate, thus resulting in a downward spiral. It only stopped when Bosse almost attacked Miranjo, hoping to take her with him to the afterlife. That's the moment Miranjo realized that Bosse's happiness doesn't lie in being resurrected, ultimately changing her attitude toward life and Bosse. Fortunately, Daida was there to pick her up and save her before she succumbs to the darkness of being alone, so she ultimately becomes Bosse's daughter-in-law in a complicated twist of fate.

By Hayley McCullough Published 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The last episode of\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2\u00a0has premiered in Japan, but the series isn't going away anytime soon.\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 3\u00a0has officially been announced alongside its premiere window. A short trailer was uploaded on Twitter, confirming that the wildly popular anime will return sometime in 2023. Little information about possible story beats can be gleaned from the trailer itself as it only shows several characters standing in what appears to be a titan's footprint. However, manga readers may\u00a0have an idea of what the anime has in store;\u00a0Part 2's\u00a0episodes made it to roughly Chapter 130 of the manga, meaning there are nine chapters left of creator Hajime Isayama's\u00a0story to adapt.

It was well-received by both fans and critics upon release; the manga has sold over 100 million copies and won multiple awards, including\u00a0Best Sh\u014dnen Manga at the Kodansha Manga Awards in 2011. Isayama's\u00a0story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans hide from giant monsters (aka Titans) in walled cities. It follows the journey of Eren Yeager, a young man who vows to wipe out all of the Titans after they destroy his home and one devours his mother. While Eren is no doubt one of\u00a0Attack on Titan's main characters, many have argued that he has transitioned from a hero to a villain as the plot has unfolded. RELATED:\u00a0Universal Studios Previews New Attack on Titan, Sailor Moon Attractions While the news that\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season\u00a0is returning for a third part is exciting, the announcement isn't wholly surprising. Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2\u00a0premiered in January 2022 and ran for 12 episodes. Prior to the finale's debut, many speculated about\u00a0Part 2's ability to satisfyingly wrap up the apocalypse-level struggle between Eren and his former comrades in a single episode with some fans predicting that the anime's story would conclude in a tie-in movie. While MAPPA, the studio behind\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season, hasn't made any definitive announcements about\u00a0Part 3's creative team, it seems likely that Yuichiro Hayashi, the director behind\u00a0Part 1\u00a0and\u00a0Part 2, will return to finish off the project. In a recent interview, Hayashi explained his experiences with\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season, stating \"after I finished Part 1, I went on to direct Part 2, and I felt I had become much more familiar with Attack on Titan, so I think I've been able to direct more comfortably.\" KEEP READING:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan Source: Twitter      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                   Electrifying Pok\u00e9mon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech    Related Topics  Anime attack on titan (tv)     About The Author                       Hayley McCullough                                         (435 Articles Published)   Hayley is a News Writer for CBR.

By Hayley McCullough Published 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The last episode of\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2\u00a0has premiered in Japan, but the series isn't going away anytime soon.\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 3\u00a0has officially been announced alongside its premiere window. A short trailer was uploaded on Twitter, confirming that the wildly popular anime will return sometime in 2023. Little information about possible story beats can be gleaned from the trailer itself as it only shows several characters standing in what appears to be a titan's footprint. However, manga readers may\u00a0have an idea of what the anime has in store;\u00a0Part 2's\u00a0episodes made it to roughly Chapter 130 of the manga, meaning there are nine chapters left of creator Hajime Isayama's\u00a0story to adapt.

It was well-received by both fans and critics upon release; the manga has sold over 100 million copies and won multiple awards, including\u00a0Best Sh\u014dnen Manga at the Kodansha Manga Awards in 2011. Isayama's\u00a0story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans hide from giant monsters (aka Titans) in walled cities. It follows the journey of Eren Yeager, a young man who vows to wipe out all of the Titans after they destroy his home and one devours his mother. While Eren is no doubt one of\u00a0Attack on Titan's main characters, many have argued that he has transitioned from a hero to a villain as the plot has unfolded. RELATED:\u00a0Universal Studios Previews New Attack on Titan, Sailor Moon Attractions While the news that\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season\u00a0is returning for a third part is exciting, the announcement isn't wholly surprising. Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2\u00a0premiered in January 2022 and ran for 12 episodes. Prior to the finale's debut, many speculated about\u00a0Part 2's ability to satisfyingly wrap up the apocalypse-level struggle between Eren and his former comrades in a single episode with some fans predicting that the anime's story would conclude in a tie-in movie. While MAPPA, the studio behind\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season, hasn't made any definitive announcements about\u00a0Part 3's creative team, it seems likely that Yuichiro Hayashi, the director behind\u00a0Part 1\u00a0and\u00a0Part 2, will return to finish off the project. In a recent interview, Hayashi explained his experiences with\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season, stating \"after I finished Part 1, I went on to direct Part 2, and I felt I had become much more familiar with Attack on Titan, so I think I've been able to direct more comfortably.\" KEEP READING:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan Source: Twitter      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                   Electrifying Pok\u00e9mon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech    Related Topics  Anime attack on titan (tv)     About The Author                       Hayley McCullough                                         (435 Articles Published)   Hayley is a News Writer for CBR.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 14 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Though most recent fantasy anime with ridiculously long titles are isekai, they're not the only ones with these weird monikers.\u00a0Is It Wrong to Try To Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon?, also known simply\u00a0as\u00a0DanMachi, is one of the most ludicrous sounding shows around, though it has the popularity to back up the tongue-twister. With numerous spinoffs and adaptations in different mediums, traversing the franchise can feel like being in a dungeon itself. Thankfully, those who can't get enough of going to the dangerous dungeon are in luck, as the books and anime are far easier to get into. On top of that, more is on the way, so now's the best time to discover why fans love\u00a0DanMachi.  RELATED:\u00a0Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga The Plot of Is It Wrong to Try To Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon?                  The world of\u00a0Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon? is a city called Orario, which is home to countless gods and goddesses. These powerful supernatural beings have sought to somewhat limit their power in order to challenge themselves by living among the mortals. Life in Orario is especially hard for these normal people, though they make their days go by more easily by pledging themselves to certain gods. The sole patron of the Hestia Familia is the protagonist Bell Cranel, who wishes to be an expert adventurer. Unfortunately for Bell, the life of such an adventurer is hard and deadly indeed, with anyone venturing into the cavernous \"Dungeon\" risking life and limb for fortune and glory. Still, Bell trudges on, due to the inspiration given to him by his crush, a female sword master named Ais. Thankfully, he's got quite a harem of lovely ladies wanting to be by his side during his quest -- including the goddess Hestia herself. RELATED:\u00a0How to Get Started With Bakuman Where to Read the DanMachi Manga and Light Novels                  DanMachi began as a light novel from Fujino Omori and Suzuhito Yasuda, though the former originally tried writing it as a story called\u00a0Familia Myth. The first volume came out in January 2013 and\u00a0the series remains ongoing, with 17\u00a0in total so far. A spinoff light novel series based around Ais titled\u00a0Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? On the Side: Sword Oratoria began a year after the original, and it's got 12 volumes so far. 2017 saw the release of the side story spinoff\u00a0Familia Chronicle, which is adjacent to both of the others. All of these books would go on to receive manga adaptations, along with special stories for the characters Lyu and Freya. With the exception of the most recent volumes, all of the manga and light novels in the\u00a0DanMachi series have been brought over to the West by Yen Press.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 14 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Though most recent fantasy anime with ridiculously long titles are isekai, they're not the only ones with these weird monikers.\u00a0Is It Wrong to Try To Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon?, also known simply\u00a0as\u00a0DanMachi, is one of the most ludicrous sounding shows around, though it has the popularity to back up the tongue-twister. With numerous spinoffs and adaptations in different mediums, traversing the franchise can feel like being in a dungeon itself. Thankfully, those who can't get enough of going to the dangerous dungeon are in luck, as the books and anime are far easier to get into. On top of that, more is on the way, so now's the best time to discover why fans love\u00a0DanMachi.  RELATED:\u00a0Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga The Plot of Is It Wrong to Try To Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon?                  The world of\u00a0Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls In a Dungeon? is a city called Orario, which is home to countless gods and goddesses. These powerful supernatural beings have sought to somewhat limit their power in order to challenge themselves by living among the mortals. Life in Orario is especially hard for these normal people, though they make their days go by more easily by pledging themselves to certain gods. The sole patron of the Hestia Familia is the protagonist Bell Cranel, who wishes to be an expert adventurer. Unfortunately for Bell, the life of such an adventurer is hard and deadly indeed, with anyone venturing into the cavernous \"Dungeon\" risking life and limb for fortune and glory. Still, Bell trudges on, due to the inspiration given to him by his crush, a female sword master named Ais. Thankfully, he's got quite a harem of lovely ladies wanting to be by his side during his quest -- including the goddess Hestia herself. RELATED:\u00a0How to Get Started With Bakuman Where to Read the DanMachi Manga and Light Novels                  DanMachi began as a light novel from Fujino Omori and Suzuhito Yasuda, though the former originally tried writing it as a story called\u00a0Familia Myth. The first volume came out in January 2013 and\u00a0the series remains ongoing, with 17\u00a0in total so far. A spinoff light novel series based around Ais titled\u00a0Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? On the Side: Sword Oratoria began a year after the original, and it's got 12 volumes so far. 2017 saw the release of the side story spinoff\u00a0Familia Chronicle, which is adjacent to both of the others. All of these books would go on to receive manga adaptations, along with special stories for the characters Lyu and Freya. With the exception of the most recent volumes, all of the manga and light novels in the\u00a0DanMachi series have been brought over to the West by Yen Press. They can be found in the usual places, with physical stores like Barnes & Noble, Books-a-Million and even Walmart carrying them. They can also be ordered on Amazon, Right Stuf Anime and digitally through Kindle and Comixology.

Not only did she find out that Chizuru is a rental girlfriend, but she blackmailed Kazuya with the information and insisted on becoming his actual girlfriend. This makes her come off as a little pushy, but she has her reasons. Unfortunately, Season 1 of\u00a0Rent-A-Girlfriend\u00a0didn't really elaborate on what drives Ruka to such extremes. There are small hints sprinkled throughout the second half of the season, but none of them are fully explained. Season 2, however, may provide the opportunity to expand on Ruka and her motives. Here's what Season 1 implies about Ruka and what more there is to say about it in Season 2 and beyond.  RELATED:\u00a05 Great Manga for Harem Fans                  One of the\u00a0most notable habits of\u00a0Ruka is checking her heartbeat. Whenever something potentially exciting happens, especially between her and Kazuya, she consults her heart monitor. Her goal is to reach at least 90bpm (beats per minute); when she's with Kazuya, that goal is reached and even surpassed. This ability of Kazuya to make Ruka's heart\u00a0race is what attracts her to him. When Ruka was confronted about her approach to Kazuya by Chizuru, she said it wasn't something she would understand. This is interesting as it implies a very personal reason for pursuing Kazuya, something she's not comfortable sharing. Once her reasons are revealed, they will likely add another layer of drama to the anime to keep audiences hooked. RELATED:\u00a0Rent-A-Girlfriend Drops Season 2 Teaser Trailer and Art Ruka's cause for pursuing Kazuya was actually heavily hinted at during the end credits sequence of episode 7, \"Provisional Girlfriend and Girlfriend.\" There were shots of a young Ruka consulting a doctor, avoiding strenuous activities, riding a rollercoaster, being a rental girlfriend,\u00a0checking her heart rate with each\u00a0client, and meeting Kazuya. Some of these scenes have dialogue written down, but nothing too revealing. As it turns out, most of the scenes from this sequence were taken straight from Chapter 28 of the manga,\u00a0\"The \u2018Girlfriend\u2019, Ruka Sarashina.\" As a child, Ruka was diagnosed with a medical condition that makes her heartbeat slower than average. She sought to elevate it with exciting activities, which eventually led to her looking for potential lovers among her rental girlfriend clients. She cried tears of joy over Kazuya because he was the only one to get her heart rate as high as he did. Most of this\u00a0can be inferred from the Episode 7 ending, but it would still be nice to have the full scenes animated. RELATED:\u00a0Rent-A-Girlfriend: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga                   Chapter 28\u00a0has every right to be fully animated. As the anime suggests, the events of this chapter fall somewhere between episodes 7 and 8. Since this was only a one-cour season (~12 episodes), it's possible that this chapter was\u00a0heavily trimmed to save on runtime. Season 2 could provide the necessary opportunity to elaborate on the events shown in the end credits sequence and give them their due attention. Ruka's backstory definitely needs to be covered in more detail. It's crucial information for understanding her motives and desires. As nice as the end credits sequence is, it doesn't do the character justice. Properly explaining what compels her will add to the drama of the main story and garner her proper sympathy from the audience for her extreme measures. If Ruka is properly fleshed out by the anime, she could become even more of a fan favorite than she already is.

RELATED:\u00a05 Great Manga for Harem Fans                  One of the\u00a0most notable habits of\u00a0Ruka is checking her heartbeat. Whenever something potentially exciting happens, especially between her and Kazuya, she consults her heart monitor. Her goal is to reach at least 90bpm (beats per minute); when she's with Kazuya, that goal is reached and even surpassed. This ability of Kazuya to make Ruka's heart\u00a0race is what attracts her to him. When Ruka was confronted about her approach to Kazuya by Chizuru, she said it wasn't something she would understand. This is interesting as it implies a very personal reason for pursuing Kazuya, something she's not comfortable sharing. Once her reasons are revealed, they will likely add another layer of drama to the anime to keep audiences hooked. RELATED:\u00a0Rent-A-Girlfriend Drops Season 2 Teaser Trailer and Art Ruka's cause for pursuing Kazuya was actually heavily hinted at during the end credits sequence of episode 7, \"Provisional Girlfriend and Girlfriend.\" There were shots of a young Ruka consulting a doctor, avoiding strenuous activities, riding a rollercoaster, being a rental girlfriend,\u00a0checking her heart rate with each\u00a0client, and meeting Kazuya. Some of these scenes have dialogue written down, but nothing too revealing. As it turns out, most of the scenes from this sequence were taken straight from Chapter 28 of the manga,\u00a0\"The \u2018Girlfriend\u2019, Ruka Sarashina.\" As a child, Ruka was diagnosed with a medical condition that makes her heartbeat slower than average. She sought to elevate it with exciting activities, which eventually led to her looking for potential lovers among her rental girlfriend clients. She cried tears of joy over Kazuya because he was the only one to get her heart rate as high as he did. Most of this\u00a0can be inferred from the Episode 7 ending, but it would still be nice to have the full scenes animated. RELATED:\u00a0Rent-A-Girlfriend: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga                   Chapter 28\u00a0has every right to be fully animated. As the anime suggests, the events of this chapter fall somewhere between episodes 7 and 8. Since this was only a one-cour season (~12 episodes), it's possible that this chapter was\u00a0heavily trimmed to save on runtime. Season 2 could provide the necessary opportunity to elaborate on the events shown in the end credits sequence and give them their due attention. Ruka's backstory definitely needs to be covered in more detail. It's crucial information for understanding her motives and desires. As nice as the end credits sequence is, it doesn't do the character justice. Properly explaining what compels her will add to the drama of the main story and garner her proper sympathy from the audience for her extreme measures. If Ruka is properly fleshed out by the anime, she could become even more of a fan favorite than she already is.

Why Was Southern Cross' 'Robotech' Season Such a Flop? Though it's tangentially related to the mecha classic Macross, Southern Cross failed due to bad designs, a rushed production and a lack of toys.     By Timothy Donohoo Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Many anime fans still fondly remember the series\u00a0Macross from back in the 1980s, or perhaps they've seen the numerous sequels it's spawned. Western fans might be more familiar with the American adaptation\u00a0Robotech, which is well known in its own way. Though most of the shows related to\u00a0Macross became hits, one \"sequel\"\u00a0went on to be anything but. Southern Cross was the third entry in the \"Super Dimension\" trilogy that included\u00a0Macross, though it's universally considered to be the worst one. This reception reflects a hellish production history, a surprising lack of merchandise and an even more ironic second chance through\u00a0Robotech. Here's why anime fans have rarely experienced \"deja vu\" when thinking back on\u00a0Southern Cross.  RELATED:\u00a0Gundam OO Returns With New Spinoff, Revealed Chronicle What Was the Southern Cross Anime?                  Southern Cross is set in the futuristic year of 2120, where humanity has taken to the stars in order to colonize other worlds. Defending the human race is the Southern Cross army, who pilot powerful vehicles and mechanized armor. Their latest colony is the world of Glorie, which was once populated by the alien race known as the Zor. The two species quickly come into conflict with each other, and their war isn't unlike the battle between humanity and the Zentradi in\u00a0Macross. Southern Cross began as a concept by controversial artist Aki Uchiyama, who was known for his salacious, adult-oriented art. This\u00a0series was going to feature female historical figures in a comedy of sorts, including Joan of Arc. Eventually, it was decided to drop the lolita aspect of the concept's characters, make them older and put them in a science fiction/fantasy setting. To make this change complete, staff from the classic mecha series Aura Battler Dunbine was brought over, but when that show's medieval setting failed to connect with audiences,\u00a0it\u00a0presented a problem. Thus, the show finally became a pure sci-fi mecha series that was able to secure the \"Super Dimension\" moniker from sponsor Big West. This didn't mean it was a sequel to The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, however -- it simply shared a similar prefix like the second Super Dimension series, Orguss. In fact, Macross is even referenced as a show within the universe of Southern Cross. RELATED:\u00a0How to Get Started With Mobile Suit Gundam Why Wasn't Southern Cross Successful Like Macross?                  Unfortunately, much of the other staff\u00a0weren't used to animated complex mecha designs, resulting in Southern Cross having some outright horrid-looking giant robots. Given that it was, in fact, a mecha series, these unflattering designs were a deterrent. It didn't help that, ironically enough,\u00a0Southern Cross didn't have much in the way of official merchandise. Though there were some products, none of these amounted to a line of mech toys or model kits such as those for Macross or the\u00a0Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. The biggest batch of salt in the wound was the fact that Matchbox produced toys based on the series' mechas when footage from\u00a0Southern Cross was used in the \"Masters Saga\" of\u00a0Robotech. This saw Japan importing the American toys for Southern Cross\u00a0as they had none of their own, all the while reversing the situation for the first part of\u00a0Robotech, where legal entanglements prevented American toy companies from importing Japanese\u00a0Macross toys. RELATED: Gundam Debuts First Look at New Anime Series, The Witch From Mercury Another big issue was that\u00a0Southern Cross was a rush job that had to be produced quickly to be a time slot follow-up to Orguss. Further deterring its success was the pending release of the\u00a0Macross movie,\u00a0Do You Remember Love?. There was much more advertisement for this than\u00a0Southern Cross, keeping the first\u00a0Super Dimension series in the public eye while downplaying the newest one. This was probably deserved, since the series wasn't exactly great. Its intended 32 episodes were cut down to 23, so its story had to be truncated to a horribly paced degree. Plots and concepts are introduced but quickly dropped, and the characters aren't much better. The show also failed to get the crossover success of Macross due to a combination of\u00a0lethargic\u00a0action by way of\u00a0even poorer robot designs, as well as none of the great romance\u00a0Macross was known for. The love stories in Southern Cross, if they can even be called that, are shallow and poorly developed, and it doesn't help that the main character is a bit of an annoying airhead. With all these issues combined,\u00a0Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross came and went in 1984. The best thing to come out of the series was its admittedly decent music, namely the hip intro song \"Hoshi no Deja Vu\" by Yoko Katori. It can be streamed through Tubi TV, though it's only really worth it for the most die-hard of\u00a0Macross or mecha anime fans.

Though it's tangentially related to the mecha classic Macross, Southern Cross failed due to bad designs, a rushed production and a lack of toys.     By Timothy Donohoo Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Many anime fans still fondly remember the series\u00a0Macross from back in the 1980s, or perhaps they've seen the numerous sequels it's spawned. Western fans might be more familiar with the American adaptation\u00a0Robotech, which is well known in its own way. Though most of the shows related to\u00a0Macross became hits, one \"sequel\"\u00a0went on to be anything but. Southern Cross was the third entry in the \"Super Dimension\" trilogy that included\u00a0Macross, though it's universally considered to be the worst one. This reception reflects a hellish production history, a surprising lack of merchandise and an even more ironic second chance through\u00a0Robotech. Here's why anime fans have rarely experienced \"deja vu\" when thinking back on\u00a0Southern Cross.  RELATED:\u00a0Gundam OO Returns With New Spinoff, Revealed Chronicle What Was the Southern Cross Anime?                  Southern Cross is set in the futuristic year of 2120, where humanity has taken to the stars in order to colonize other worlds. Defending the human race is the Southern Cross army, who pilot powerful vehicles and mechanized armor. Their latest colony is the world of Glorie, which was once populated by the alien race known as the Zor. The two species quickly come into conflict with each other, and their war isn't unlike the battle between humanity and the Zentradi in\u00a0Macross. Southern Cross began as a concept by controversial artist Aki Uchiyama, who was known for his salacious, adult-oriented art. This\u00a0series was going to feature female historical figures in a comedy of sorts, including Joan of Arc. Eventually, it was decided to drop the lolita aspect of the concept's characters, make them older and put them in a science fiction/fantasy setting. To make this change complete, staff from the classic mecha series Aura Battler Dunbine was brought over, but when that show's medieval setting failed to connect with audiences,\u00a0it\u00a0presented a problem. Thus, the show finally became a pure sci-fi mecha series that was able to secure the \"Super Dimension\" moniker from sponsor Big West. This didn't mean it was a sequel to The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, however -- it simply shared a similar prefix like the second Super Dimension series, Orguss. In fact, Macross is even referenced as a show within the universe of Southern Cross. RELATED:\u00a0How to Get Started With Mobile Suit Gundam Why Wasn't Southern Cross Successful Like Macross?                  Unfortunately, much of the other staff\u00a0weren't used to animated complex mecha designs, resulting in Southern Cross having some outright horrid-looking giant robots. Given that it was, in fact, a mecha series, these unflattering designs were a deterrent. It didn't help that, ironically enough,\u00a0Southern Cross didn't have much in the way of official merchandise. Though there were some products, none of these amounted to a line of mech toys or model kits such as those for Macross or the\u00a0Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. The biggest batch of salt in the wound was the fact that Matchbox produced toys based on the series' mechas when footage from\u00a0Southern Cross was used in the \"Masters Saga\" of\u00a0Robotech. This saw Japan importing the American toys for Southern Cross\u00a0as they had none of their own, all the while reversing the situation for the first part of\u00a0Robotech, where legal entanglements prevented American toy companies from importing Japanese\u00a0Macross toys. RELATED: Gundam Debuts First Look at New Anime Series, The Witch From Mercury Another big issue was that\u00a0Southern Cross was a rush job that had to be produced quickly to be a time slot follow-up to Orguss. Further deterring its success was the pending release of the\u00a0Macross movie,\u00a0Do You Remember Love?. There was much more advertisement for this than\u00a0Southern Cross, keeping the first\u00a0Super Dimension series in the public eye while downplaying the newest one. This was probably deserved, since the series wasn't exactly great. Its intended 32 episodes were cut down to 23, so its story had to be truncated to a horribly paced degree. Plots and concepts are introduced but quickly dropped, and the characters aren't much better. The show also failed to get the crossover success of Macross due to a combination of\u00a0lethargic\u00a0action by way of\u00a0even poorer robot designs, as well as none of the great romance\u00a0Macross was known for. The love stories in Southern Cross, if they can even be called that, are shallow and poorly developed, and it doesn't help that the main character is a bit of an annoying airhead. With all these issues combined,\u00a0Super Dimension Calvary Southern Cross came and went in 1984. The best thing to come out of the series was its admittedly decent music, namely the hip intro song \"Hoshi no Deja Vu\" by Yoko Katori. It can be streamed through Tubi TV, though it's only really worth it for the most die-hard of\u00a0Macross or mecha anime fans.

One of the best aspects of this particular system is the ability to use Domain Expansion,\u00a0said to be the peak of Jujutsu Sorcery. It's not a common skill among Jujutsu society, although recent events in the Culling Game may have fans thinking it is. Some of the most skilled sorcerers, like Kento Nanami, haven't been able to reach this level of Sorcery. The fact that the Culling Game has already shown five different characters cast their Domain Expansions (or at least attempt to) is more a testament to how powerful these players are. A sorcerer using their Domain Expansion usually means victory, thanks to their attacks hitting the target being guaranteed. However, not all Domains work like this, as seen with Hiromi Higuruma's Deadly Sentencing.  RELATED:\u00a0Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Delivers a Thrilling & Emotional Prequel That Fans Will Love                  When two sorcerers cast their Domain Expansions in the same space, usually the more powerful Domain will overwhelm the weaker one. The latter will ultimately break and only the stronger one will remain. Gojo Satoru proved this in his fight against Jogo. However, it gets a bit more complicated when it's three Domains instead of just two. In Chapter 179 of Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuta, Uro and Ishigori all try to cast their Domain Expansions at the same time -- and it doesn't go as planned for any of them. When Domains overlap, the can't-miss attacks actually cancel each other out. Moreover, as they attempt to erect their barriers, the required internal and external conditions required differ for each one. As if that didn't make the situation difficult enough, an unexpected invader suddenly intrudes. RELATED:\u00a0Jujutsu Kaisen: Yuta's Selflessness Is a Virtue - But It Could Get Him Killed                  Kurourishi had apparently reproduced by parthenogenesis before Yuta killed him in Chapter 175. After the original was exorcised, the Cursed Energy of fear throughout Japan was poured into the child. Thus, a new Kurourushi -- just as strong as the previous one -- was created. Its sudden invasion into the clashing Domain barriers, combined with their differing conditions, causes all three barriers to completely break. No new Domain Expansions were actually seen in Chapter 179, but Jujutsu Kaisen readers\u00a0still learned some new details. Interestingly, this new information does raise a question regarding Sukuna's Malevolent Shrine, which is unlike any other Domain Expansion seen so far. It doesn't create a separate space using a relatively small barrier but instead covers a radius of nearly 200 meters. What would happen if Sukuna's Domain Expansion clashed against two others? It seems plausible to assume that his would easily overwhelm any others, but this remains to be seen as the manga continues.

It was boring so I decided to write about things I love. On the geek side of things, I write about comics, cartoons, video games, television, movies and basically, all things nerdy. I also write about music in terms of punk, indie, hardcore and emo because well, they rock! If you're bored by now, then you also don't want to hear that I write for ESPN on the PR side of things. And yes, I've written sports for them too! Not bad for someone from the Caribbean, eh? To top all this off, I've scribed short films and documentaries, conceptualizing stories and scripts from a human interest and social justice perspective. Business-wise, I make big cheddar (not really) as a copywriter and digital strategist working with some of the top brands in the Latin America region. In closing, let me remind you that the geek shall inherit the Earth. Oh, FYI, I'd love to write the Gargoyles movie for Disney. YOLO. That said, I'm on Twitter @RenaldoMatadeen.

Throughout the sprawling story of\u00a0Naruto, very few people have been able to contend with Sasuke Uchiha. Orochimaru and Itachi couldn't best him, while many would call his war against Naruto a draw. The Uchiha shinobi later\u00a0proved to be a thorn in the side of Madara, Kaguya and other \u014ctsutsuki aliens such as Isshiki, Momoshiki and Kinshiki. Sasuke is in a class of his own, which is why many anime and manga fans consider him one of the best characters ever. Admittedly,\u00a0Boruto\u00a0has depowered him by having him lose his Rinnegan in the field, but as the fans\u00a0know, Sasuke still has a ton of styles that make him a one-man army. However, come Chapter 68,\u00a0he may have finally found his\u00a0deadliest opponent yet.  RELATED:\u00a0How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment                  Sasuke was missing in action for some time, which is why he couldn't help out when Momoshiki took over Boruto and fought Kawaki in the Konoha forest. This led to Momoshiki having to resurrect Boruto to save his body after Kawaki powered up with his new Karma mark and mortally wounded\u00a0the Hokage's son. To top it off, Code posed a problem for a Kurama-less Naruto and Shikamaru, which left them missing\u00a0Sasuke more than ever. As is usual with this series, he reappeared after the drama with everyone recovering in Konoha, especially the revived Boruto. Thankfully no one else got badly injured,\u00a0but Sasuke made it clear there was no time to waste. The ranger discovered intel about a snow base Boro had under Isshiki and Kara, which Sasuke suspects has been hoarding weapons such as killer robots and other tech that could be as dangerous as Kawaki. But while he thinks it'll be basic shinobi guards like Bug and co. there, it's actually where Eida, the all-seeing bot, and her\u00a0younger brother Daemon are. As a result, when Sasuke arrives thinking it's Code's lair, he'll be in for a surprise. With\u00a0Eida and Code attacking Konoha, the Uchiha warrior could\u00a0use a jutsu to get to the lair to destroy it, only to come across the kid. The problem is, Daemon has reflective powers so anything Sasuke throws at him -- from the Katon fire techniques to his Chidori lightning blade --\u00a0will be hurled back automatically. RELATED: How Boruto Could Revive the Most Powerful Uchiha Shinobi - and It\u2019s Not Itachi                  It could be death in seconds, and the sad thing is that without his Rinnegan, Sasuke may not be able to detect anything. Daemon's added advantage is that no one\u00a0knows about him or this gift, so Sasuke won't even have a heads-up on just trying taijutsu to knock him out. Instead, when Sasuke raids, Daemon could provoke and lure him into this trap, taking him out instantly and showing the Hidden Leaf that dangerous things do come in small packages.\u00a0Boruto would be shaping Daemon up as the destroyer Eida teased, and even if he's left alive, it'll prove Sasuke is as vulnerable and human as ever.

It was boring so I decided to write about things I love. On the geek side of things, I write about comics, cartoons, video games, television, movies and basically, all things nerdy. I also write about music in terms of punk, indie, hardcore and emo because well, they rock! If you're bored by now, then you also don't want to hear that I write for ESPN on the PR side of things. And yes, I've written sports for them too! Not bad for someone from the Caribbean, eh? To top all this off, I've scribed short films and documentaries, conceptualizing stories and scripts from a human interest and social justice perspective. Business-wise, I make big cheddar (not really) as a copywriter and digital strategist working with some of the top brands in the Latin America region. In closing, let me remind you that the geek shall inherit the Earth. Oh, FYI, I'd love to write the Gargoyles movie for Disney. YOLO. That said, I'm on Twitter @RenaldoMatadeen. So holler.
