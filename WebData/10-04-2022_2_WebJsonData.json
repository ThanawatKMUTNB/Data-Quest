RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul The series opens with the unassuming protagonist Yuuichi Katakiri and his tight-knit student friend group. This posse consists of the carefree rich boy Makoto Shibe, the stern vice class representative Shiho Sawaragi, the prodigious smart guy Tenji Mikasa and the caring wallflower Yutori Kokorogi. While the five share a deep bond, suspicion arises around them after two million yen is stolen from the class' school trip funds.  Following this incident, all five of them receive a letter in the middle of the night to meet at the school, at which point they are accosted and kidnapped. After waking up in a bleached white room, they are informed by Manabu-kun, an eerie childlike mascot character, that they must play a series of games to pay off a 20 million yen sum -- a debt that supposedly belongs to one of them. Although Yuuichi initially doubts the reality of the setup, he is shocked when the other four quickly accede to these demands. His horror is further reinforced by Manabu-kun's mention of an entry fee paid by the debtor equal to the exact amount stolen from the class.                  It is this looming sense of secrecy that creates a unique tension to the elements of Tomodachi Game. The anime masterfully conveys the events from Yuuichi's perspective alone, secluding audiences from the other four in the same way that Yuuichi himself is during the games. All five of them become equally saddled with the divided debt at the start of the contest, despite only one of them being responsible for its existence. Furthermore, the activities are structured in such a way that the amount owed by each character can go up or down based on their actions but is never verified by another participant.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man, Look Back Creator Announces New Feature-Length Manga The first game, based on Kokkuri-san -- the Japanese equivalent of a ouija board -- makes the players communally answer a series of yes-or-no questions by moving a coin around without talking. The board itself, programmed to move in the direction of the minority answer, initially seems to be a largely innocuous hurdle. Still, once the seemingly simple questions come back consistently incorrect, it seems like sabotage may be the only explanation.                 Many viewers have compared the show to death game series like Alice in Borderland or Squid Game. The latter parallel appears particularly apt due to the promise of prize money to settle a massive debt. Additionally, Squid Game's bouts for survival are largely based around childhood pastimes. Tomodachi Game's Kokkuri-san certainly fits the bill for that genre of activity, as does the presence of the unsettling Manabu-kun, who comes from a kid's anime within the world of Tomodachi Game.  RELATED: Spy x Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime Nevertheless, it is the relationship of the competitors that drives the pain of the scenario home. One would expect to be cast aside by rivals in a game where none of the members know each other. In contrast, Tomodachi Game attacks its characters' emotional foundation by confronting them with the reality of a traitor among their dearest friends. Likewise, by making the contest about money rather than death, it places them in a situation where the consequences are more morally gray. While the debt may be a dire consequence, it's much easier to force that upon a friend than it is to condemn them to death.                  That being said, there is no telling where future matches will take the group. The show has already revealed a shadowy organization behind the scenes, analyzing their every move. Should the five make it past this first round, they may be forced to wager more than just money as the limits of their bonds are tested. But no matter what comes of their collective trials, it's clear that the relationship between Yuuichi and his friends will never be the same again.

High-stakes games have become a commonplace narrative in anime, video games and live-action shows.

Tomodachi Game, one of this season's newest suspense series, delivers a similar structure by forcing high schoolers to play games with each other's fates on the line.  However, in comparison to many of its contemporaries, Tomodachi Game has two big differences.

Second, the participants are all people that they believed to be their best friends. RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul The series opens with the unassuming protagonist Yuuichi Katakiri and his tight-knit student friend group. This posse consists of the carefree rich boy Makoto Shibe, the stern vice class representative Shiho Sawaragi, the prodigious smart guy Tenji Mikasa and the caring wallflower Yutori Kokorogi. While the five share a deep bond, suspicion arises around them after two million yen is stolen from the class' school trip funds.  Following this incident, all five of them receive a letter in the middle of the night to meet at the school, at which point they are accosted and kidnapped. After waking up in a bleached white room, they are informed by Manabu-kun, an eerie childlike mascot character, that they must play a series of games to pay off a 20 million yen sum -- a debt that supposedly belongs to one of them. Although Yuuichi initially doubts the reality of the setup, he is shocked when the other four quickly accede to these demands. His horror is further reinforced by Manabu-kun's mention of an entry fee paid by the debtor equal to the exact amount stolen from the class.                  It is this looming sense of secrecy that creates a unique tension to the elements of Tomodachi Game. The anime masterfully conveys the events from Yuuichi's perspective alone, secluding audiences from the other four in the same way that Yuuichi himself is during the games. All five of them become equally saddled with the divided debt at the start of the contest, despite only one of them being responsible for its existence. Furthermore, the activities are structured in such a way that the amount owed by each character can go up or down based on their actions but is never verified by another participant.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man, Look Back Creator Announces New Feature-Length Manga The first game, based on Kokkuri-san -- the Japanese equivalent of a ouija board -- makes the players communally answer a series of yes-or-no questions by moving a coin around without talking. The board itself, programmed to move in the direction of the minority answer, initially seems to be a largely innocuous hurdle. Still, once the seemingly simple questions come back consistently incorrect, it seems like sabotage may be the only explanation.                 Many viewers have compared the show to death game series like Alice in Borderland or Squid Game. The latter parallel appears particularly apt due to the promise of prize money to settle a massive debt. Additionally, Squid Game's bouts for survival are largely based around childhood pastimes. Tomodachi Game's Kokkuri-san certainly fits the bill for that genre of activity, as does the presence of the unsettling Manabu-kun, who comes from a kid's anime within the world of Tomodachi Game.  RELATED: Spy x Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime Nevertheless, it is the relationship of the competitors that drives the pain of the scenario home. One would expect to be cast aside by rivals in a game where none of the members know each other. In contrast, Tomodachi Game attacks its characters' emotional foundation by confronting them with the reality of a traitor among their dearest friends. Likewise, by making the contest about money rather than death, it places them in a situation where the consequences are more morally gray. While the debt may be a dire consequence, it's much easier to force that upon a friend than it is to condemn them to death.                  That being said, there is no telling where future matches will take the group. The show has already revealed a shadowy organization behind the scenes, analyzing their every move. Should the five make it past this first round, they may be forced to wager more than just money as the limits of their bonds are tested. But no matter what comes of their collective trials, it's clear that the relationship between Yuuichi and his friends will never be the same again.

Fans of the up-and-coming shonen manga Chainsaw Man are in for a surprise with Chapter 59. Readers attempting to use the Shonen Jump app to read the latest chapter are with a disclaimer: \"Chapter 59 of Chainsaw Man is 18+ and viewable on the website only.\" Prevsious chapters had been appropriate for younger readers, so why the sudden restriction?  Chainsaw Man follows Denji, a destitute young man that fuses his heart with a type of monster called a Devil. In doing so, he gains the ability to sprout functioning chainsaws from his head and arms. However, he also loses all of his human rights and is forced to become a government Devil hunter or else be exterminated. Chainsaw Man has a track record of being graphically bloody and explicit. As a title, it has never shied away from gory or sexual content. It's almost a feature of the story, as the sheltered Denji discovers that the people around him are just as messed up as he is. RELATED: Chainsaw Man Puts a Bloody Spin on Adventure Time\u2019s Finn & Jake                 The scene that likely makes Chainsaw Man Chapter 59 \"web-only\" involves a recently introduced character named Quanxi. Currently, not much is known about her except for the fact that she's Chinese, upsettingly powerful and has a harem of Devil girls. Quanxi and a slew of other Devil hunters have traveled to Japan in a bid to kill Denji, though Quanxi seems to be procrastinating by spending time with her girls. The opening pages of Chapter 59 feature the hunter and the Devil girls, fully naked -- albeit with strategically covered lady parts -- and in the middle of a five-person orgy. And it's a two-page spread.  RELATED: First Dragon Ball English Dub Episode By Harmony Gold Is Now Online Even for Chainsaw Man, the scene is pretty intense for the normally tween-friendly Shonen Jump -- hence the move to Viz Media's website. Chainsaw Man is the latest in a range of action titles that delve into the explicit for thematic potency. Series like Kaneshiro Muneyuki's Jagaaaaan or Yuji Kaku's Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku -- another Jump series -- use harsh violence and explicit sexual situations to make points about the worlds their characters live in. And, though it's not a shonen title, another classic example of this would be Kentaro Miura's Berserk, infamous for its extremely graphic disposition.  While moving a chapter from app to site is certainly better than outright censorship, this situation is a gentle reminder that these titles don't exist in a vacuum, though many of us read them in one. They are part of a larger whole, and so still have to consider any audience that might stumble onto them.

Fans of the up-and-coming shonen manga Chainsaw Man are in for a surprise with Chapter 59. Readers attempting to use the Shonen Jump app to read the latest chapter are with a disclaimer: \"Chapter 59 of Chainsaw Man is 18+ and viewable on the website only.\" Prevsious chapters had been appropriate for younger readers, so why the sudden restriction?  Chainsaw Man follows Denji, a destitute young man that fuses his heart with a type of monster called a Devil. In doing so, he gains the ability to sprout functioning chainsaws from his head and arms. However, he also loses all of his human rights and is forced to become a government Devil hunter or else be exterminated. Chainsaw Man has a track record of being graphically bloody and explicit. As a title, it has never shied away from gory or sexual content. It's almost a feature of the story, as the sheltered Denji discovers that the people around him are just as messed up as he is. RELATED: Chainsaw Man Puts a Bloody Spin on Adventure Time\u2019s Finn & Jake                 The scene that likely makes Chainsaw Man Chapter 59 \"web-only\" involves a recently introduced character named Quanxi. Currently, not much is known about her except for the fact that she's Chinese, upsettingly powerful and has a harem of Devil girls. Quanxi and a slew of other Devil hunters have traveled to Japan in a bid to kill Denji, though Quanxi seems to be procrastinating by spending time with her girls. The opening pages of Chapter 59 feature the hunter and the Devil girls, fully naked -- albeit with strategically covered lady parts -- and in the middle of a five-person orgy. And it's a two-page spread.  RELATED: First Dragon Ball English Dub Episode By Harmony Gold Is Now Online Even for Chainsaw Man, the scene is pretty intense for the normally tween-friendly Shonen Jump -- hence the move to Viz Media's website. Chainsaw Man is the latest in a range of action titles that delve into the explicit for thematic potency. Series like Kaneshiro Muneyuki's Jagaaaaan or Yuji Kaku's Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku -- another Jump series -- use harsh violence and explicit sexual situations to make points about the worlds their characters live in. And, though it's not a shonen title, another classic example of this would be Kentaro Miura's Berserk, infamous for its extremely graphic disposition.  While moving a chapter from app to site is certainly better than outright censorship, this situation is a gentle reminder that these titles don't exist in a vacuum, though many of us read them in one. They are part of a larger whole, and so still have to consider any audience that might stumble onto them.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2.A talented fan of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan used special effects to transform himself into one of the series' titular monsters and then... ate himself.  Posted on the ProductionCrate YouTube channel, the creator, who identifies himself as Mike, walks viewers through the process of how he created the Titan-version of himself. He covers the many steps, including creating a 3D model of his head, the necessary color map and the uncanny proportions of the body. The video ends with a sequence of Titan-Mike chasing Human-Mike and biting his head off. While there is no blood, the sound effects give the action a gruesome, evocative edge. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Mikasa and Annie Debate Killing Eren in Exclusive Final Season Clip    Attack of Titan is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans hide from Titans -- giant, man-eating monsters -- in walled cities. The story focuses primarily on Eren Yeager, a young man who desires to destroy all Titans after one devours his mother. While early parts of the narrative appear to frame Eren as the hero, towards the end, he transitions to a full-blown, genocidal villain.  The Attack on Titan manga series was published in Kodansha's Bessatsu Sh\u014dnen Magazine from 2009 to 2021, and it won several prominent awards, including Best Sh\u014dnen Manga at the Kodansha Manga Awards in 2011. The story was adapted into an anime with the first season premiering in 2013. Wit Studio produced the first three seasons and MAPPA is creating the fourth and final season. RELATED: Attack on Titan Cosplayer Recreates Colossal Titan With Household Materials Attack on Titan: The Final Season has been split into multiple parts. Part 1 premiered in December 2020, Part 2 debuted in January 2022 and it was recently revealed that Attack on Titan: The Final Season would return in 2023 for a third part. While this news undoubtedly excited the anime's passionate fans, it wasn't wholly unexpected. Prior to the release of Part 2's finale, many questioned the anime's ability to satisfyingly wrap the story in a single episode.  There have been other developments in the Attack on Titan franchise apart from impressive works of fan-made content and the confirmation of Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 3. Most notably, the popular virtual rollercoaster based on the series, Attack on Titan XR Ride, which first ran in 2020, is returning for this year's Universal Cool Japan. The manga series was also one of the featured titles in the launch of MangaPlaza, one of the largest digital libraries in the US. Attack on Titan is available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Funimation and Crunchyroll.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2.A talented fan of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan used special effects to transform himself into one of the series' titular monsters and then... ate himself.  Posted on the ProductionCrate YouTube channel, the creator, who identifies himself as Mike, walks viewers through the process of how he created the Titan-version of himself. He covers the many steps, including creating a 3D model of his head, the necessary color map and the uncanny proportions of the body. The video ends with a sequence of Titan-Mike chasing Human-Mike and biting his head off. While there is no blood, the sound effects give the action a gruesome, evocative edge. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Mikasa and Annie Debate Killing Eren in Exclusive Final Season Clip    Attack of Titan is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humans hide from Titans -- giant, man-eating monsters -- in walled cities. The story focuses primarily on Eren Yeager, a young man who desires to destroy all Titans after one devours his mother. While early parts of the narrative appear to frame Eren as the hero, towards the end, he transitions to a full-blown, genocidal villain.  The Attack on Titan manga series was published in Kodansha's Bessatsu Sh\u014dnen Magazine from 2009 to 2021, and it won several prominent awards, including Best Sh\u014dnen Manga at the Kodansha Manga Awards in 2011. The story was adapted into an anime with the first season premiering in 2013. Wit Studio produced the first three seasons and MAPPA is creating the fourth and final season. RELATED: Attack on Titan Cosplayer Recreates Colossal Titan With Household Materials Attack on Titan: The Final Season has been split into multiple parts. Part 1 premiered in December 2020, Part 2 debuted in January 2022 and it was recently revealed that Attack on Titan: The Final Season would return in 2023 for a third part. While this news undoubtedly excited the anime's passionate fans, it wasn't wholly unexpected. Prior to the release of Part 2's finale, many questioned the anime's ability to satisfyingly wrap the story in a single episode.  There have been other developments in the Attack on Titan franchise apart from impressive works of fan-made content and the confirmation of Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 3. Most notably, the popular virtual rollercoaster based on the series, Attack on Titan XR Ride, which first ran in 2020, is returning for this year's Universal Cool Japan. The manga series was also one of the featured titles in the launch of MangaPlaza, one of the largest digital libraries in the US. Attack on Titan is available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Funimation and Crunchyroll.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

Home Movies Movie Features The Terrifying Legend That Inspired the Conjuring Universe's The Curse of La Llorona    The Terrifying Legend That Inspired the Conjuring Universe's The Curse of La Llorona  By Michael Li Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The sixth entry in The Conjuring franchise, The Curse of La Llorona, is special due to being based on a popular and terrifying Mexican legend                 Much like the other entries in The Conjuring Universe, The Curse of La Llorona is inspired by \"true\" events. However, unlike the other films, this entry is not based on one of Ed and Lorraine Warrens' ghostly adventures but rather on a popular Mexican legend, specifically the tale of La Llorona, otherwise known as \"The Weeping Woman.\"  According to the legend, a mother of two children drowns them after witnessing her wealthy husband being unfaithful to her. Racked by guilt, she then drowns herself but is unable to pass into the afterlife. As such, she is cursed to roam the world as a vengeful spirit, dressed in a white wedding gown while constantly wailing. Many claimed to have encountered La Llorona. While some say she kills all who go near her, others believe she only kills children by drowning them. RELATED: Best Horror Films To Watch On Shudder In April 2022                 The legend has its roots as far back as the 19th century in Mexico and parts of Central America. However, early recollections of the legend of La Llorona originated as a woman who was murdered by her husband. As time went by, the legend evolved to include the element of infanticide. Additionally, the legend shares parallels with Aztec, Greek and Hebrew legends that center on themes of fertility and motherhood.  While La Llorona in The Conjuring film franchise may seem similar to the myth counterpart because both wear white wedding gowns and have drowned their children, there are a few noticeable differences. Unlike the traditional legend, which deals with the themes of motherhood and fertility, the La Llorona legend in The Curse of La Llorona seems to be more of a cautionary tale for children not to disobey their parents or wander out too far at night. This is exemplified by children suffering burn marks after La Llorona grabs them by the arm. RELATED: Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out                  Additionally, the film introduced a method of bargaining with La Llorona, something not mentioned in the original legend. When Patricia's two sons are killed by La Llorona, Patricia bargains for her children back in exchange for Anna's two children. Besides this never before seen aspect, the film introduces a ritual that can be conducted to protect against La Llorona. However, according to the legend, La Llorona is said to not follow people into their houses or cars. Despite many movie watchers being introduced to La Llorona through the horror film The Curse of La Llorona, the film was actually inspired by a long-standing legend that many children in Mexico, Central America and parts of the southwest United States grew up listening to. While La Llorona herself is most likely not real, her legacy has and will continue to be told to the next generation as both a cautionary tale to stay away from unsafe waters and what it means to be a mother.

However, unlike the other films, this entry is not based on one of Ed and Lorraine Warrens' ghostly adventures but rather on a popular Mexican legend, specifically the tale of La Llorona, otherwise known as \"The Weeping Woman.\"  According to the legend, a mother of two children drowns them after witnessing her wealthy husband being unfaithful to her. Racked by guilt, she then drowns herself but is unable to pass into the afterlife. As such, she is cursed to roam the world as a vengeful spirit, dressed in a white wedding gown while constantly wailing. Many claimed to have encountered La Llorona. While some say she kills all who go near her, others believe she only kills children by drowning them. RELATED: Best Horror Films To Watch On Shudder In April 2022                 The legend has its roots as far back as the 19th century in Mexico and parts of Central America. However, early recollections of the legend of La Llorona originated as a woman who was murdered by her husband. As time went by, the legend evolved to include the element of infanticide. Additionally, the legend shares parallels with Aztec, Greek and Hebrew legends that center on themes of fertility and motherhood.  While La Llorona in The Conjuring film franchise may seem similar to the myth counterpart because both wear white wedding gowns and have drowned their children, there are a few noticeable differences. Unlike the traditional legend, which deals with the themes of motherhood and fertility, the La Llorona legend in The Curse of La Llorona seems to be more of a cautionary tale for children not to disobey their parents or wander out too far at night. This is exemplified by children suffering burn marks after La Llorona grabs them by the arm. RELATED: Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out                  Additionally, the film introduced a method of bargaining with La Llorona, something not mentioned in the original legend. When Patricia's two sons are killed by La Llorona, Patricia bargains for her children back in exchange for Anna's two children. Besides this never before seen aspect, the film introduces a ritual that can be conducted to protect against La Llorona. However, according to the legend, La Llorona is said to not follow people into their houses or cars. Despite many movie watchers being introduced to La Llorona through the horror film The Curse of La Llorona, the film was actually inspired by a long-standing legend that many children in Mexico, Central America and parts of the southwest United States grew up listening to. While La Llorona herself is most likely not real, her legacy has and will continue to be told to the next generation as both a cautionary tale to stay away from unsafe waters and what it means to be a mother.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 1 of The Rising of the Shield Hero, \"A New Roar,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season returns to continue the isekai adventure of The Rising of the Shield Hero's unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi. By the end of Season 1, however, Naofumi's fortunes had reversed. Now as Season 2 begins, he takes another important step forward by adding a new member to his adventurer party, Rishia, who already has much-needed experience battling the deadly Waves.  However, Rishia comes with her own baggage. Her original party leader, the Bow Hero Itsuki, rejects her as a foolish weakling, so now she clings to Naofumi as her new leader and is desperate to prove herself. Naofumi welcomes Rishia to his party but it won't be easy, and she makes a difficult choice in order to attain more power. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters                Season 2, Episode 1 of Shield Hero finds Naofumi's party working hard to help prepare Lurolona village's defenses for the inevitable next Wave. The tanuki girl Raphtalia feels more prepared for action than ever, and the same is true for Filo. By contrast, the green-haired Rishia struggles to prove her worth, though she does have some talent with controlling her qi energy during a practice session. Suddenly a swarm of oversized bats attacks, and it's up to everyone except Rishia to fight them off.  Rishia feels inadequate compared to everyone around her, and her insecurities mount as she repeatedly fails to fight for Naofumi or impress any of the Cardinal Heroes. She is practically trapped in a vicious cycle of her weak performance undermining her confidence, which in turn destabilizes her performance as an adventurer. This might only get worse as Naofumi's adventure continues, but fortunately for Rishia, her new leader actually looks out for his companions. Raphtalia shares Naofumi's generous spirit and offers to help Rishia power up in time for the next Wave -- but her chosen method may leave a bad taste in some people's mouths, including Naofumi. The party heads to the same well-dressed slave trader in the capital city who had sold Raphtalia to Naofumi months ago, and Raphtalia recommends that Rishia get a slave crest to become a formal -- and stronger -- member of the party. Naofumi objects at first but Rishia insists, so he and the slave trader follow through and add the crest. As hoped, Rishia's stats receive an immediate boost, and Naofumi's RPG-style HUD gets updates on her status. There's no going back now.  RELATED: How Shield Hero Reinvents the Beach Episode Concept, Isekai Style                Rishia's decision to willingly get a slave crest placed on her says a few things about her and Naofumi alike. Her willingness to get this type of power-boost -- and Naofumi's hesitation to give her one -- shows that he has lost his taste for slave crests and slavery as a whole since Shield Hero started, which is a change for the better. Earlier on he was desperate for allies and resources, and at the time he had no qualms about buying Raphtalia and using her crest to discipline her. Now Naofumi has more assets and allies than ever. That, combined with his better attitude after getting his name cleared of that false crime, means he has a new mindset. He is no longer a bitter pragmatist but a proper role model and father figure to his party, and he won't use slave crests unless the other person demands it.  In addition, Rishia's actions suggest she is the new Naofumi: an unfortunate and desperate adventurer who will pay any price to get what she needs to survive, even resorting to slavery and cruel magic. The main difference is that Rishia wanted the slave crest for herself instead of putting it on someone else. It shows remarkable resolve and commitment, but also a low sense of self-worth. For now, her desperation and low self-esteem define her character arc in Shield Hero, but if she can score some victories in upcoming Waves, that may soon change -- and she might even rethink her slave crest.

This is the first time Terry will have to go solo without the voice of his mentor and friend guiding him. During the events of Batman: Urban Legends #7, published by DC Comics last year, Bruce's pacemaker overloads and kills him, but not before he gives Terry his blessings. An enraged Terry tears the city apart in search of the culprit, only to come back home to the Batcave and realize it was Gotham itself that killed Bruce. A super-intelligence, dubbed the Neo-Gotham, now runs through the city's veins and has identified Batman as the virus. Written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing with artwork from Max Dunbar and Sebastian Cheng and lettering by Aditya Bidikar, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 starts a new chapter for Batman.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 pits Terry McGinnis against the sentinel AI avatar of Gotham City. It has been two months since Neo-Gotham woke up and killed Bruce Wayne and two months since Terry started his solitary crusade against the criminal element. However, he is nowhere near cleansing the streets of crime or turning Gotham on his side. To add to the predicament, Bruce's other legacy, the Wayne-Powers corporation, is now run by a former crook, the Holographic Man. Batman investigates the new CEO when he comes across a cargo ship carrying drug supplies. As he is about to jump into action, an agent of Neo-Gotham stops him in his tracks. Now he has two choices: stand down or join Gotham in her upcoming genocide.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Beyond the White Knight #1 Comic Review                 Terry McGinnis is at a crossroads in his life. With his mentor gone and the number of allies dwindling, Terry is trying hard to keep the peace in his city while desperately clamoring to keep Bruce's legacy intact. Loneliness has gripped him as Batman is spread thin over Gotham putting out fires. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 envisions a different kind of Gotham, one that is aesthetically techno-modern but has transcended the barriers of technology and is now turning on its own citizens. The only person in its way is its sworn protector. A linear narrative with a heavy emphasis on its protagonist, the story progresses through Terry's point of view, using first-person narrative boxes to explore his inner feelings and resolve. The debut issue of this Batman Beyond reboot does well to provide exposition through character interactions. The action kicks up a notch in the latter half, with new adversaries rearing their heads.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 showcases a neon-lit, futuristic Gotham City filled with high-tech machinery and ultramodern urban architecture. Artist Max Dunbar uses crisp lines and elaborately detailed backgrounds to infuse the pages with animated energy that gives off a cartoonish vibe. To not take away from the seriousness of the plot, Dunbar employs a variety of techniques, from glaring close-ups to brooding panels. However, what catches the eye are the full-length splash pages that frame the characters, new and old, in their natural element. Meanwhile, the coloring best brings out the neo-futuristic aesthetic of the book. Colorist Sebastian Cheng's use of alternate tones of colors to create light and shadow gives depth to the artwork. Cheng douses the Gotham sky in an eternal shade of soothing purple, creating a great contrast with Batman's black and red.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Killing Time #2 Comic Review                 From the get-go, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 never seems to let its foot off the gas, continuing the momentum and suspense that started in the pages of Batman: Urban Legends #7 all the while adding new flavors into the mix as the story progresses. A fan-favorite character, Terry McGinnis is at a rough spot in his life, and it is only going to get tougher. After years of listening to an old grumpy man's voice in his head, Terry has developed an unhealthy habit of speaking to an absent father figure. His grief gives the overlaying narration a melancholic tune. As times get tough, Terry must brace himself as Gotham comes for all that stand against it.

By Sam Stone Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Superman & Lois is poised for a deep dive into the morally inverted Bizarro world, and here's how the twisted Smallville takes its cues from Riverdale                 WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Superman & Lois Season 2, Episode 9, \"30 Days and 30 Nights,\" which aired Tuesday, March 29, on The CW.  Superman & Lois Season 2 has introduced into the Inverse World, a strange reversed version of the Arrowverse's reality, complete with its own familiar faces mirroring the main cast, including the brutal Bizarro. Glimpsed briefly as Bizarro recounted how he arrived in the Arrowverse, the Inverse World appears to be ruled by this reality's version of cult leader Ally Allston, with this world's super-powered iteration of Lana Lang as her enforcer. With the series poised for a deeper exploration of this shadowy, twisted reality, the promo from the season's tenth episode suggests the Inverse World will take stylistic cues from Riverdale.  The promo for the episode \"Bizarros in a Bizarro World\" appears to expand on Bizarro's origin story, with the Inverse World's Superman and Lois seen embracing the fame and glamor that comes with Clark Kent being the most celebrated superhero in this universe. In this morally inverted reality, decadence and debauchery appears to be the de facto law of the land, with the citizens of Smallville indulging in their baser impulses while Ally is seen discovering the means to access the Arrowverse. In this glimpse, the fashion, cinematography and lighting is all visually reminiscent of Riverdale.  RELATED: Iconic Fan Art Unites Robert Pattinson's Batman and Tyler Hoechlin's Superman Among the more noticeable similarities between the two CW series is the difference in outfits worn by the Inverse World characters in comparison to their Arrowverse counterparts. There's a lot of leather and black in the Inverse World wardrobe, with the Jonathan of this world practically looking like one of Riverdale's Southside Vipers while providing a nod to Conner Kent's original Superboy costume. Lois and Lana dressed more suggestively than their Arrowverse doppelg\u00e4ngers, while many people around Smallville are seen in similar brusquer attire.                  There are tonal similarities as well, with the affluence and adoration that Superman and his family enjoy evoking the wealth and social status that the Lodges and Blossoms have lorded over their Riverdale neighbors for years.

RELATED: Superman & Lois: Lana's Political Career Got Saved By the Unlikeliest Person  Riverdale was always a show that took the poster boy for wholesome, family friendly comic book fun and subverted it into a bloody crime story, complete with next-door serial killers and rival gangs. Recognizable elements from Archie Comics were still there but repurposed to be given an unsettling edge as Archie Andrews found themselves literally struggling to survive against the hidden evils of their hometown.

It will be interesting to see how much of this more debauched Smallville is intact without its greatest hero and how the Arrowverse Superman will react to it. But judging by the promos, the Man of Tomorrow is sure to find the Inverse World to be a thoroughly unpleasant place and a nightmarish twist on the home he left behind.

Superman & Lois' Bizarro World Looks a Lot Like... Riverdale?  By Sam Stone Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Superman & Lois is poised for a deep dive into the morally inverted Bizarro world, and here's how the twisted Smallville takes its cues from Riverdale                 WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Superman & Lois Season 2, Episode 9, \"30 Days and 30 Nights,\" which aired Tuesday, March 29, on The CW.  Superman & Lois Season 2 has introduced into the Inverse World, a strange reversed version of the Arrowverse's reality, complete with its own familiar faces mirroring the main cast, including the brutal Bizarro. Glimpsed briefly as Bizarro recounted how he arrived in the Arrowverse, the Inverse World appears to be ruled by this reality's version of cult leader Ally Allston, with this world's super-powered iteration of Lana Lang as her enforcer. With the series poised for a deeper exploration of this shadowy, twisted reality, the promo from the season's tenth episode suggests the Inverse World will take stylistic cues from Riverdale.  The promo for the episode \"Bizarros in a Bizarro World\" appears to expand on Bizarro's origin story, with the Inverse World's Superman and Lois seen embracing the fame and glamor that comes with Clark Kent being the most celebrated superhero in this universe. In this morally inverted reality, decadence and debauchery appears to be the de facto law of the land, with the citizens of Smallville indulging in their baser impulses while Ally is seen discovering the means to access the Arrowverse. In this glimpse, the fashion, cinematography and lighting is all visually reminiscent of Riverdale.  RELATED: Iconic Fan Art Unites Robert Pattinson's Batman and Tyler Hoechlin's Superman Among the more noticeable similarities between the two CW series is the difference in outfits worn by the Inverse World characters in comparison to their Arrowverse counterparts. There's a lot of leather and black in the Inverse World wardrobe, with the Jonathan of this world practically looking like one of Riverdale's Southside Vipers while providing a nod to Conner Kent's original Superboy costume. Lois and Lana dressed more suggestively than their Arrowverse doppelg\u00e4ngers, while many people around Smallville are seen in similar brusquer attire.                  There are tonal similarities as well, with the affluence and adoration that Superman and his family enjoy evoking the wealth and social status that the Lodges and Blossoms have lorded over their Riverdale neighbors for years. Lois and Lana are shown hinting at having their own sinister edge, with a quiet menace to their appearances in the promos. Smallville is no longer the wholesome picture of small town Americana but a place where everyone has a deadly secret and can indulge in their worst impulses.

Home Anime Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army    Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army  By Kelvin Kwao Published 1 hour ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   My Hero Academia's Twice is the series' most hilarious villain -- however, his mysterious past is anything but.                 The villains of My Hero Academia are no strangers to conflict, but Bubaigawara Jin, aka Twice, literally couldn't imagine his life without it. Following a tragic accident involving the use of his Double Quirk, Twice had to live with an alter ego in his head, constantly second-guessing his decisions and, at times, even blurting out the opposite of what the villain intended to say. It was a condition that severely hampered his ability to relate to others. However, Twice's troubles began long before.  My Hero Academia goes to great lengths to drive home the point that most of its villains are victims, in some way, of the Quirk-based society: Himiko Toga's Transform Quirk gives her an insatiable thirst for blood; Dabi's vendetta against Endeavor stemmed from the abuse he'd endured as a child. However, among them, there was no greater victim of circumstance than Twice. His foray into villainy wasn't a path he chose, nor was it one he seemed to particularly enjoy, but that was the only path left available to him. RELATED: Near-Forgotten MHA Theory Rises From the Ashes - and Dabi May Do the Same                  Twice had been alone from the beginning. He had no family or friends to rely on for support, and he was destitute once a car accident left him with a criminal record. With no one willing to hire a registered felon, Twice took to petty villainy for survival, and used his Double Quirk to create the community he'd lacked, as well as an infinite number of henchmen. All was well until his clones turned on each other, asserting that each was the original Twice. The sight of many iterations of himself physically harming each other broke something within Twice, and ever since, his strange condition manifested, and he vowed not to use his Quirk in himself ever again.  Despite the terrible cards that life had dealt him, Twice maintained his upbeat view on life, and once he joined the League of Villains, he was ecstatic that he'd made new friends. Being a mentally unstable villain left him with few avenues where he was accepted as he was, so he treasured the League for granting him this new community. He was quite devoted to his friends, and was always eager to prove his usefulness to the team. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 Twice proved his devotion to the League several times over. He never used his Quirk for personal gain, although he was arguably the most powerful member of the team; it formed a valuable tool the League could exploit during its guerrilla raids. When the League was in the greatest danger, during the fight against the Meta-Liberation Army, Twice overcame his fear of doubling himself. In an instant,he created an army to rescue his friends, and in a matter of moments had completely turned the tide against the thousands of Liberation soldiers.  Twice's death occurred in the pursuit of his goal to protect the League. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Hawks cornered him and warned that he'd be forced to take Twice down if he didn't surrender. Undeterred by the threat, Twice continued fighting to protect the League, forcing Hawks to end his life lest Twice trigger another unstoppable Sad Man's Parade. Twice's death, apart from being one of the series most emotional moments, was the first instance a Pro-Hero had been shown using fatal force against a villain. At that moment, the line between hero and villain was blurred, especially since the victim was in the pursuit of a goal that would be described as heroic if he was any of the series' main cast. At his core, Twice was just a man who loved and wished to protect his friends burdened with the mistakes of his past. He was the furthest thing from evil and that made him one of My Hero Academia's most interesting villains.

RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 Twice proved his devotion to the League several times over. He never used his Quirk for personal gain, although he was arguably the most powerful member of the team; it formed a valuable tool the League could exploit during its guerrilla raids. When the League was in the greatest danger, during the fight against the Meta-Liberation Army, Twice overcame his fear of doubling himself. In an instant,he created an army to rescue his friends, and in a matter of moments had completely turned the tide against the thousands of Liberation soldiers.  Twice's death occurred in the pursuit of his goal to protect the League. During the Paranormal Liberation War, Hawks cornered him and warned that he'd be forced to take Twice down if he didn't surrender. Undeterred by the threat, Twice continued fighting to protect the League, forcing Hawks to end his life lest Twice trigger another unstoppable Sad Man's Parade. Twice's death, apart from being one of the series most emotional moments, was the first instance a Pro-Hero had been shown using fatal force against a villain. At that moment, the line between hero and villain was blurred, especially since the victim was in the pursuit of a goal that would be described as heroic if he was any of the series' main cast. At his core, Twice was just a man who loved and wished to protect his friends burdened with the mistakes of his past. He was the furthest thing from evil and that made him one of My Hero Academia's most interesting villains.

Here are some of the best slice of life titles with darker themes.                  The following article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm.   Slice of life as a genre is generally accepted as a pretty lighthearted display of everyday life with no major conflicts. It\u2019s often grounded within a strong comedic premise, characterized by bright colors and cheerful characters. Series like Nichijou and Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku are great examples of a traditional take on this genre.  In recent years, anime studios have begun experimenting with incorporating darker themes into what had previously been established as a bright genre. This is in line with the growing maturity of audiences as well as the growing diversity of anime. Combining slice of life with dark themes adds extra depth to a series, without making it so heavy that it could be hard to watch. Here are some of the best examples of slice of life anime that have dark undertones. RELATED: Flying Witch Shares a Fascinating Concept With Harry Potter - and It's Not Magic          Wonder Egg Priority Looks Into the Inner Demons of Humanity                 As one of the most recent adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority follows the story of Ai Ooto after the suicide of her best friend, Koito Nagase. Following the instructions of a mysterious entity, Ai purchases a Wonder Egg, which enables her to fight off people\u2019s trauma, regrets and fears as fantasized enemies in a dream realm. With each person she successfully saves from their demons, she grows one step closer to saving her best friend. Despite the deceptively bright colors and youthful protagonists, Wonder Egg Priority explores the depths of humanity\u2019s inner demons through their dream realms. A sexually abused girl facing off against the monsterized teacher that abused her. A school gymnast standing up against a gym teacher that pressurised her. It\u2019s made even more poignant and bittersweet when it\u2019s revealed that all the victims are already dead.  RELATED: The Most Overlooked Iyashikei Anime Series - and Where to Watch Them          Girls\u2019 Last Tour Explores a Post-Apocalyptic World                 Girls\u2019 Last Tour is set amid the rubble of a once-thriving city torn apart by war. In this post-apocalyptic setting, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the only survivors as they ride through the desolation on their motorbike, scavenging for food and contemplating life before the war. This entire anime is lighthearted and cutesy, detailing their everyday adventures and discoveries. However, by framing their story from a third-person perspective, it offers a unique insight into the reality of the situation beyond what the girls themselves might perceive.  RELATED: Aharen-san Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters          Your Lie in April Treasures the Fragility of Life                 Initially presented as a typical slice of life school anime, Your Lie in April quickly takes a dive into the deep end. It is revealed that prodigious pianist Kousei Arima can no longer hear the sound of the piano after his mother\u2019s death. Amid themes of childhood trauma, Kousei finally regains color in his life when he meets the upbeat violinist Kaori Miyazono, who hides a secret of her own beneath her cheerful facade. Interspersed between peaceful scenes of everyday school life are flashbacks to childhood trauma and the realities of dealing with a terminal illness. This duality in dynamics is executed beautifully. Despite the undercurrent of darker themes, the overall tone of this series remains hopeful, playing to the strengths of the slice of life genre.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Orange Tackles Heavy Themes of Mental Health                 At its core, Orange tells a story of regret. One day, 16-year-old Naho Takamiya receives a strange letter from herself 10 years in the future, detailing the regrets her future self wished to fix. Among those is one related to the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, who is no longer alive in the future. Given the opportunity to fix past mistakes, Naho strives to save Kakeru before history repeats itself. The themes of Orange are made a lot more significant because its setting is grounded in reality. Mental health leading to suicide is often very subtle and hard to notice, and this story accurately portrays that. It doesn\u2019t overdramatize the issue but invites the audience to look out for signs and clues along with the protagonists.  RELATED: 2022 Is Proving Anime Fans Can Always Hope for Their Favorite Series' Return          Usagi Drop Breaks the Stigma of Being a Single Parent                 Anime can explore a lot of dark themes, but the topic of being a single parent is rarely touched upon. Usagi Drop follows 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi Kawachi as he tries to raise Rin, his grandfather\u2019s illegitimate daughter with no child-rearing experience whatsoever. Daikichi and Rin have a very unique father-daughter relationship. Forced together by circumstance, both are trying to adjust to this new life and relationship dynamic. It\u2019s endearing to see how they learn and grow together through everyday annoyances and troubles.  Slice of life anime doesn\u2019t just have to be simple stories of everyday fun. When used in conjunction with darker themes, they offer a much more complex process of storytelling which sets these series apart from others.

Here are some of the best slice of life titles with darker themes.                  The following article contains discussion of suicide and self-harm.   Slice of life as a genre is generally accepted as a pretty lighthearted display of everyday life with no major conflicts. It\u2019s often grounded within a strong comedic premise, characterized by bright colors and cheerful characters. Series like Nichijou and Wotakoi: Love Is Hard for Otaku are great examples of a traditional take on this genre.  In recent years, anime studios have begun experimenting with incorporating darker themes into what had previously been established as a bright genre. This is in line with the growing maturity of audiences as well as the growing diversity of anime. Combining slice of life with dark themes adds extra depth to a series, without making it so heavy that it could be hard to watch. Here are some of the best examples of slice of life anime that have dark undertones. RELATED: Flying Witch Shares a Fascinating Concept With Harry Potter - and It's Not Magic          Wonder Egg Priority Looks Into the Inner Demons of Humanity                 As one of the most recent adaptations, Wonder Egg Priority follows the story of Ai Ooto after the suicide of her best friend, Koito Nagase. Following the instructions of a mysterious entity, Ai purchases a Wonder Egg, which enables her to fight off people\u2019s trauma, regrets and fears as fantasized enemies in a dream realm. With each person she successfully saves from their demons, she grows one step closer to saving her best friend. Despite the deceptively bright colors and youthful protagonists, Wonder Egg Priority explores the depths of humanity\u2019s inner demons through their dream realms. A sexually abused girl facing off against the monsterized teacher that abused her. A school gymnast standing up against a gym teacher that pressurised her. It\u2019s made even more poignant and bittersweet when it\u2019s revealed that all the victims are already dead.  RELATED: The Most Overlooked Iyashikei Anime Series - and Where to Watch Them          Girls\u2019 Last Tour Explores a Post-Apocalyptic World                 Girls\u2019 Last Tour is set amid the rubble of a once-thriving city torn apart by war. In this post-apocalyptic setting, Chito and Yuuri seem to be the only survivors as they ride through the desolation on their motorbike, scavenging for food and contemplating life before the war. This entire anime is lighthearted and cutesy, detailing their everyday adventures and discoveries. However, by framing their story from a third-person perspective, it offers a unique insight into the reality of the situation beyond what the girls themselves might perceive.  RELATED: Aharen-san Redefines the Possibilities of Kuudere Anime Characters          Your Lie in April Treasures the Fragility of Life                 Initially presented as a typical slice of life school anime, Your Lie in April quickly takes a dive into the deep end. It is revealed that prodigious pianist Kousei Arima can no longer hear the sound of the piano after his mother\u2019s death. Amid themes of childhood trauma, Kousei finally regains color in his life when he meets the upbeat violinist Kaori Miyazono, who hides a secret of her own beneath her cheerful facade. Interspersed between peaceful scenes of everyday school life are flashbacks to childhood trauma and the realities of dealing with a terminal illness. This duality in dynamics is executed beautifully. Despite the undercurrent of darker themes, the overall tone of this series remains hopeful, playing to the strengths of the slice of life genre.  RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          Orange Tackles Heavy Themes of Mental Health                 At its core, Orange tells a story of regret. One day, 16-year-old Naho Takamiya receives a strange letter from herself 10 years in the future, detailing the regrets her future self wished to fix. Among those is one related to the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, who is no longer alive in the future. Given the opportunity to fix past mistakes, Naho strives to save Kakeru before history repeats itself. The themes of Orange are made a lot more significant because its setting is grounded in reality. Mental health leading to suicide is often very subtle and hard to notice, and this story accurately portrays that. It doesn\u2019t overdramatize the issue but invites the audience to look out for signs and clues along with the protagonists.  RELATED: 2022 Is Proving Anime Fans Can Always Hope for Their Favorite Series' Return          Usagi Drop Breaks the Stigma of Being a Single Parent                 Anime can explore a lot of dark themes, but the topic of being a single parent is rarely touched upon. Usagi Drop follows 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi Kawachi as he tries to raise Rin, his grandfather\u2019s illegitimate daughter with no child-rearing experience whatsoever. Daikichi and Rin have a very unique father-daughter relationship. Forced together by circumstance, both are trying to adjust to this new life and relationship dynamic. It\u2019s endearing to see how they learn and grow together through everyday annoyances and troubles.  Slice of life anime doesn\u2019t just have to be simple stories of everyday fun. When used in conjunction with darker themes, they offer a much more complex process of storytelling which sets these series apart from others.

They're adding some essential classics as well.                 HBO Max has quickly made a name for itself as a major player in the streaming game. Thanks in part to the controversial partnership with Warner Bros., the service saw several exclusive 30-day release windows for some of 2021's biggest films. Additionally, HBO has a massive rotating library of classic films due to a partnership with Turner Classic Movies.  RELATED: https://www.cbr.com/great-hbo-original-movies-to-hbo-max/ No other streaming service offers quite an array of highbrow to lowbrow entertainment, television, and films to suit any taste. April sees HBO adding a bunch of original content to their site/app, bringing back a load of critically acclaimed series, and some classics for good measure.  8          Tokyo Vice - Series (Available Now)                Based on Jake Adelstein's non-fiction novel of the same name, HBO Max's Tokyo Vice is a tale about an American's descent into the world of Japanese Yakuza. Ansel Elgort plays Adelstein, a young reporter who joins the staff of a Japanese newspaper. As their first foreign staffer, he is shown the ropes by a veteran vice squad detective, played by the always-good Ken Watanabe.  Adelstein faces scrutiny and prejudice everywhere he goes, and the further he gets into the underworld, the more dangerous things become for him. The show is executive produced by Michael Mann, who also directed the Tokyo Vice's first episode. The Flight Attendant - Season 2 Premiere (April 21)                The Flight Attendant is an oddity that defies easy categorization. On its surface, it's a story about a hard-partying flight attendant named Cassie (played by Kaley Cuoco) who wakes up in Bangkok to discover a dead body next to her. Unsure of how events transpired to lead to this, she sets about covering up the crime.  RELATED: 10 Crime Dramas That Are Actually Worth Watching All the while she suffers from hallucinations and the viewers are treated to flashbacks piecing together the events. Season 2 picks up after Cassie has put the first season's events behind her, taking a vow of sobriety, and possibly becoming an \"asset\" for the CIA. Barry - Season 3 Premiere (April 24)                HBO's Barry is one of those shows that is so meticulously plotted and well thought out that no stone feels left unturned. Season 1 depicted Barry (Bill Hader, who also created the series) as a jaded hitman who found solace in a small theater troupe. Barry meets a young woman who's having troubles of her own, and a charismatic acting coach. While Barry juggles his two vastly different interests, he ends up starting a gang war.  In season 2, Barry narrowly avoided capture and set in motion a chain of events that all but confirmed that there's no way for a hitman to try and attempt a normal life. With Barry's full embrace of darkness, it's going to be surprising to see where the series can go.  7          We Own This City - Miniseries Premiere (April 25)                It's always great news when David Simon returns to Baltimore. co-producing and co-writing Simon brings We Own This City, a six-episode limited series based on the book by Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton, to HBO Max. The show is about the intricacies of Baltimore's Gun Trace Task Force, a failed endeavor that led to countless arrests and very little in the way of actual change.  As usual, Simon looks at the web of corruption and various moral quandaries that befall those who are in the heart of law enforcement. Along for the ride is crime novelist George Pelecanos, who's doubling on producer and writing duties as well.  6          The Survivor - Film (April 27)                Barry Levinson directs The Survivor, a Holocaust drama that looks to be an astonishing, transformative turn for the usually great Ben Foster. Foster stars as Harry Haft, an Auschwitz survivor, who, beyond the horrific hardships of internment, was also forced to compete in death-match brawls at the behest of Nazi officers.  Later, after the War, Taft is looking to make a name for himself as an up-and-coming boxer, by challenging Rocky Marciano to a fight. Vicky Krieps co-stars as the woman from Taft's past with whom he will stop at nothing to be reunited with. Peter Sarsgaard, Danny DeVito, and John Leguizamo round out the superb cast.  5          Made For Love - Season 2 Premiere (April 28)                Made for Love is an extremely dark, extremely funny little gem from HBO that deserves to be seen. Based on the novel of the same name by Alissa Nutting, the series retains the author\u2019s twisted sense of humor and social acuity. In short, a woman is fitted with a tracking device that allows her tech billionaire ex to know her whereabouts.  The series charts Cristin Milioti\u2019s Hazel as she navigates the bizarre not entirely unfamiliar world in search of herself, and possibly love. The series' sharp satiric lens is well complemented by genuine pathos. Who would've imagined that a father's relationship with a sex doll could be mined for genuine pathos?  4          The Baby - Miniseries Premiere (April 24)                Not everyone is a baby person. Not everyone is cut out for parenting, and not everyone even wants or imagines that sort of life for themselves. Such is the central conceit of HBO Max's new horror-comedy, The Baby. When a baby literally falls into her arms, 38-year-old Natasha ends up being stuck with the child.  The premise sounds simple enough, with all that it entails: trying to regain one's independence, learning how to care for something. But something is amiss, and the baby brings with it plenty of trouble beyond the normal parenting woes. It's almost as if the baby has chosen Natasha.  3          The Invisible Pilot - Docu-Series (Available Now)                In 1977, Gary Betzner jumped from a bridge to his death. No body was ever found. Of course, the truth is stranger than fiction, and there's much more to Gary's tale than meets the eye. So begins the true story behind HBO's new 3-part documentary, The Invisible Pilot. It's a spoiler to give away too much about Gary Betzner's actions, and what he was involved in, but suffice to say, there is an intriguing story behind the man.  The Invisible Pilot asks: What could drive a crop-duster in Arkansas to commit such a shocking act? And the truth behind the legend is much more bizarre and shocking than anyone can imagine.  2          The Raid: Redemption - Film (Available Now) The Raid: Redemption should be higher on the list rankings of the all-time greatest action films. The 2011 kinetic actioner follows a team of police who are sent into the heart of a project tower to arrest an incredibly powerful drug/slumlord. Little do they know that they're being set up, and when the crime boss announces free drugs for anyone who can bring him the heads of the invading officers, all hell breaks loose.  RELATED: 10 Action Movies That Aren't Afraid To Get Emotional Fortunately, the police have Rama and Jaka on their side, playing by Iko Uwais and Joe Taslim, respectively. Few films have action as well-choreographed as The Raid, and it's baffling that the film didn't kill any stuntmen in during its production.  1          Tootsie - Film (Available Now)                Tootsie is one of the great films, full stop. It tells the story of a down-and-out actor, Michael (played by Dustin Hoffman), who undergoes a crisis of faith \u2013 not even considered for bit parts \u2013 and subsequently decides to re-brand himself as a woman. As Dorothy, Michael can glide into rooms with an unassuming quality that disarms most people around him. Miraculously, nobody can see through the ruse, and he ends up landing a role in a soap opera.  The film isn't interested in saying much more complicated things about gender identity, and some of its core conceit is undoubtedly dated, but Tootsie is a well-written, thoughtfully considered examination of relationships, and the pursuit of success.                  5 Things We Want From HBO's Watchmen (& 5 Things We Don't Want)  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Lists movies television TV HBO Max     About The Author      Howard Waldstein                                     (8 Articles Published)     Howard is a writer and editor living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

They're adding some essential classics as well.                 HBO Max has quickly made a name for itself as a major player in the streaming game. Thanks in part to the controversial partnership with Warner Bros., the service saw several exclusive 30-day release windows for some of 2021's biggest films. Additionally, HBO has a massive rotating library of classic films due to a partnership with Turner Classic Movies.  RELATED: https://www.cbr.com/great-hbo-original-movies-to-hbo-max/ No other streaming service offers quite an array of highbrow to lowbrow entertainment, television, and films to suit any taste. April sees HBO adding a bunch of original content to their site/app, bringing back a load of critically acclaimed series, and some classics for good measure.  8          Tokyo Vice - Series (Available Now)                Based on Jake Adelstein's non-fiction novel of the same name, HBO Max's Tokyo Vice is a tale about an American's descent into the world of Japanese Yakuza. Ansel Elgort plays Adelstein, a young reporter who joins the staff of a Japanese newspaper. As their first foreign staffer, he is shown the ropes by a veteran vice squad detective, played by the always-good Ken Watanabe.  Adelstein faces scrutiny and prejudice everywhere he goes, and the further he gets into the underworld, the more dangerous things become for him. The show is executive produced by Michael Mann, who also directed the Tokyo Vice's first episode. The Flight Attendant - Season 2 Premiere (April 21)                The Flight Attendant is an oddity that defies easy categorization. On its surface, it's a story about a hard-partying flight attendant named Cassie (played by Kaley Cuoco) who wakes up in Bangkok to discover a dead body next to her. Unsure of how events transpired to lead to this, she sets about covering up the crime.  RELATED: 10 Crime Dramas That Are Actually Worth Watching All the while she suffers from hallucinations and the viewers are treated to flashbacks piecing together the events. Season 2 picks up after Cassie has put the first season's events behind her, taking a vow of sobriety, and possibly becoming an \"asset\" for the CIA. Barry - Season 3 Premiere (April 24)                HBO's Barry is one of those shows that is so meticulously plotted and well thought out that no stone feels left unturned. Season 1 depicted Barry (Bill Hader, who also created the series) as a jaded hitman who found solace in a small theater troupe. Barry meets a young woman who's having troubles of her own, and a charismatic acting coach. While Barry juggles his two vastly different interests, he ends up starting a gang war.  In season 2, Barry narrowly avoided capture and set in motion a chain of events that all but confirmed that there's no way for a hitman to try and attempt a normal life. With Barry's full embrace of darkness, it's going to be surprising to see where the series can go.  7          We Own This City - Miniseries Premiere (April 25)                It's always great news when David Simon returns to Baltimore. co-producing and co-writing Simon brings We Own This City, a six-episode limited series based on the book by Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton, to HBO Max. The show is about the intricacies of Baltimore's Gun Trace Task Force, a failed endeavor that led to countless arrests and very little in the way of actual change.  As usual, Simon looks at the web of corruption and various moral quandaries that befall those who are in the heart of law enforcement. Along for the ride is crime novelist George Pelecanos, who's doubling on producer and writing duties as well.  6          The Survivor - Film (April 27)                Barry Levinson directs The Survivor, a Holocaust drama that looks to be an astonishing, transformative turn for the usually great Ben Foster. Foster stars as Harry Haft, an Auschwitz survivor, who, beyond the horrific hardships of internment, was also forced to compete in death-match brawls at the behest of Nazi officers.  Later, after the War, Taft is looking to make a name for himself as an up-and-coming boxer, by challenging Rocky Marciano to a fight. Vicky Krieps co-stars as the woman from Taft's past with whom he will stop at nothing to be reunited with. Peter Sarsgaard, Danny DeVito, and John Leguizamo round out the superb cast.  5          Made For Love - Season 2 Premiere (April 28)                Made for Love is an extremely dark, extremely funny little gem from HBO that deserves to be seen. Based on the novel of the same name by Alissa Nutting, the series retains the author\u2019s twisted sense of humor and social acuity. In short, a woman is fitted with a tracking device that allows her tech billionaire ex to know her whereabouts.  The series charts Cristin Milioti\u2019s Hazel as she navigates the bizarre not entirely unfamiliar world in search of herself, and possibly love. The series' sharp satiric lens is well complemented by genuine pathos. Who would've imagined that a father's relationship with a sex doll could be mined for genuine pathos?  4          The Baby - Miniseries Premiere (April 24)                Not everyone is a baby person. Not everyone is cut out for parenting, and not everyone even wants or imagines that sort of life for themselves. Such is the central conceit of HBO Max's new horror-comedy, The Baby. When a baby literally falls into her arms, 38-year-old Natasha ends up being stuck with the child.  The premise sounds simple enough, with all that it entails: trying to regain one's independence, learning how to care for something. But something is amiss, and the baby brings with it plenty of trouble beyond the normal parenting woes. It's almost as if the baby has chosen Natasha.  3          The Invisible Pilot - Docu-Series (Available Now)                In 1977, Gary Betzner jumped from a bridge to his death. No body was ever found. Of course, the truth is stranger than fiction, and there's much more to Gary's tale than meets the eye. So begins the true story behind HBO's new 3-part documentary, The Invisible Pilot. It's a spoiler to give away too much about Gary Betzner's actions, and what he was involved in, but suffice to say, there is an intriguing story behind the man.  The Invisible Pilot asks: What could drive a crop-duster in Arkansas to commit such a shocking act? And the truth behind the legend is much more bizarre and shocking than anyone can imagine.  2          The Raid: Redemption - Film (Available Now) The Raid: Redemption should be higher on the list rankings of the all-time greatest action films. The 2011 kinetic actioner follows a team of police who are sent into the heart of a project tower to arrest an incredibly powerful drug/slumlord. Little do they know that they're being set up, and when the crime boss announces free drugs for anyone who can bring him the heads of the invading officers, all hell breaks loose.  RELATED: 10 Action Movies That Aren't Afraid To Get Emotional Fortunately, the police have Rama and Jaka on their side, playing by Iko Uwais and Joe Taslim, respectively. Few films have action as well-choreographed as The Raid, and it's baffling that the film didn't kill any stuntmen in during its production.  1          Tootsie - Film (Available Now)                Tootsie is one of the great films, full stop. It tells the story of a down-and-out actor, Michael (played by Dustin Hoffman), who undergoes a crisis of faith \u2013 not even considered for bit parts \u2013 and subsequently decides to re-brand himself as a woman. As Dorothy, Michael can glide into rooms with an unassuming quality that disarms most people around him. Miraculously, nobody can see through the ruse, and he ends up landing a role in a soap opera.  The film isn't interested in saying much more complicated things about gender identity, and some of its core conceit is undoubtedly dated, but Tootsie is a well-written, thoughtfully considered examination of relationships, and the pursuit of success.                  5 Things We Want From HBO's Watchmen (& 5 Things We Don't Want)  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Lists movies television TV HBO Max     About The Author      Howard Waldstein                                     (8 Articles Published)     Howard is a writer and editor living in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

Here is how to unlock it and its upgrades.                 One of the greatest video games in the original PlayStation library is 1997's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which has since been re-released in a variety of formats for modern consoles. Serving as a sequel to Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, Symphony of the Night revolutionized the entire Castlevania franchise with its nonlinear, exploration-based gameplay. It was also innovative to cast Alucard, Dracula's son, as the main protagonist.  Alucard had many abilities to help him as he ventured through his father's castle. As a dhampir himself, Alucard can unlock supernatural powers to help him confront his enemies, including the ability to transform into a large vampire bat. Here is how to unlock the incredibly useful Bat Form, the unique abilities that come with this magical transformation and how to find several upgrades to make Alucard's transformation even more powerful.

The Bat Form is powered by the Soul of Bat relic. In order to reach this relic, Alucard must have the Leap Stone and Soul of Mist relic equipped. The Soul of Bat is located in the Long Library.

After its defeat, progress beyond his boss chamber to find a grating that Alucard can pass through while transformed into Mist Form.

In Bat Form, Alucard can fly around the castle, now able to access previously unreachable portions of the map. Alucard flies relatively slowly, making him an easy target for enemies, so It's wise to be cautious.  Bat Form isn't entirely defenseless though, equipped with an attack called the Wing Smash. Consuming a small portion of magic points, this attack will send Alucard hurtling forward in his Bat Form, striking anything in his way before transforming back. Bat Form also makes the presence of the Bat Familiar more effective, as it flies closer to Alucard after confusing his transformed state for a potential mate. RELATED: How to Get Castlevania: Symphony of the Night's Strongest Weapon          Bat Form Upgrades In Castlevania: SOTN                 There are three upgrades available for Bat Form in Symphony of the Night, each providing Alucard with a new ability in this form. The only bat upgrade needed to complete the game is Echo of Bat, which allows Alucard to emit a sonar wave and briefly see what's directly ahead of him in darkened areas. This comes in handy when navigating a winding dark room filled with spikes later in the game. Echo of Bat is found in Olrox's Quarters after a boss battle against the vampiric Olrox. As with Wing Crash, emitting the sonar wave consumes magic points.  Echo of Bat can be upgraded further with Force of Echo, which allows the sonar wave to cause damage to any enemies caught in its path. This upgrade is found in the Reverse Caverns after defeating Alucard's doppelg\u00e4nger one last time. Within the Clock Tower of the normal castle, Alucard can fly up to obtain Fire of Bat, an upgrade that allows him to spit fireballs while in Bat Form at the expense of magic points.

Here is how to unlock it and its upgrades.                 One of the greatest video games in the original PlayStation library is 1997's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, which has since been re-released in a variety of formats for modern consoles. Serving as a sequel to Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, Symphony of the Night revolutionized the entire Castlevania franchise with its nonlinear, exploration-based gameplay. It was also innovative to cast Alucard, Dracula's son, as the main protagonist.  Alucard had many abilities to help him as he ventured through his father's castle. As a dhampir himself, Alucard can unlock supernatural powers to help him confront his enemies, including the ability to transform into a large vampire bat.

It seems safe to assume that pop culture will be dominated by reactions to the COVID Pandemic for years to come. Author Michael Moreci has already taken a significant amount of inspiration from the challenges of recent years. He and fellow author Tim Seeley recently worked together to create an apocalyptic horror movie. And now, Moreci has teamed up with artist Alessandro Vitti and AWA Studios to present a new five-part series set in the same universe as J. Michael Straczynski and Michael Deodato's The Resistance. The Joneses #1 is a compelling first issue that introduces readers to a new family of superheroes.  The Joneses #1 follows the Jones family as they struggle to balance their newfound superpowers with their everyday lives in an increasingly divided social climate. Many of their neighbors believe that people with superpowers are responsible for a recent public health crisis, known as \"the Great Death,\" that ravaged the world, so the Joneses are forced to hide who they really are even from their closest friends. As if that wasn't enough stress, the matriarch of the family is having an increasingly difficult time controlling her powers. As tensions rise, dangerous super villains emerge and each member of the family is forced to make difficult decisions.  Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                 Many readers will see shades of the real world in The Joneses #1. Moreci isn't subtle about the parallels between his fiction and reality. \"The Great Death\" feels like a hyperbolic version of the COVID pandemic. Similarly, the divisive nature of public discourse in The Joneses #1 seems to echo the state of the real world. This allegorical approach makes it easy for the reader to acclimate to the world of the comic, giving Moreci the freedom to flesh out his characters. As this first issue unfolds, he reveals more and more about the family's tense, but endearing dynamic. There is something cathartic about watching as a family tackles their personal problems in the wake of a global health crisis.  Vitti's art captures the tone of Moreci's work perfectly. His ability to depict a wide emotional range helps Moreci build tension throughout the numerous difficult conversations that comprise The Joneses #1. He's just as great at capturing the spirit of the landscape. His depictions of suburban Illinois evoke a quiet, almost pastoral feeling until further inspection reveals something sinister lurking behind the cookie-cutter houses. But Vitti's work really comes to life in the action sequences. He draws the daughter's super speed with a frenetic, excitable line that communicates the scope of her power while adding to the overall composition of each page.  Related: IDW's The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 Comic Review                 The Joneses #1 is a well-crafted, thoughtful meditation on life in the aftermath of catastrophe. It functions both as a satirical analysis of the current cultural zeitgeist and a good old-fashioned superhero story. Moreci and Vitti are both firing on all cylinders in this first issue, that has something in it for everyone.

As this first issue unfolds, he reveals more and more about the family's tense, but endearing dynamic. There is something cathartic about watching as a family tackles their personal problems in the wake of a global health crisis.  Vitti's art captures the tone of Moreci's work perfectly. His ability to depict a wide emotional range helps Moreci build tension throughout the numerous difficult conversations that comprise The Joneses #1. He's just as great at capturing the spirit of the landscape. His depictions of suburban Illinois evoke a quiet, almost pastoral feeling until further inspection reveals something sinister lurking behind the cookie-cutter houses. But Vitti's work really comes to life in the action sequences. He draws the daughter's super speed with a frenetic, excitable line that communicates the scope of her power while adding to the overall composition of each page.  Related: IDW's The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 Comic Review                 The Joneses #1 is a well-crafted, thoughtful meditation on life in the aftermath of catastrophe. It functions both as a satirical analysis of the current cultural zeitgeist and a good old-fashioned superhero story. Moreci and Vitti are both firing on all cylinders in this first issue, that has something in it for everyone.

January's Marauders: Annual 2021 #1 by Steve Orlando and Creees Lee followed Captain Kate Pryde and Bishop as they assembled a new team with an altruistic mission to help at-risk mutants around the world. But before they were even finished recruiting, Kate discovered an ancient mysterium puzzle box containing a map and a message with potentially colossal implications about both the past and the future of mutant-kind. Now, Orlando is teaming up with artist Eleonora Carlini, colorist Matt Milla and letterer Ariana Maher to present Marauders #1, an exciting first issue full of surprises.  Marauders #1 begins when Kate Pryde follows the map from the puzzle box to a forgotten corner of Krakoa, where she comes face to face with the infamous Cassandra Nova. Kate still holds Professor Xavier's deranged twin sister responsible for the deaths of countless mutants in the attack on Genosha, but she is a reformist at heart, and Cassandra assures her that she \"couldn't hurt a mutant fly.\" So Nova becomes the final member of the Marauders and points them in the direction of hordes of mutants in need of assistance in outer space. Related: Marvel's X-Men: Red #1 Comic Review                 Orlando does a great job introducing readers to the new team of heroes without getting bogged down in exposition. By introducing the team to Cassandra Nova, Orlando is able to quickly introduce readers to each member of the team to catch readers up naturally. The tension between the Marauders and their powerful new teammate adds to the overall sense of danger and uncertainty that surrounds the team as they embark on a mission to confront the Shi'Ar. By maintaining such a fast pace, Orlando gives the reader a sense of the disorienting flurry of activity that Kate Pryde and her compatriots are struggling to respond to.  Carlini's art complements Orlando's writing perfectly. Her page designs bring the pain and chaos of the action to light in an entertaining, but empathetic way. When Kate and Bishop are trying to help a distraught mutant, Carlini perfectly balances the serious emotional implications of the situation with a thrilling action sequence. The scene that introduces Cassandra Nova is particularly compelling. Carlini reveals the controversial character with a large spread that makes her appear as monstrous as her reputation would suggest. But Carlini's best work in Marauders #1 can be found in her stunning depictions of outer space. She does an excellent job capturing the vast beauty of the landscape to underscore the epic science fiction side of this first issue.  Related: Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review                Marauders #1 ends with the titular heroes in a remarkably precarious position and sets the stage for a fast-paced series. Whether they are exploring the wilds of Krakoa or rocketing into the far reaches of space, the Marauders are intriguing and easy to root for. The entire creative team works together to craft an excellent first issue that is sure to have fans hooked from the very first panel.

January's Marauders: Annual 2021 #1 by Steve Orlando and Creees Lee followed Captain Kate Pryde and Bishop as they assembled a new team with an altruistic mission to help at-risk mutants around the world. But before they were even finished recruiting, Kate discovered an ancient mysterium puzzle box containing a map and a message with potentially colossal implications about both the past and the future of mutant-kind. Now, Orlando is teaming up with artist Eleonora Carlini, colorist Matt Milla and letterer Ariana Maher to present Marauders #1, an exciting first issue full of surprises.  Marauders #1 begins when Kate Pryde follows the map from the puzzle box to a forgotten corner of Krakoa, where she comes face to face with the infamous Cassandra Nova. Kate still holds Professor Xavier's deranged twin sister responsible for the deaths of countless mutants in the attack on Genosha, but she is a reformist at heart, and Cassandra assures her that she \"couldn't hurt a mutant fly.\" So Nova becomes the final member of the Marauders and points them in the direction of hordes of mutants in need of assistance in outer space. Related: Marvel's X-Men: Red #1 Comic Review                 Orlando does a great job introducing readers to the new team of heroes without getting bogged down in exposition. By introducing the team to Cassandra Nova, Orlando is able to quickly introduce readers to each member of the team to catch readers up naturally. The tension between the Marauders and their powerful new teammate adds to the overall sense of danger and uncertainty that surrounds the team as they embark on a mission to confront the Shi'Ar. By maintaining such a fast pace, Orlando gives the reader a sense of the disorienting flurry of activity that Kate Pryde and her compatriots are struggling to respond to.  Carlini's art complements Orlando's writing perfectly. Her page designs bring the pain and chaos of the action to light in an entertaining, but empathetic way. When Kate and Bishop are trying to help a distraught mutant, Carlini perfectly balances the serious emotional implications of the situation with a thrilling action sequence. The scene that introduces Cassandra Nova is particularly compelling. Carlini reveals the controversial character with a large spread that makes her appear as monstrous as her reputation would suggest. But Carlini's best work in Marauders #1 can be found in her stunning depictions of outer space. She does an excellent job capturing the vast beauty of the landscape to underscore the epic science fiction side of this first issue.  Related: Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review                Marauders #1 ends with the titular heroes in a remarkably precarious position and sets the stage for a fast-paced series. Whether they are exploring the wilds of Krakoa or rocketing into the far reaches of space, the Marauders are intriguing and easy to root for. The entire creative team works together to craft an excellent first issue that is sure to have fans hooked from the very first panel.

Marvil's Devil's Reign #6   Artist  Marco Checchetto    Colorist  Marcio Menyz    Cover Artist  Marco Checchetto, Marcio Menyz    Letterer  VC's Clayton Cowles    Price  5.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Chip Zdarsky      The con is up. The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart. Joe, the last remaining purple child, confronts his father in a heated battle, while an angry Daredevil savagely beats up\u00a0the disgraced Mayor. Writer Chip Zdarsky mixes that inner conflict with rage and grief, interlacing Daredevil\u2019s self-questioning narration over the events. Often, when drowning in despair, even the heroes can lose their way, but it is worth remembering that saving one's own soul is saving a life as well.  The artwork of Devil's Reign #6 is an orchestra of swashbuckling action, imposing panels, and pensive closeups. Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Marvil's Devil's Reign #6   Artist  Marco Checchetto    Colorist  Marcio Menyz    Cover Artist  Marco Checchetto, Marcio Menyz    Letterer  VC's Clayton Cowles    Price  5.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Chip Zdarsky      The con is up. The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart. Joe, the last remaining purple child, confronts his father in a heated battle, while an angry Daredevil savagely beats up\u00a0the disgraced Mayor. Writer Chip Zdarsky mixes that inner conflict with rage and grief, interlacing Daredevil\u2019s self-questioning narration over the events. Often, when drowning in despair, even the heroes can lose their way, but it is worth remembering that saving one's own soul is saving a life as well.  The artwork of Devil's Reign #6 is an orchestra of swashbuckling action, imposing panels, and pensive closeups. Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Attack on Titan: The Final Season has brought a number of big surprises to the table, especially as they pertain to the Ackermans.

RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                Historically, the Ackermans were meant to live in service to the Eldian royal family. However, after the fall of Eldia, they rejected King Fritz's idea of peace, so they were persecuted and hunted to near-extinction. It was only after Kenny Ackerman met Uri Reiss, then the reigning king, that the purge stopped.  The Ackerman family was created through experimentation by the old Eldian Empire on the Subjects of Ymir. As a result of this experimentation, the Ackermans were granted the ability to use the Power of the Titans while in human form. This is most observable in their practically-superhuman feats, including Mikasa's strength and Levi's ability to survive a point-blank Thunder Spear. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Historia's Fate Parallels Grisha'sThe Ackermans are also immune to the memory manipulation of the Founding Titan, which is how they retained their memories of life before the Walls. This is also partly the reason they were able to reject King Fritz's ideals; if they could be forced to forget, they wouldn't even know what there was to be against. This inability to be controlled is what led King Fritz to hunt them down to a handful.  Another ability of the Ackermans is to be \"awakened.\" Besides their superhuman abilities, they also gain the battle experience of previous Ackermans through the paths. This is what makes them so proficient in combat, especially Levi \"Humanity's Strongest Soldier\" Ackerman. The only caveat is that the Ackermans need to be awakened by their instinct to survive. Mikasa exemplified this when she was nine and Eren told her to \"fight\" as they were attacked by robbers. By tapping into her hidden potential, she could crush a knife grip, break floorboards, and stab a robber through the heart from behind. If her life wasn't put in danger, she would have remained an ordinary little girl.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Solves the Colossal Titans' Biggest Weakness According to Eren, however, there was another cause for this awakening.

Home Anime Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing    Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing  By Dallas Marshall Published 2 days ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sakamoto Days has the feel of a manga from the '90s which may be off-putting to some, but there's more than enough hijinks and action to draw in fans.                 People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make \"easy money\" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: \"return to the assassin world, or die!\"  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.

People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make \"easy money\" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: \"return to the assassin world, or die!\"  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct. In a challenging world such as ours, sometimes folks need some comfort food -- even if it's all about crime and the bloodshed that comes with it.

Here's a look back at the anime's biggest plot twists so far.                 My Dress-Up Darling was a smash-hit rom-com anime in the Winter 2022 season, starring the lively cosplay enthusiast Kitagawa Marin and her new partner, the shy but hardworking Gojo Wakana. They soon embarked on an educational and uplifting journey into the world of cosplay together, and both gained a lot from it.  The story of My Dress-Up Darling is told in just 12 episodes, but it still managed to pack in some intriguing and meaningful plot twists and developments that kept the series moving at a healthy pace. Fans can look back fondly and remember the most impactful plot twists that helped the story and its characters along. RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022          When Gojo Agreed to Make a Shizuka-Tan Cosplay For Marin                When Gojo and Marin first met early in My Dress-Up Darling, Marin made a request: for Gojo the doll maker to become her cosplay expert and help her make a costume of her favorite Slippery Girls 2 character, Shizuka-Tan. This request is what helped forge their new friendship, and Gojo accepted the challenge with relish.  The project helped establish their friendship, but also showed how devoted Gojo is to his craft. He amazed Marin when he pushed himself to finish her cosplay in record time, which helped set the tone for his character going forward. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship          When Gojo Called Marin Beautiful                After Gojo worked so hard on her cosplay, Marin went ahead and attended a cosplay event where everyone was getting their picture taken. On the train ride home, Gojo off-handedly remarked on Marin's beauty, since he, as a hina doll maker, equates it with quality and good craftsmanship. In his eyes, Marin was like a high-quality, living hina doll -- but Marin took it differently.  This was a love confession to her ears, and it changed the tone of their platonic friendship. Flattered, Marin developed an immediate and innocent crush on Gojo and maintained those feelings throughout the show, to the point of becoming jealously possessive. She even made the trademark yandere stare at one point, though no one was around to see it. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes          When Gojo Combined His Two Hobbies To Improve His Skills                As My Dress-Up Darling continued, Gojo had to put his hina doll hobby on hold to make time for cosplay with Marin, and it was just as well. He had hit a wall with hina dolls after struggling to paint their faces correctly, but to his pleasant surprise, he learned that he could actually combine his hobbies.  By putting on Marin's cosplay makeup multiple times, Gojo became better at cosmetics, which meant he could paint hina doll faces better than ever. His hobbies had become more than the sum of their parts, boding well for his future with each hobby. Gojo's growth was quicker than many expected. RELATED: The My Dress-Up Darling Anime's Biggest Changes From the Manga          When Inui Sajuna Joined My Dress-Up Darling's Cast                Marin's cosplay role model and idol, the popular cosplayer Inui Sajuna, arrived to help Marin and Gojo take their hobby to the next level. In particular, she wanted Gojo to make a custom costume for her with his trademark quality. Along the way, Sajuna and her new friends learned much from one another.  Gojo and Marin both learned new strategies for costume creation and photography from Sajuna, while she in turn learned the value of homemade cosplay from Gojo and came to appreciate his expert technique. Having Sajuna was a distinct leap forward for Marin and Gojo's budding cosplay career together. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork          When Inui Shinju Decided To Cosplay, Too                Sajuna's little sister Shinju was content to be her supporter and little more, with the latter lacking the confidence to try cosplay on her own. After meeting Gojo and Marin, however, Shinju finally worked up the courage to try her first cosplay, showing remarkable character growth. She amazed everyone in My Dress-Up Darling with her crossplay as a dark-haired male anime character, and is now a confident cosplayer who is ready to show off what she can do to the world.

Go Rush\u2019s Card Game Mechanics for Old-School Fans  By Gregory Segal Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   With Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! set to release this month, it seems like a better time than any to go over the game rules, as they're quite different!                 The gameplay of Yu-Gi-Oh! has changed throughout its many anime series and the physical card game. From the number of life points characters have to the summoning mechanics and type of monsters playable, each rendition of the show has developed and added a variety of new features.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! will be building on the rules that were introduced in its previous season, Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS, which saw the game take a dramatic turn from the formats that each previous anime has followed. Unlike the traditional game fans know and love, Rush Duels offers a more simplified game style, similar to Speed Duels, that harkens back to the old-school days of the game. Since Yu-Gi-Oh SEVENS has yet to be released outside of Japan, many fans may still be unfamiliar with the new mechanics of the upcoming show, so here\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect. RELATED: Aharen-San's Premiere Episode Echoes Komi Can't Communicate's Shojo-Style Stor          What Changes To The Rules Have Been Made?                 The first thing that fans of the game will notice is that the duel field has been scaled down in size. Now, players only have three monster zones and spell and trap zones rather than the traditional five. Pendulum and Extra Monster zones no longer exist; however, this might be something that's developed within this new series. The mechanics for normal summoning monsters has also changed. Typically, characters have only been able to Normal Summon once per turn -- unless they\u2019re cheating to enhance the plot, which can be seen pretty often in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters. Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels allows characters to Normal Summon or Set as many monsters as they want within a single turn; however, all Level 5 or higher monsters still must be Tribute Summoned.  To balance this mechanic, all monster effects can only be activated once per turn while they are face up on the field. Although this has an impact on how players play in real life, it's unlikely to dramatically alter how cards are used in the show. RELATED: How Naruto\u2019s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's As both the name of the series and the card game it is based upon suggest, the pace of duels is much quicker than fans have come to expect. This means that not only can characters summon monsters at a faster pace, but the number of cards that they draw has also increased. Rather than getting one card per turn during the Draw Phase, players are able to continuously add cards to their hand from the top of their deck until they have five cards. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of cards a character can have in their hand.  Since this occurs each turn and characters will lose a duel if they run through their deck too quickly, every game will likely be a rush to see who can win before this happens. Fans of the show can likely expect to see a few close games in which one character loses simply due to their inability to draw. Other slight tweaks to the game have been made, although the rest of the rules have largely remained the same. Characters start with 4000-8000 LP and can only have 40-60 cards in their Main Deck. However, there are other innovations present when it comes to the summoning mechanics of certain monsters.  RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime          How Does Fusion Summoning Work?                 Over the course of Yu-Gi-Oh\u2019s history, fusion summoning has occurred in a plethora of different ways, from using the classic Polymerization card to unique Contact Fusions. Under the majority of circumstances, players are able to fuse monsters from their hands, field and sometimes even deck. However, in Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush!!, a fusion can only occur when monsters are on the player's field and the spell card \u201cfusion\u201d has been activated.          What\u2019s Maximum Summoning?                 Maximum Summoning is a mechanic that's exclusive to Rush Duels and was first introduced in Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS. Characters initiate this summon by having all three pieces of a Maximum Monster in their hand and either an empty field or the ability to send all monsters they control to the grave.  RELATED: Sasaki and Miyano: How to Get Started With the Anime and Manga The monster summoned is treated as a single card and can only attack once unless it's otherwise stated. If the monster is destroyed or returned to the hand, the rest of the pieces follow suit. However, the effects of each card can be activated separately and summoned individually. Similar to Link Monsters, Maximum Monsters do not have any Defense and cannot be changed to Defense Position. As Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! progresses, it's possible that new mechanics and rules will come into play. When looking at its counterpart, Speed Duels, it's reasonable to assume that as time goes on, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum and even Link Summoning will enter the game as characters discover new and exciting ways to duel each other. However, with space on the field being limited and Konami wanting to simplify the game for older fans of the show, it might be a while until this happens, if at all.

Go Rush\u2019s Card Game Mechanics for Old-School Fans    An Introduction to Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush\u2019s Card Game Mechanics for Old-School Fans  By Gregory Segal Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   With Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! set to release this month, it seems like a better time than any to go over the game rules, as they're quite different!                 The gameplay of Yu-Gi-Oh! has changed throughout its many anime series and the physical card game. From the number of life points characters have to the summoning mechanics and type of monsters playable, each rendition of the show has developed and added a variety of new features.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! will be building on the rules that were introduced in its previous season, Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS, which saw the game take a dramatic turn from the formats that each previous anime has followed. Unlike the traditional game fans know and love, Rush Duels offers a more simplified game style, similar to Speed Duels, that harkens back to the old-school days of the game. Since Yu-Gi-Oh SEVENS has yet to be released outside of Japan, many fans may still be unfamiliar with the new mechanics of the upcoming show, so here\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect. RELATED: Aharen-San's Premiere Episode Echoes Komi Can't Communicate's Shojo-Style Stor          What Changes To The Rules Have Been Made?                 The first thing that fans of the game will notice is that the duel field has been scaled down in size. Now, players only have three monster zones and spell and trap zones rather than the traditional five. Pendulum and Extra Monster zones no longer exist; however, this might be something that's developed within this new series. The mechanics for normal summoning monsters has also changed. Typically, characters have only been able to Normal Summon once per turn -- unless they\u2019re cheating to enhance the plot, which can be seen pretty often in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters. Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush Duels allows characters to Normal Summon or Set as many monsters as they want within a single turn; however, all Level 5 or higher monsters still must be Tribute Summoned.  To balance this mechanic, all monster effects can only be activated once per turn while they are face up on the field. Although this has an impact on how players play in real life, it's unlikely to dramatically alter how cards are used in the show. RELATED: How Naruto\u2019s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's As both the name of the series and the card game it is based upon suggest, the pace of duels is much quicker than fans have come to expect. This means that not only can characters summon monsters at a faster pace, but the number of cards that they draw has also increased. Rather than getting one card per turn during the Draw Phase, players are able to continuously add cards to their hand from the top of their deck until they have five cards. Moreover, there is no limit to the number of cards a character can have in their hand.  Since this occurs each turn and characters will lose a duel if they run through their deck too quickly, every game will likely be a rush to see who can win before this happens. Fans of the show can likely expect to see a few close games in which one character loses simply due to their inability to draw. Other slight tweaks to the game have been made, although the rest of the rules have largely remained the same. Characters start with 4000-8000 LP and can only have 40-60 cards in their Main Deck. However, there are other innovations present when it comes to the summoning mechanics of certain monsters.  RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime          How Does Fusion Summoning Work?                 Over the course of Yu-Gi-Oh\u2019s history, fusion summoning has occurred in a plethora of different ways, from using the classic Polymerization card to unique Contact Fusions. Under the majority of circumstances, players are able to fuse monsters from their hands, field and sometimes even deck. However, in Yu-Gi-Oh! Rush!!, a fusion can only occur when monsters are on the player's field and the spell card \u201cfusion\u201d has been activated.          What\u2019s Maximum Summoning?                 Maximum Summoning is a mechanic that's exclusive to Rush Duels and was first introduced in Yu-Gi-Oh! SEVENS. Characters initiate this summon by having all three pieces of a Maximum Monster in their hand and either an empty field or the ability to send all monsters they control to the grave.  RELATED: Sasaki and Miyano: How to Get Started With the Anime and Manga The monster summoned is treated as a single card and can only attack once unless it's otherwise stated. If the monster is destroyed or returned to the hand, the rest of the pieces follow suit. However, the effects of each card can be activated separately and summoned individually. Similar to Link Monsters, Maximum Monsters do not have any Defense and cannot be changed to Defense Position. As Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! progresses, it's possible that new mechanics and rules will come into play. When looking at its counterpart, Speed Duels, it's reasonable to assume that as time goes on, Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum and even Link Summoning will enter the game as characters discover new and exciting ways to duel each other. However, with space on the field being limited and Konami wanting to simplify the game for older fans of the show, it might be a while until this happens, if at all.

Adapting an anime to live-action is incredibly tricky \u2013 anime and film are two completely different worlds. The best a live-action take can do is capture the spirit of the anime it's bringing to life, but a good number of movies fail in this regard.  RELATED: 5 Anime That Have A Great Live-Action Adaptions (& 5 That Fell Flat) Whether it's misunderstanding the anime's style and themes or deliberately going against everything the original stood for, these live-action adaptations fell short for reasons beyond being unfaithful to the visuals or lore.  10          Bleach Had None Of The Anime's Punk Energy                 For all its flaws, Bleach continues to be a beloved anime because of its punk aesthetic and energy. Whether it was the character designs, episodes' direction, or promotional material, Bleach had a uniquely colorful edge that most anime hope to have. Shinsuke Sato's adaptation, however, dropped all of these stylistic choices.  The live-action Bleach was an urban fantasy that grounded the anime's outlandish moments and world in serious realism. Outside some colorful title cards that disappeared after the first act, the movie had little in the way of anarchic energy. The movie is fairly decent and was even approved by Tite Kubo, but It's nowhere near as wild as it should've been.  9          The Gintama Movies Only Captured The Anime's Costumes & Looks                 Gintama earned its reputation as the gag anime to beat, but almost none of its mastery of humor and parody was reflected in its two live action movies, Gintama and Gintama 2: Rules Are Made To Be Broken. At most, the movies looked more like live-action recreations of the anime's most popular skits as performed by some impressive cosplayers.  Yuichi Fukuda's adaptations were at their best when they made up new jokes and spoofed the fact that they were movies, but these moments were few and far between. Gintama became what it is by making its own brand of comedy separate from the already hilarious manga, but, unfortunately, none of this originality was used for the movies.  8          Lupin The 3rd Had None Of The Anime's Spirit & Originality                 Lupin The Third isn't just a landmark anime, but it's practically an institution as well. The anime, manga's style, and story continue to influence Japanese fiction today, which is why any new adaptation should strive to break new ground as its forerunners did. Unfortunately, Ryuhei Kitamura's critically-panned Lupin The 3rd failed to do so.   RELATED: 5 Anime & Manga Couples That Honestly Shouldn't Be Together At most, all this adaptation had were some text-accurate costumes, poses, and quotes. The movie was as derivative as any uninspired con movie before it, complete with a needlessly convoluted plot that confused confusion for intrigue. By not even trying to do anything new, Lupin The 3rd was just a legendary anime's surface-level reenactment.  7          Kite Was Not As Controversial & Stylish As The OVAs                 Without exaggeration, the Kite OVAs are some of the most controversial anime ever created. Besides the excessive gore, Sawa's time as an assassin was borderline pornographic \u2013 so much so that the OVA was banned in certain countries. Understandably, the live-action adaptation toned these parts down or cut them, but lost the original's spirit in doing so.  Ralph Ziman's Kite was as forgettable and pedestrian as a movie about hitmen could get. Worse, it came out at the time when movies starring female assassins like Lucy or Salt were oversaturated. Kite's biggest flaw wasn't its lack of offensive content, but its refusal to be as audacious and stylish as its infamous anime by doing anything risqu\u00e9.  6          Fist Of The North Star Lacked Its Source Material's Creativity & Scale                 At its heart, Fist Of The North Star is a martial arts-driven tale of revenge. That said, it more than made up for these familiar trappings by pushing everything to the extreme. Not only was the story set in the post-apocalypse, but Kenshiro was the latest master of the Hokuto Shinken style, which granted him the power to make enemies explode.  Few if any of the over-the-top aesthetics made it to the movie, which was as formulaic as a martial arts movie could get. Tony Randel's movie unwisely toned everything down, most egregiously seen in the fights that were nowhere near as bloody and exciting as their animated counterparts. At best, the sets were surprisingly well-made despite the low budget.  5          The Attack On Titan Two-Parter Was A Typical Zombie Apocalypse                 One of the many things that makes Attack On Titan the landmark it is today is that it bears one of the greatest bait-and-switch premises ever told. As it turns out, Paradis Island's war against the Titans wasn't the fight for humanity everyone thought it was, but a dark fate placed on an entire race of people that the world isolated and vilified.  The movies, however, were just another modern-day zombie apocalypse. In brief, the Titans were tall zombies born from failed weapons experiments, and they were stopped with a nuke. Whatever complexity the anime had (especially in themes of militarism, nationalism, racism, etc.) were simplified or dropped in Shinji Higuchi's B-grade two-parter.  4          City Hunter (1993) Was Just Another Jackie Chan Movie                 In the '90s, Jackie Chan became a star by headlining action-comedies about bumbling martial arts heroes who stumbled their way into larger conspiracies. City Hunter fit this bill perfectly, and therein lies the problem. If not for its source material's legacy, Wong Jing's adaptation would be indistinguishable from the likes of Mr. Nice Guy or Rumble In The Bronx.   All City Hunter got right were the characters' names and Ryo Saeba's comedic lechery. Though it had its moments, the movie was more of by-the-numbers Jackie Chan romp than an adaptation. Not helping matters is how City Hunter got the faithfully cartoonish adaptation it deserved in Philippe Lacheau's 2018 movie, which effectively supplanted Chan's.  3          Dragonball: Evolution Was A Highschool Adventure, Not A Galactic Epic                 Part of the reason why Dragon Ball is one of the most influential anime ever made is because of its seemingly bottomless depth of its world and Goku as a person. Goku wasn't just the Monkey King's parallel in this homage to the Chinese epic Journey To The West, he was also an intergalactic warrior, a loving father and friend, and the protector of Earth.  RELATED: Top 10 Worst Ways To Die In Dragon Ball For pragmatic and mostly cynical reasons, James Wong's Dragonball: Evolution scaled everything back. Here, Goku's quest for the Dragon Balls was a coming-of-age story that was more interested in his growth as a teen than the galaxy's defender. The movie didn't just lack the anime's grand scale, but also its stakes and development.  2          Ghost In The Shell Turned The Major Into A Generic Superhero                 Despite starring an iconic action star in Major Motoko Kusanagi, the original Ghost In The Shell was anything but a conventional action story. Instead, it was a meditation about the Major's existential and identity crisis in a technologically dominant world where she's both a cog in an unfeeling inhuman system and a mass-produced cyborg model.  In contrast, Rupert Sanders' movie was the Major's heroic origin story. Here, Major Mira Killian (a cyborg with the brain of the delinquent Motoko Kusanagi) was a one of a kind cyborg super-soldier who fought for justice. Even if it's watchable and momentarily ignoring the twist's racial implications, this movie was formulaic where the anime was anything but.  1          Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys Deconstructed Its Comedy                 In brief, Daigo Matsui's Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys is a deconstruction of the animated sitcom it was based on. The movie adapted some of the anime's most famous jokes and skits, but replaced the punchlines with depressing reality checks. Wacky situations ended with the boys getting reprimanded, or with them contemplating how stupid they acted.  Matsui did this because the manga and anime reminded him of his adolescence but, instead of nostalgia, he felt embarrassment and shame. His adaptation reflected his dour outlook, which undid everything that made the anime funny. Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys was one of the funniest shows of its time, and it deserved a movie better than this.                  10 Anime That Perfectly Balance Action & Comedy  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime bleach ghost in the shell ()     About The Author   Angelo Delos Trinos                                     (414 Articles Published)     CBR Staff Writer Angelo Delos Trinos' professional writing career may have only started a few years ago, but he's been writing and overthinking about anime, comics and movies for his whole life.

Adapting an anime to live-action is incredibly tricky \u2013 anime and film are two completely different worlds. The best a live-action take can do is capture the spirit of the anime it's bringing to life, but a good number of movies fail in this regard.  RELATED: 5 Anime That Have A Great Live-Action Adaptions (& 5 That Fell Flat) Whether it's misunderstanding the anime's style and themes or deliberately going against everything the original stood for, these live-action adaptations fell short for reasons beyond being unfaithful to the visuals or lore.  10          Bleach Had None Of The Anime's Punk Energy                 For all its flaws, Bleach continues to be a beloved anime because of its punk aesthetic and energy. Whether it was the character designs, episodes' direction, or promotional material, Bleach had a uniquely colorful edge that most anime hope to have. Shinsuke Sato's adaptation, however, dropped all of these stylistic choices.  The live-action Bleach was an urban fantasy that grounded the anime's outlandish moments and world in serious realism. Outside some colorful title cards that disappeared after the first act, the movie had little in the way of anarchic energy. The movie is fairly decent and was even approved by Tite Kubo, but It's nowhere near as wild as it should've been.  9          The Gintama Movies Only Captured The Anime's Costumes & Looks                 Gintama earned its reputation as the gag anime to beat, but almost none of its mastery of humor and parody was reflected in its two live action movies, Gintama and Gintama 2: Rules Are Made To Be Broken. At most, the movies looked more like live-action recreations of the anime's most popular skits as performed by some impressive cosplayers.  Yuichi Fukuda's adaptations were at their best when they made up new jokes and spoofed the fact that they were movies, but these moments were few and far between. Gintama became what it is by making its own brand of comedy separate from the already hilarious manga, but, unfortunately, none of this originality was used for the movies.  8          Lupin The 3rd Had None Of The Anime's Spirit & Originality                 Lupin The Third isn't just a landmark anime, but it's practically an institution as well. The anime, manga's style, and story continue to influence Japanese fiction today, which is why any new adaptation should strive to break new ground as its forerunners did. Unfortunately, Ryuhei Kitamura's critically-panned Lupin The 3rd failed to do so.   RELATED: 5 Anime & Manga Couples That Honestly Shouldn't Be Together At most, all this adaptation had were some text-accurate costumes, poses, and quotes. The movie was as derivative as any uninspired con movie before it, complete with a needlessly convoluted plot that confused confusion for intrigue. By not even trying to do anything new, Lupin The 3rd was just a legendary anime's surface-level reenactment.  7          Kite Was Not As Controversial & Stylish As The OVAs                 Without exaggeration, the Kite OVAs are some of the most controversial anime ever created. Besides the excessive gore, Sawa's time as an assassin was borderline pornographic \u2013 so much so that the OVA was banned in certain countries. Understandably, the live-action adaptation toned these parts down or cut them, but lost the original's spirit in doing so.  Ralph Ziman's Kite was as forgettable and pedestrian as a movie about hitmen could get. Worse, it came out at the time when movies starring female assassins like Lucy or Salt were oversaturated. Kite's biggest flaw wasn't its lack of offensive content, but its refusal to be as audacious and stylish as its infamous anime by doing anything risqu\u00e9.  6          Fist Of The North Star Lacked Its Source Material's Creativity & Scale                 At its heart, Fist Of The North Star is a martial arts-driven tale of revenge. That said, it more than made up for these familiar trappings by pushing everything to the extreme. Not only was the story set in the post-apocalypse, but Kenshiro was the latest master of the Hokuto Shinken style, which granted him the power to make enemies explode.  Few if any of the over-the-top aesthetics made it to the movie, which was as formulaic as a martial arts movie could get. Tony Randel's movie unwisely toned everything down, most egregiously seen in the fights that were nowhere near as bloody and exciting as their animated counterparts. At best, the sets were surprisingly well-made despite the low budget.  5          The Attack On Titan Two-Parter Was A Typical Zombie Apocalypse                 One of the many things that makes Attack On Titan the landmark it is today is that it bears one of the greatest bait-and-switch premises ever told. As it turns out, Paradis Island's war against the Titans wasn't the fight for humanity everyone thought it was, but a dark fate placed on an entire race of people that the world isolated and vilified.  The movies, however, were just another modern-day zombie apocalypse. In brief, the Titans were tall zombies born from failed weapons experiments, and they were stopped with a nuke. Whatever complexity the anime had (especially in themes of militarism, nationalism, racism, etc.) were simplified or dropped in Shinji Higuchi's B-grade two-parter.  4          City Hunter (1993) Was Just Another Jackie Chan Movie                 In the '90s, Jackie Chan became a star by headlining action-comedies about bumbling martial arts heroes who stumbled their way into larger conspiracies. City Hunter fit this bill perfectly, and therein lies the problem. If not for its source material's legacy, Wong Jing's adaptation would be indistinguishable from the likes of Mr. Nice Guy or Rumble In The Bronx.   All City Hunter got right were the characters' names and Ryo Saeba's comedic lechery. Though it had its moments, the movie was more of by-the-numbers Jackie Chan romp than an adaptation. Not helping matters is how City Hunter got the faithfully cartoonish adaptation it deserved in Philippe Lacheau's 2018 movie, which effectively supplanted Chan's.  3          Dragonball: Evolution Was A Highschool Adventure, Not A Galactic Epic                 Part of the reason why Dragon Ball is one of the most influential anime ever made is because of its seemingly bottomless depth of its world and Goku as a person. Goku wasn't just the Monkey King's parallel in this homage to the Chinese epic Journey To The West, he was also an intergalactic warrior, a loving father and friend, and the protector of Earth.  RELATED: Top 10 Worst Ways To Die In Dragon Ball For pragmatic and mostly cynical reasons, James Wong's Dragonball: Evolution scaled everything back. Here, Goku's quest for the Dragon Balls was a coming-of-age story that was more interested in his growth as a teen than the galaxy's defender. The movie didn't just lack the anime's grand scale, but also its stakes and development.  2          Ghost In The Shell Turned The Major Into A Generic Superhero                 Despite starring an iconic action star in Major Motoko Kusanagi, the original Ghost In The Shell was anything but a conventional action story. Instead, it was a meditation about the Major's existential and identity crisis in a technologically dominant world where she's both a cog in an unfeeling inhuman system and a mass-produced cyborg model.  In contrast, Rupert Sanders' movie was the Major's heroic origin story. Here, Major Mira Killian (a cyborg with the brain of the delinquent Motoko Kusanagi) was a one of a kind cyborg super-soldier who fought for justice. Even if it's watchable and momentarily ignoring the twist's racial implications, this movie was formulaic where the anime was anything but.  1          Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys Deconstructed Its Comedy                 In brief, Daigo Matsui's Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys is a deconstruction of the animated sitcom it was based on. The movie adapted some of the anime's most famous jokes and skits, but replaced the punchlines with depressing reality checks. Wacky situations ended with the boys getting reprimanded, or with them contemplating how stupid they acted.  Matsui did this because the manga and anime reminded him of his adolescence but, instead of nostalgia, he felt embarrassment and shame. His adaptation reflected his dour outlook, which undid everything that made the anime funny. Daily Lives Of Highschool Boys was one of the funniest shows of its time, and it deserved a movie better than this.                  10 Anime That Perfectly Balance Action & Comedy  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Anime bleach ghost in the shell ()     About The Author   Angelo Delos Trinos                                     (414 Articles Published)     CBR Staff Writer Angelo Delos Trinos' professional writing career may have only started a few years ago, but he's been writing and overthinking about anime, comics and movies for his whole life.

Home TV TV News Doctor Who Reveals Spinoff Podcast Series Featuring the Thirteenth Doctor    Doctor Who Reveals Spinoff Podcast Series Featuring the Thirteenth Doctor  By Ben Wasserman Published 11 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The first-ever Doctor Who podcast story, Doctor Who Redacted, featuring Jodie Whittaker, announces its debut episode's release date and premise.                 Jodie Whittaker might only have a few Doctor Who episodes left before she regenerates, but the Thirteenth Doctor is about to receive even more adventures in podcast form.  The official Doctor Who website announced that Episode 1 of a ten-part podcast series called Doctor Who Redacted will drop on April 17, the same day as the 2022 special episode \"Legend of the Sea Devils.\" Instead of being directly Doctor-centric, Redacted follows \"three broke university drop-outs\" and podcast co-hosts Cleo Proctor (Charlie Craggs), Abby McPhail (Lois Chimimba) and Shawna Thompson (Holly Quin-Ankrah), whose series \"The Blue Box Files\" analyzes the reoccurrence of a mysterious object (i.e. the Doctor's TARDIS) throughout historical records. However, Cleo, Abby and Shawna soon become the universe's best chance at survival, thanks ironically to poor viewership numbers, after getting \"caught in a supernatural conspiracy as they learn that everyone who\u2019s ever met the Doctor is disappearing and being forgotten.\"  RELATED: Is It Time for Doctor Who to Bring Back Its Oldest Companion? In addition to Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, Craggs, Chimimba, and Quin-Ankrah's characters will meet some notable allies from past Doctor Who stories. These include UNIT Chief Scientific Officer Kate Stewart, scientist Petronella Osgood, Silurian Madame Vastra, and The Sarah Jane Adventures' Rani Chandra. Also joining the cast is Jacob Hawley as Cleo's brother Jordan, who is amongst those mysteriously \"redacted\" by the Doctor's newest foe. Whittaker debuted as the Thirteenth Doctor in 2018, becoming the first woman to portray the iconic Time Lord since Doctor Who began nearly sixty years ago. She's played the Doctor across three seasons, sharing a record with predecessors Peter Capaldi's and Matt Smith's Twelfth and Eleventh Doctors, respectively. However, instead of the modern Who's 13-episode series run, Whittaker's Doctor had two ten-episode series, followed by a six-part mini-seres Doctor Who Flux. The latest series saw the Doctor and longtime ally Yasmin Khan work together with multiple parties across space and time, including new companion Dan Lewis, to stop a threat from her past consuming the entire universe. Whittaker also voiced the Thirteenth Doctor in multiple video games, with the most recent one, Doctor Who: Edge of Reality, pairing her up with a returning David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor.  RELATED: Who Was The War Doctor in Doctor Who? \"Legend of the Sea Devils\" marks the titular reptilian Earth natives' return to Doctor Who for the first time since the Third Doctor era. The spring special will be followed up by Whittaker's final episode, for which the release date is not yet known. So far, no details have come out yet regarding the choice of Whittaker's replacement. It was rumored earlier this year that Hugh Grant was in consideration to play the Fourteenth Doctor, but the actor has since debunked that claim. Doctor Who Redacted will be available on BBC Sounds starting April 17.

Jodie Whittaker might only have a few Doctor Who episodes left before she regenerates, but the Thirteenth Doctor is about to receive even more adventures in podcast form.  The official Doctor Who website announced that Episode 1 of a ten-part podcast series called Doctor Who Redacted will drop on April 17, the same day as the 2022 special episode \"Legend of the Sea Devils.\" Instead of being directly Doctor-centric, Redacted follows \"three broke university drop-outs\" and podcast co-hosts Cleo Proctor (Charlie Craggs), Abby McPhail (Lois Chimimba) and Shawna Thompson (Holly Quin-Ankrah), whose series \"The Blue Box Files\" analyzes the reoccurrence of a mysterious object (i.e. the Doctor's TARDIS) throughout historical records. However, Cleo, Abby and Shawna soon become the universe's best chance at survival, thanks ironically to poor viewership numbers, after getting \"caught in a supernatural conspiracy as they learn that everyone who\u2019s ever met the Doctor is disappearing and being forgotten.\"  RELATED: Is It Time for Doctor Who to Bring Back Its Oldest Companion? In addition to Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, Craggs, Chimimba, and Quin-Ankrah's characters will meet some notable allies from past Doctor Who stories. These include UNIT Chief Scientific Officer Kate Stewart, scientist Petronella Osgood, Silurian Madame Vastra, and The Sarah Jane Adventures' Rani Chandra. Also joining the cast is Jacob Hawley as Cleo's brother Jordan, who is amongst those mysteriously \"redacted\" by the Doctor's newest foe. Whittaker debuted as the Thirteenth Doctor in 2018, becoming the first woman to portray the iconic Time Lord since Doctor Who began nearly sixty years ago. She's played the Doctor across three seasons, sharing a record with predecessors Peter Capaldi's and Matt Smith's Twelfth and Eleventh Doctors, respectively. However, instead of the modern Who's 13-episode series run, Whittaker's Doctor had two ten-episode series, followed by a six-part mini-seres Doctor Who Flux. The latest series saw the Doctor and longtime ally Yasmin Khan work together with multiple parties across space and time, including new companion Dan Lewis, to stop a threat from her past consuming the entire universe. Whittaker also voiced the Thirteenth Doctor in multiple video games, with the most recent one, Doctor Who: Edge of Reality, pairing her up with a returning David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor.  RELATED: Who Was The War Doctor in Doctor Who? \"Legend of the Sea Devils\" marks the titular reptilian Earth natives' return to Doctor Who for the first time since the Third Doctor era. The spring special will be followed up by Whittaker's final episode, for which the release date is not yet known. So far, no details have come out yet regarding the choice of Whittaker's replacement. It was rumored earlier this year that Hugh Grant was in consideration to play the Fourteenth Doctor, but the actor has since debunked that claim. Doctor Who Redacted will be available on BBC Sounds starting April 17.

Home Anime One-Punch Man: Saitama Reaches Peak Anger - for an Unsurprising Reason    One-Punch Man: Saitama Reaches Peak Anger - for an Unsurprising Reason  By Christian Markle Published 2 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Saitama is known for his lack of emotions in tense situations. In One-Punch Man Chapter 159, he surprisingly expresses immense anger.                  The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   Saitama is known for not being fazed by any threat or danger. He maintains a poker face, even in front of possible Earth-destroying catastrophe -- like when he fought Boros the alien invader or Monster King Orochi. However, that doesn't mean he is an unfeeling robot. There are some cases in which he is actually angered, but only in Chapter 159 has he reached the peak of hatred.  With the amount of power Saitama possesses, there's no longer anything that poses a threat to him. He simply decimates anything that stands in his way with a single punch, hence, the title of the manga. He is, however, not without weaknesses. He is often flustered for missing out on sales and is always problematizing his budget, and the Monster Association's wide-scale attack finally brought out the worst in him. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died                 The first question Saitama asked the monsterized Garo was confirmation of his identity, which the Hero Hunter provided. He then launched into a long rant about being the absolute evil, but Saitama was no longer interested in what the monster had to say. Because he deemed Garo not to be a monster, despite the Hero Hunter's admittance, he was convinced there was nothing left for him to do there, leaving Garo surprised and confused..  Before leaving, though, Saitama ranted for a bit, recalling going out of his place to report the recurring noise. However, his house got destroyed, and he now had to go look for his belongings. Saitama expressed his frustration at the situation, claiming he was so angry he could destroy the world. Saitama's outburst wasn't just a bluff, because Garo felt immense pressure when the bald hero made the declaration. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task                 Saitama getting angry is a rare occurrence, and this is the first time he reached a world-destroying level of anger. Unsurprisingly, the cause of his fury is not something heavy like losing a friend or witnessing great evil. Rather, it has something to do with his belongings. Saitama has always been concerned about things ordinary individuals will consider trivial -- like supermarket sales and winning against King in a video game. It is, however, interesting to see him express an emotion to that extreme.  Saitama has always been shown to be a calm-headed individual who couldn't feel any sense of danger, so seeing him in a fit of immense rage is a rare occurrence. If there's any moral lesson this teaches the audience, then it's that nobody should mess with Saitama's belongings under any circumstances.

In One-Punch Man Chapter 159, he surprisingly expresses immense anger.                  The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   Saitama is known for not being fazed by any threat or danger. He maintains a poker face, even in front of possible Earth-destroying catastrophe -- like when he fought Boros the alien invader or Monster King Orochi. However, that doesn't mean he is an unfeeling robot. There are some cases in which he is actually angered, but only in Chapter 159 has he reached the peak of hatred.  With the amount of power Saitama possesses, there's no longer anything that poses a threat to him. He simply decimates anything that stands in his way with a single punch, hence, the title of the manga. He is, however, not without weaknesses. He is often flustered for missing out on sales and is always problematizing his budget, and the Monster Association's wide-scale attack finally brought out the worst in him. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died                 The first question Saitama asked the monsterized Garo was confirmation of his identity, which the Hero Hunter provided. He then launched into a long rant about being the absolute evil, but Saitama was no longer interested in what the monster had to say. Because he deemed Garo not to be a monster, despite the Hero Hunter's admittance, he was convinced there was nothing left for him to do there, leaving Garo surprised and confused..  Before leaving, though, Saitama ranted for a bit, recalling going out of his place to report the recurring noise. However, his house got destroyed, and he now had to go look for his belongings. Saitama expressed his frustration at the situation, claiming he was so angry he could destroy the world. Saitama's outburst wasn't just a bluff, because Garo felt immense pressure when the bald hero made the declaration. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task                 Saitama getting angry is a rare occurrence, and this is the first time he reached a world-destroying level of anger. Unsurprisingly, the cause of his fury is not something heavy like losing a friend or witnessing great evil. Rather, it has something to do with his belongings. Saitama has always been concerned about things ordinary individuals will consider trivial -- like supermarket sales and winning against King in a video game. It is, however, interesting to see him express an emotion to that extreme.  Saitama has always been shown to be a calm-headed individual who couldn't feel any sense of danger, so seeing him in a fit of immense rage is a rare occurrence. If there's any moral lesson this teaches the audience, then it's that nobody should mess with Saitama's belongings under any circumstances.

By CBR Staff Published 3 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Kiyo in Kyoto is a show dedicated to teaching about Japanese culture, so can it also be entertaining?                 Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is a lesser-known anime that came out at the tail end of the 2021 winter season. As it was produced by NHK World-Japan, the show walks a fine line between being just a means of entertainment and a means of education. There's only one way to find out whether it's more for entertainment or education, and that's by looking at the contents of the show.  However, before diving into the information given throughout the show, it's good to have an understanding of the context of Kiyo In Kyoto. The series follows Kiyo and her friend Sumire, who are both from Aomori Prefecture and want to become maiko (traditional Japanese entertainers found in Kyoto). While Sumire goes on to train and becomes a maiko, the titular character becomes the cook for that maiko house instead. The show then goes on to cover information about both maiko and Japanese food culture. As the show is produced by NHK World-Japan, the international version of the well-known Japanese broadcasting news and entertainment site, it would make sense that Kiyo in Kyoto is all about culture.  RELATED: Restaurant to Another World Vol. 1 Puts Iyashikei Into Isekai                 It's time to dive into the cultural aspects of the show, starting with the way it depicts the life of maiko. The series mainly takes place in the titular maiko house in the area of Kyoto called Kagai, where all the maiko and their housemothers live together. The show takes viewers along Sumire's journey in becoming a maiko, showing the training process with many tidbits of cultural information. It talks about the processes such as the classes maiko take to learn song and dance, as well as differences between maiko in training and maiko who have already made their \"debut\". One of these differences is the type of sash or obi the girls wear.  As seen in Episode 4, it shows how a senior apprentice who has not yet debuted wears a \"half dangling sash,\" while a full maiko wears a longer \"dangling sash.\" In that same episode, Sumire gets to debut as full-fledged maiko and gets her maiko name -- Momohana -- which they explain can be chosen in many ways. They can choose the Japanese characters for the maiko's name is by taking inspiration from their real names, from the maiko house they live in or even having it divined for them at a shrine. Along with all the information within the show, there is also a separate short video produced by NHK World-Japan called \"Maiko [Maiko-san Chi no Makanai-san - Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House] - 3-minute Maiko,\" available on YouTube, where real-life maiko are showcased.  RELATED: How Assassination Classroom Offers a Glimpse at Japan's Educational System Another topic that's discussed a lot in Kiyo in Kyoto is food, which means there's also a lot of information and facts about food not only from Kyoto or Aomori but from all around Japan. The episodes are formatted around the food featured in their respective segment, as each episode is generally formatted into three parts, each a chapter of the manga featuring one main food. Then, after each segment, there are little \"talking heads\" segments, where Kiyo and Sumire, as well as sometimes their senior Tsurukoma, talk about the food they ate in that segment as well as their regional counterparts.  This segment is called \"Sumire and Kiyo's Dish of the Day.\" A good example of the regional differences discussed during these scenes can be seen in the last segment of Episode 5, where the series talks about different soups from across Japan. It starts with the soup that was featured in the episode -- hittsumi soup from Aomori -- and goes on to talk about soups from other places, such as teppo soup from Hokkaido, natto soup from Yamagata and itoko soup from Kyoto. This kind of cultural analysis in these segments is common and very educational.                  Of course, to be an anime, the show must be entertaining as well, and entertaining it is. Kiyo in Kyoto has no lack of cute characters and scenes. Not everything in the show is meant to teach the viewer; it also contains a plot and characters that grow throughout, as well as numerous cute and fluffy scenes. The show can have both entertainment and educational elements within it, as many shows do. So, to answer whether Kiyo in Kyoto: From the Maiko House is an entertainment or an education series, it's happily both.                   Heaven's Design Team Mixes 'Edutainment' With...

Home Anime Shield Hero: Who Is the True Ruler of Melromarc?    Shield Hero: Who Is the True Ruler of Melromarc?  By Louis Kemner Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   One specific character is the true boss of the Melromarc kingdom in The Rising of the Shield Hero - and an ally of Naofumi's.                 The Rising of the Shield Hero is a grim but exciting isekai anime starring the unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi, the titular shield-bearing hero who must save the Melromarc kingdom from Waves of monsters. At first it seemed no one in the royal court was on Naofumi's side, but that soon changed when the queen showed up.  Naofumi had a terrible experience with King Aultclay XXXII and his daughter, Princess Malty, but Queen Mirellia Melromarc is a different story. Her worldview and policies differ greatly from her scheming husband's, and she played a much bigger role in the later sequences of Season 1. This may continue well into Season 2 of Shield Hero as well. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          The Fair Rule Of Queen Mirellia Melromarc                Shield Hero's Melromarc kingdom is a matrilineal nation, meaning the royal bloodline is carried through the women while men such as Aultclay marry into the family. This means Queen Mirellia wields the most power in Melromarc, but when Naofumi arrived with the other three Cardinal Heroes, she was nowhere to be seen. This led to a bad start for Naofumi's adventure, since King Aultclay and Princess Malty were scheming with the Church of Three Heroes to tarnish the Shield Hero's name forever. This scheme could have been uncovered and dealt with much sooner had the queen been there, since she is a fair and honorable ruler who doesn't share her husband and elder daughter's hatred of the Shield Hero.  There's more than a personal difference between the queen, king and elder princess, however. The three royals are split because of international and race politics as well, all based on the presence of demi-humans in the Melromarc kingdom and the historic role of the Shield Hero. In previous eras, the Shield Hero was a symbol of hope for the demi-humans, and in the modern era, Mirellia is also sympathetic to both parties rather than being prejudiced against anyone. This is why she accepted the tanuki-like Raphtalia as the Shield Hero's companion without complaint. Unlike the rest of the royal family, Mirellia -- and her younger daughter Melty -- seek to unite the four heroes and make use of the Shield Hero, rather than ostracize him because of race relations between humans and demi-humans. Queen Mirellia is a symbol of hope and tolerance in the eyes of demi-humans, which puts her at odds with her family and even the non-Shield heroes at times. But as Season 1 of Shield Hero showed, this all set her up as Naofumi's most powerful ally.  RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept          How Queen Mirellia Aided Naofumi In Shield Hero Season 1                Queen Mirellia didn't appear at first in The Rising of the Shield Hero, but did make some cameo appearances along with her Shadow agents until being formally introduced later on. Mirellia helped uncover the Church of Three Heroes' plot with the king, and personally oversaw the trial where King Aultclay and Princess Malty were found guilty of conspiracy. Given Mirellia's influence and the quality of her investigation into the matter, this helped clear Naofumi's name beyond all about -- even the oafish Motoyasu was forced to recognize the Queen's words and turn against Malty. Mirellia was even prepared to execute the king and princess until Naofumi intervened and decided to punish them with humiliation and a loss of authority instead.  RELATED: Shield Hero: The Berserk-Style Power of Naofumi's Rage Shield Mirellia came to Naofumi's aid soon after the would-be \"beach episode\" at the Cal Mira archipelago, when an unexpected Wave arrived. Unlike the previous Waves, this would be a naval battle, and Mirellia personally led a small fleet of warships and soldiers to aid the four Cardinal Heroes in battle against a series of sea monsters. The queen proved her worth as a leader of men in that battle, commanding her fleet with a steady hand as the Cardinal Heroes took the lead against the Wave's strongest monsters.  The battle was a success, and Queen Mirellia will continue to aid Naofumi however she can against future Waves and other quests in Season 2. With a further authority to mobilize the other three Cardinal Heroes to help, Mirella is now poised to take center stage alongside Naofumi as Shield Hero continues.

Shield Hero: Who Is the True Ruler of Melromarc?  By Louis Kemner Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   One specific character is the true boss of the Melromarc kingdom in The Rising of the Shield Hero - and an ally of Naofumi's.                 The Rising of the Shield Hero is a grim but exciting isekai anime starring the unfortunate protagonist Iwatani Naofumi, the titular shield-bearing hero who must save the Melromarc kingdom from Waves of monsters. At first it seemed no one in the royal court was on Naofumi's side, but that soon changed when the queen showed up.  Naofumi had a terrible experience with King Aultclay XXXII and his daughter, Princess Malty, but Queen Mirellia Melromarc is a different story. Her worldview and policies differ greatly from her scheming husband's, and she played a much bigger role in the later sequences of Season 1. This may continue well into Season 2 of Shield Hero as well. RELATED: Meet The Rising of the Shield Hero's Main Characters          The Fair Rule Of Queen Mirellia Melromarc                Shield Hero's Melromarc kingdom is a matrilineal nation, meaning the royal bloodline is carried through the women while men such as Aultclay marry into the family. This means Queen Mirellia wields the most power in Melromarc, but when Naofumi arrived with the other three Cardinal Heroes, she was nowhere to be seen. This led to a bad start for Naofumi's adventure, since King Aultclay and Princess Malty were scheming with the Church of Three Heroes to tarnish the Shield Hero's name forever. This scheme could have been uncovered and dealt with much sooner had the queen been there, since she is a fair and honorable ruler who doesn't share her husband and elder daughter's hatred of the Shield Hero.  There's more than a personal difference between the queen, king and elder princess, however. The three royals are split because of international and race politics as well, all based on the presence of demi-humans in the Melromarc kingdom and the historic role of the Shield Hero. In previous eras, the Shield Hero was a symbol of hope for the demi-humans, and in the modern era, Mirellia is also sympathetic to both parties rather than being prejudiced against anyone. This is why she accepted the tanuki-like Raphtalia as the Shield Hero's companion without complaint. Unlike the rest of the royal family, Mirellia -- and her younger daughter Melty -- seek to unite the four heroes and make use of the Shield Hero, rather than ostracize him because of race relations between humans and demi-humans. Queen Mirellia is a symbol of hope and tolerance in the eyes of demi-humans, which puts her at odds with her family and even the non-Shield heroes at times. But as Season 1 of Shield Hero showed, this all set her up as Naofumi's most powerful ally.  RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept          How Queen Mirellia Aided Naofumi In Shield Hero Season 1                Queen Mirellia didn't appear at first in The Rising of the Shield Hero, but did make some cameo appearances along with her Shadow agents until being formally introduced later on. Mirellia helped uncover the Church of Three Heroes' plot with the king, and personally oversaw the trial where King Aultclay and Princess Malty were found guilty of conspiracy. Given Mirellia's influence and the quality of her investigation into the matter, this helped clear Naofumi's name beyond all about -- even the oafish Motoyasu was forced to recognize the Queen's words and turn against Malty. Mirellia was even prepared to execute the king and princess until Naofumi intervened and decided to punish them with humiliation and a loss of authority instead.  RELATED: Shield Hero: The Berserk-Style Power of Naofumi's Rage Shield Mirellia came to Naofumi's aid soon after the would-be \"beach episode\" at the Cal Mira archipelago, when an unexpected Wave arrived. Unlike the previous Waves, this would be a naval battle, and Mirellia personally led a small fleet of warships and soldiers to aid the four Cardinal Heroes in battle against a series of sea monsters. The queen proved her worth as a leader of men in that battle, commanding her fleet with a steady hand as the Cardinal Heroes took the lead against the Wave's strongest monsters.  The battle was a success, and Queen Mirellia will continue to aid Naofumi however she can against future Waves and other quests in Season 2. With a further authority to mobilize the other three Cardinal Heroes to help, Mirella is now poised to take center stage alongside Naofumi as Shield Hero continues.

Dr. Stone is an edutainment anime series taking place in a far-future Stone Age where human civilization has long since rusted away, yielding to a primitive world of stone and the rule of the strong. Protagonist Ishigami Senku has other ideas, however. As a hopeful shonen hero, he's certain he can bring civilization back and usher in a better future.  Overall, Senku has little overlap with more traditional shonen heroes such as the rubbery pirate Luffy or even the sorcerer Itadori Yuji. Instead, Dr. Stone's lead is more like shonen's Batman -- without the gothic themes or personal angst. Senku is a merciful, resourceful and law-oriented hero who fights brutal villains with brains instead of brawn, making him worthy of any DC comic title. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen Anime          How Senku Built His Own Bat Family In Dr. Stone                Dr. Stone's Senku has many startling parallels with the Dark Knight, even if their personalities, settings and personal backstories differ greatly. In fact, not only is Senku a surprisingly accurate anime analog for Batman, he even has an entire Bat Family of his own: a group of trustworthy friends who all work together to help get the job done right.  To begin with, Senku recruited the curious \"sorcerer\" Chrome, who soon became his enthusiastic scientist apprentice similar to Batman taking on Jason Todd/Robin as his sidekick. Like Robin, Chrome is largely content to play second fiddle -- though he sometimes enjoys showing off his inventions, including re-creating 21st century devices without even realizing it. Senku then recruited his own Catwoman, the agile warrior/hunter Kohaku, who is personally loyal to him but also committed to her own cause. In this case, Kohaku has strong ties to her native Ishigami Village and her elder sister Ruri, the village priestess. Just the way Catwoman is sometimes Batman's ally and lover, Kohaku helps Senku whenever she can, though their relationship is largely platonic.  RELATED: Dr. Stone's Final Chapter Turns Senku Into Terminator's John Connor Senku, as the Stone Age Batman, also has his own Lucius Fox: the elderly craftsman Kaseki, who can build just about anything. Just the way Lucius helps Batman purchase or create new weapons and gadgets, Kaseki aids Senku by expertly crafting items such as glass flasks and thin strands of gold wire, and indeed, Senku wouldn't have gotten very far without him. Batman is an expert at using his tools, but not even he can invent everything himself. Finally, Senku gathered all these allies into his own bat cave -- his Kingdom of Science -- complete with its own flag. This secluded miniature kingdom was kept apart from Ishigami Village and Tsukasa's Empire of Might, which could each be considered Gotham City. Senku is committed to uniting all people under his banner of justice to create a better future, but he can only do so if he keeps his distance and can work in secret. Every hero needs their own bat cave.  RELATED: Nami and Kalifa Battle in New One Piece Illustration By Dr. Stone Artist          Ishigami Senku As Batman In Dr. Stone                 Many facets of Senku's character and various scenes or instances in Dr. Stone clearly establish him as the Batman of modern shonen. He's a crafty inventor who relies on brains rather than brawn to defeat his mighty foes, and he shares Batman's sense of mercy and compassion. Neither will take a life for any reason, and they aren't too fond of deadly weapons either. Both are stubbornly optimistic that they can bloodlessly defeat their foes to create a better future for all, either in the Stone Age or Gotham, and this has inspired other people to join them with the power of friendship.  By recruiting Chrome as his own Robin and Kohaku as Catwoman, Senku quickly built up his own bat family -- especially when Kaseki joined the crew and, later, the entirety of Ishigami Village. It wasn't easy though; Senku had to fight his own Bane more than once, such as the thuggish Magma and certainly Tsukasa, having to use his Batman-style wits and inventions to win the day without brute force or bloodshed. He and his \"bat family\" defeated Magma to make Senku the tribe's chief, and that in turn allowed Senku to administer medicine to the afflicted Ruri. The Stone Wars later began, and Senku reinvented walkie talkies and flash-bang grenades to compensate for his team's lack of strength against Tsukasa's own forces. In fact, the Dr. Stone protagonist even created a steam-powered car with bamboo weave tires as a battering ram, thus creating his own Batmobile in the Stone Age to win the day. That's a Batman anime moment if there ever was one.

Home Movies Movie Features How Tim Burton's Batman Beat Joker to a Major Origin Story Achievement    How Tim Burton's Batman Beat Joker to a Major Origin Story Achievement  By Robert Vaux Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   2019's Oscar-winning Joker received criticism for something Tim Burton did decades before in 1989's Batman: tell the Clown Prince's origin story.                 \"If I have to have a past, then I prefer it to be multiple choice!\" The Joker cackles in 1988\u2019s The Killing Joke, the seminal comic written by Alan Moore, illustrated by Brian Bolland and colored by John Higgins. It\u2019s a typically clever opt-out from Moore, who \u2013 tasked with creating a background story for Batman's greatest nemesis \u2013 ensured that his take couldn\u2019t be considered definitive. It was part of what\u2019s become a deliberately obtuse background for The Joker, whose true origins have yet to be definitively tracked down.  One of the criticisms levels against the 2019 movie Joker was precisely that it illuminated what had become so much fun to leave obscured. Some fans believed \u2013 not without justification \u2013 that the character didn\u2019t need a backstory and that the tangle of varying explanations for how he came to be fit him like a glove. 2008\u2019s The Dark Knight made direct reference to his slippery past, as Heath Ledger\u2019s version of the character constantly changed the story of how he got the scars on his face. It was easy to forget that Tim Burton had already delivered a \"definitive\" origin three decades earlier with the original Batman and just one year after Moore\u2019s indelible line.  RELATED: What Drives The Batman\u2019s Joker to Laughter?                 Before The Killing Joke, the closest thing to an origin story in the comics came in Detective Comics #168 in 1951. It reveals the now-familiar story of The Red Hood Gang, whose leader wore a crimson bubble over his head. He fell into a vat of chemicals at the Ace Chemicals Plant during an attempted robbery broken up by the Batman, and while the hood\u2019s protective features allowed him to survive, the chemicals turned his hair green and his skin white. He decided to abandon the Red Hood guise and adopt the identity of The Joker. Tim Burton used a similar version of that story in his 1989 movie. He simply did away with the notion of The Red Hood and made the Joker-to-be a mob lieutenant named Jack Napier. Batman arrives in the middle of a robbery attempt at Ace Chemicals and drops Napier into a vat \u2013 likely in revenge for the murder of his parents, whom Napier also killed \u2013 only to have the gangster re-emerge as the white-skinned Clown Prince of Crime. Jack Nicholson\u2019s performance proved iconic, and the film introduced an entire generation of fans to both the Caped Crusader and his grinning archenemy. The origin story lingered, overlapping with Paul Dini\u2019s Batman: The Animated Series among other properties and informing subsequent versions of the character on several occasions.  RELATED: The Batman\u2019s Deleted Scene Makes Heath Ledger\u2019s Iconic Joker Trait Even Scarier                 The Killing Joke didn\u2019t so much change the origin story as give it a more tragic introduction. It depicts The Red Hood as a struggling stand-up comic who agrees to serve as the gang's figurehead during a crime to support his pregnant wife. As he prepares for the robbery, she and their unborn child are killed in a household accident. The criminals he\u2019s associated with force him to go through the crime anyway, which is when Batman arrives. The guards shoot his accomplices, and he jumps into the chemicals to avoid the vigilante. When he emerges and discovers that his skin and hair have changed, the weight of events drives him completely insane.  That\u2019s the version Joker cleaves most closely to, though it has its own take on the notion. Its protean Joker \u2013 named Arthur Fleck here \u2013 similarly fails as a comedian and struggles to make ends meet. He also possesses a neurological disorder that results in fits of uncontrollable laughter. He commits murder on a subway when a group of rich young rakes assaults him, then smothers his mother when he learns that she lied to him about his birth father. It takes the pathos of Moore\u2019s figure \u2013 a normal man who had \"one bad day\" \u2013 and applies it to a realistic 1970s Gotham.  That\u2019s enough to make it distinctive, which was the filmmakers' goal, but its gritty delivery of a very strong origin story was hardly the first.

It\u2019s a typically clever opt-out from Moore, who \u2013 tasked with creating a background story for Batman's greatest nemesis \u2013 ensured that his take couldn\u2019t be considered definitive. It was part of what\u2019s become a deliberately obtuse background for The Joker, whose true origins have yet to be definitively tracked down.  One of the criticisms levels against the 2019 movie Joker was precisely that it illuminated what had become so much fun to leave obscured. Some fans believed \u2013 not without justification \u2013 that the character didn\u2019t need a backstory and that the tangle of varying explanations for how he came to be fit him like a glove. 2008\u2019s The Dark Knight made direct reference to his slippery past, as Heath Ledger\u2019s version of the character constantly changed the story of how he got the scars on his face. It was easy to forget that Tim Burton had already delivered a \"definitive\" origin three decades earlier with the original Batman and just one year after Moore\u2019s indelible line.  RELATED: What Drives The Batman\u2019s Joker to Laughter?                 Before The Killing Joke, the closest thing to an origin story in the comics came in Detective Comics #168 in 1951. It reveals the now-familiar story of The Red Hood Gang, whose leader wore a crimson bubble over his head. He fell into a vat of chemicals at the Ace Chemicals Plant during an attempted robbery broken up by the Batman, and while the hood\u2019s protective features allowed him to survive, the chemicals turned his hair green and his skin white. He decided to abandon the Red Hood guise and adopt the identity of The Joker. Tim Burton used a similar version of that story in his 1989 movie. He simply did away with the notion of The Red Hood and made the Joker-to-be a mob lieutenant named Jack Napier. Batman arrives in the middle of a robbery attempt at Ace Chemicals and drops Napier into a vat \u2013 likely in revenge for the murder of his parents, whom Napier also killed \u2013 only to have the gangster re-emerge as the white-skinned Clown Prince of Crime. Jack Nicholson\u2019s performance proved iconic, and the film introduced an entire generation of fans to both the Caped Crusader and his grinning archenemy. The origin story lingered, overlapping with Paul Dini\u2019s Batman: The Animated Series among other properties and informing subsequent versions of the character on several occasions.  RELATED: The Batman\u2019s Deleted Scene Makes Heath Ledger\u2019s Iconic Joker Trait Even Scarier                 The Killing Joke didn\u2019t so much change the origin story as give it a more tragic introduction. It depicts The Red Hood as a struggling stand-up comic who agrees to serve as the gang's figurehead during a crime to support his pregnant wife. As he prepares for the robbery, she and their unborn child are killed in a household accident. The criminals he\u2019s associated with force him to go through the crime anyway, which is when Batman arrives. The guards shoot his accomplices, and he jumps into the chemicals to avoid the vigilante. When he emerges and discovers that his skin and hair have changed, the weight of events drives him completely insane.  That\u2019s the version Joker cleaves most closely to, though it has its own take on the notion. Its protean Joker \u2013 named Arthur Fleck here \u2013 similarly fails as a comedian and struggles to make ends meet. He also possesses a neurological disorder that results in fits of uncontrollable laughter. He commits murder on a subway when a group of rich young rakes assaults him, then smothers his mother when he learns that she lied to him about his birth father. It takes the pathos of Moore\u2019s figure \u2013 a normal man who had \"one bad day\" \u2013 and applies it to a realistic 1970s Gotham.  That\u2019s enough to make it distinctive, which was the filmmakers' goal, but its gritty delivery of a very strong origin story was hardly the first. Burton delivered his Joker origin in a vastly different pop culture environment, and with two Oscar-winning retakes since then, the notion that either the \u201989 Batman or Joker could \"ruin\" the character with a definitive origin is absurd. Without Burton, no other Batman movie could have happened, and if his Joker origin couldn\u2019t stop alternates from cropping up, nothing will.

Home TV TV Features When Each Star Wars Rebels Season Takes Place in the Franchise Timeline    When Each Star Wars Rebels Season Takes Place in the Franchise Timeline  By Cara Smart Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Star Wars Rebels happens alongside important events in the Star Wars universe, making it difficult to figure out the show's place in canon.                 The most underrated Star Wars animated series is Star Wars Rebels; however, it can also be the most difficult to figure out. Star Wars has had a habit of jumping across the timeline with its various projects (and sometimes within them) and Rebels is no different. That makes it hard for viewers to pinpoint exactly when in canon the events of the series happen.  But Rebels is very important to Star Wars, and its importance will continue to grow with the arrival of the Ahsoka series. Not only is the show meant as a sequel to the wildly popular animated series The Clone Wars, it also fills the gap between Episode III and Episode IV, while holding on to fan-favorite characters from Clone Wars in the process. With that in mind, it's important to know what happened when, and here's the best possible estimation (with \"BBY\" standing for before the Battle of Yavin). RELATED: Jabba the Hutt Might Have Lived Longer Than Yoda - If It Weren't for Leia          Season 1 - 5-4 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 The first season occurs from around 5BBY to 4BBY, and only one event situates things in the greater Star Wars timeline, but it's a very important one. Jyn Erso (seen in Star Wars: Rogue One) is abandoned by Saw Gerrera around 5BBY, starting the arc that led her to aiding in destroying the Death Star. She sacrifices herself on Scarif to ensure the Death Star's collapse in the same year as the Battle of Yavin. RELATED: Star Wars' Ahsoka Series Adds Birds of Prey's Mary Elizabeth Winstead          Season 2 - 4-3 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 Season 2 takes place between 4BBY and 3BBY, and there are some fun things that tie Rebels into the rest of the galaxy's happenings at this time. In 4BBY, Han Solo acquires the famous Millennium Falcon through gambling and rescued Han Solo from Boba Fett. Leia Organa has her \"Day of Demand\" -- basically a fancy coronation -- in 3BBY when she turns 16 and claims her right to the throne of Alderaan. Becoming a junior legislator in the Imperial Senate in this year, she also becomes more active as a rebel when she learns that both her adoptive parents are part of the rebellion. RELATED: Andor Star Offers Vague Details About Her 'Practical' Star Wars Character          Season 3 - 2 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 In Season 3, it is revealed that Obi-Wan Kenobi survived Order 66, Darth Maul dies (cementing his status as the most tragic Sith) and the rebels receive official organization from Senator Mon Mothma, becoming the unified Rebel Alliance instead of different rebel cells. The Mandalorian Civil War also began in this year, as Sabine Wren acquires the Darksaber, which sets in motion events that will culminate in the Great Purge of Mandalore. That event, of course, is thoroughly discussed in The Mandalorian, which gives Rebels a connection to that series and The Book of Boba Fett.  RELATED: Star Wars: Ahsoka's Working Title Has Lord of the Rings Ties          Season Four - 1BBY to 0BBY                 Season 4 is largely set around 1BBY, which contains the aforementioned Great Purge of Mandalore and Bo-Katan Kryze's loss of the Darksaber to Moff Gideon -- an event also explored in The Mandalorian. This season also occurs alongside the events of Rogue One, in which Erso and Cassian Andor sacrifice themselves to provide invaluable knowledge of the Death Star that ultimately save the rebellion. The plans of the Death Star are successfully stolen and passed on to Leia Organa, catching Rebels up to the opening of Episode IV.   RELATED: How Ahsoka Is Setting Up a Star Wars Rebels Sequel          Season 4 Finale Prologue - 5 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 Season 4's finale -- also the series finale -- has a heartbreaking prologue to recap the events of Rebels thus far. It flashes back to 5BBY, when Darth Vader gave the command to hunt down and kill and Force-presenting children, as well as any surviving Jedi who might train them. Ahsoka Tano recounts the Anakin Skywalker that she knew to Ezra Bridger, as she is tormented by Anakin's voice taunting her about her decision to leave him, and the Jedi Order, behind. Star Wars Rebels canon might be somewhat convoluted, but it connects to several greater events in the Star Wars galaxy. That's one of the many reasons the animated series remains beloved to fans. With the further expansion of the universe through the Disney+ shows, it's even more important to recognize the place Rebels holds in Star Wars history.

The most underrated Star Wars animated series is Star Wars Rebels; however, it can also be the most difficult to figure out. Star Wars has had a habit of jumping across the timeline with its various projects (and sometimes within them) and Rebels is no different. That makes it hard for viewers to pinpoint exactly when in canon the events of the series happen.  But Rebels is very important to Star Wars, and its importance will continue to grow with the arrival of the Ahsoka series. Not only is the show meant as a sequel to the wildly popular animated series The Clone Wars, it also fills the gap between Episode III and Episode IV, while holding on to fan-favorite characters from Clone Wars in the process. With that in mind, it's important to know what happened when, and here's the best possible estimation (with \"BBY\" standing for before the Battle of Yavin). RELATED: Jabba the Hutt Might Have Lived Longer Than Yoda - If It Weren't for Leia          Season 1 - 5-4 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 The first season occurs from around 5BBY to 4BBY, and only one event situates things in the greater Star Wars timeline, but it's a very important one. Jyn Erso (seen in Star Wars: Rogue One) is abandoned by Saw Gerrera around 5BBY, starting the arc that led her to aiding in destroying the Death Star. She sacrifices herself on Scarif to ensure the Death Star's collapse in the same year as the Battle of Yavin. RELATED: Star Wars' Ahsoka Series Adds Birds of Prey's Mary Elizabeth Winstead          Season 2 - 4-3 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 Season 2 takes place between 4BBY and 3BBY, and there are some fun things that tie Rebels into the rest of the galaxy's happenings at this time. In 4BBY, Han Solo acquires the famous Millennium Falcon through gambling and rescued Han Solo from Boba Fett. Leia Organa has her \"Day of Demand\" -- basically a fancy coronation -- in 3BBY when she turns 16 and claims her right to the throne of Alderaan. Becoming a junior legislator in the Imperial Senate in this year, she also becomes more active as a rebel when she learns that both her adoptive parents are part of the rebellion. RELATED: Andor Star Offers Vague Details About Her 'Practical' Star Wars Character          Season 3 - 2 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 In Season 3, it is revealed that Obi-Wan Kenobi survived Order 66, Darth Maul dies (cementing his status as the most tragic Sith) and the rebels receive official organization from Senator Mon Mothma, becoming the unified Rebel Alliance instead of different rebel cells. The Mandalorian Civil War also began in this year, as Sabine Wren acquires the Darksaber, which sets in motion events that will culminate in the Great Purge of Mandalore. That event, of course, is thoroughly discussed in The Mandalorian, which gives Rebels a connection to that series and The Book of Boba Fett.  RELATED: Star Wars: Ahsoka's Working Title Has Lord of the Rings Ties          Season Four - 1BBY to 0BBY                 Season 4 is largely set around 1BBY, which contains the aforementioned Great Purge of Mandalore and Bo-Katan Kryze's loss of the Darksaber to Moff Gideon -- an event also explored in The Mandalorian. This season also occurs alongside the events of Rogue One, in which Erso and Cassian Andor sacrifice themselves to provide invaluable knowledge of the Death Star that ultimately save the rebellion. The plans of the Death Star are successfully stolen and passed on to Leia Organa, catching Rebels up to the opening of Episode IV.   RELATED: How Ahsoka Is Setting Up a Star Wars Rebels Sequel          Season 4 Finale Prologue - 5 Years Before the Battle of Yavin                 Season 4's finale -- also the series finale -- has a heartbreaking prologue to recap the events of Rebels thus far. It flashes back to 5BBY, when Darth Vader gave the command to hunt down and kill and Force-presenting children, as well as any surviving Jedi who might train them. Ahsoka Tano recounts the Anakin Skywalker that she knew to Ezra Bridger, as she is tormented by Anakin's voice taunting her about her decision to leave him, and the Jedi Order, behind. Star Wars Rebels canon might be somewhat convoluted, but it connects to several greater events in the Star Wars galaxy. That's one of the many reasons the animated series remains beloved to fans. With the further expansion of the universe through the Disney+ shows, it's even more important to recognize the place Rebels holds in Star Wars history.

By Jessie Xu Published 21 minutes ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Enmu has been a mysterious character in Demon Slayer from the start, but one topic has been hotly debated: the demon's gender.                 The most powerful demons in Demon Slayer are called the Twelve Kizuki (Demon Moons), who are further divided into six Upper Ranks and six Lower Ranks. The Lower Ranks were later all slaughtered by Muzan in disdain of their weakness, with the exception of one: Enmu.  Enmu is the Lower Rank One demon, and the primary antagonist in the Mugen Train Arc, who appears as a young man of average height with shoulder-length black hair tinged with pink, and blue eyes that have the kanji for \"Lower One\" etched into the irises. These neutral features, as well as a slow, drawling voice, can make Enmu's gender seem ambiguous. RELATED: Who Is Upper-Rank One in Demon Slayer?                Despite that, Enmu is, in fact, male -- and one with sadistic tendencies. He is one of the few demons throughout Demon Slayer that appears totally irredeemable, because he enjoys watching the suffering of humans.  His utter devotion to Muzan was also what saved Enmu when faced with impending death. While the rest of the Lower Moons begged for their lives, or tried to save themselves from slaughter, Enmu faced Muzan with an expression of reverence. That deviation was outside of Muzan\u2019s expectations. As a character who enjoys feeling superior, Muzan spared Enmu, and instead gave him more blood -- and another opportunity to prove himself. Enmu took that opportunity, and his newfound power, to hatch a nefarious plot. He merged with the Mugen Train, intending to take its passengers as his victims. Most of Enmu\u2019s skills center around his ability to manipulate dreams and reality. He can put people to sleep in his dream realm and show them beautiful, idealistic visions, or present them with the most heart-wrenching nightmares. It's that dynamic that challenges Tanjiro\u2019s fortitude throughout the Mugen Train Arc.  RELATED: Why Does Muzan Hate Doma of the Twelve Kizuki in Demon Slayer?                When Tanjiro and his companions boarded the train to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances, Enmu dragged them into a dream realm with the intent of killing them in their sleep. However, he cruelly borrowed the hands of four vulnerable children with terminal illnesses to perform that deed, luring them with the promise of an eternity of happy dreams. Tanjiro found himself in a world of peace where his family is alive and well, a reality he had long wished for, but one that he cannot regain. Despite how easy it would have been to simply lose himself in this false but idealistic world, with the assistance of Nezuko, Tanjiro forced himself back to reality.  That is the true cruelty of Enmu. He takes advantage of people\u2019s deepest desires and regrets, and turns it against them. His utter devotion to Muzan, as well as his genuine enjoyment of human suffering, separates him from other demons.                  Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family?

Spy x Family is probably the most hyped-up new show of anime's spring season. It might even be the most anticipated anime debut of 2022. Not only is it an adaptation of one of the most critically acclaimed manga of the last decade, but the anime is also being produced by Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song) and CloverWorks (My Dress-Up Darling, Wonder Egg Priority) -- two of the highest-profile animation studios in Japan. It's an understatement to say that the Spy x Family anime is premiering to extremely high expectations. Thankfully, the first episode of the anime lives up to those lofty expectations and may be one of the rare adaptations that manage to improve its source material.  The first episode of the show introduces viewers to the world-renowned super spy who is only known by his code name, Twilight. After deftly defusing an attempt to smear a powerful politician in the show's intro, Twilight is assigned his most challenging mission ever. This mission requires him to pretend to be an average family man to get close to his next target, a dangerous political leader who only appears in public to attend events held by the prestigious private academy his son attends. In order to infiltrate the school, Twilight takes on the alias \"Loid Forger\" and adopts a seemingly normal little girl, Anya. Unfortunately for him, his daughter has a secret of her own: she is an escaped experiment with psychic powers, which she immediately uses to discover her new father's double identity.  RELATED: Spy X Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime The new show manages to perfectly translate the humor from Tatsuya Endo's original manga. From the absurdity of the toupee-based conspiracy in the intro to Anya's reactions whenever she reads her father's purely espionage-focused thoughts, the first episode is loaded with multiple laugh-out-loud moments. There are even a few gags that are improved in the anime, such as the scene where Anya attempts to stealthily follow her super-spy father out of the house. The comedy is also improved thanks to excellent voice acting from Haikyuu's Takuya Eguchi, who perfectly captures Loid's world-weary yet empathetic personality with his performance. Atsumi Tanezaki, who previously starred in Mob Psycho 100, is also perfectly cast as Anya, whom she manages to portray as being adorably naive without being cloying.  Another aspect of the show that is improved with animation is the series' brief action scenes, which are animated with all the smoothness and impact you'd expect from both Wit Studio and CloverWorks. While the animation doesn't quite match the best moments from Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song's chaotic battles or the loving attention to detail that was displayed in My Dress-Up Darling, it's still a great-looking show in its own right. Action isn't the focus of the series, but the first episode makes it clear that the team behind the show is more than capable of choreographing and animating an exciting, impactful brawl for the scenes that require Loid to get his hands dirty.  RELATED: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary With that said, the anime wouldn't live up to the award-winning manga if Spy x Family didn't also manage to translate the original work's tangible feelings of warmth and familial tenderness. Thankfully, those key elements of the series appear to have been ported over fully intact. Even within its first episode, it's hard to not feel something when Loid and Anya celebrate their first victories together and show the first hints of a true father-daughter bond. These moments were the most memorable parts of Endo's manga, and they're also the best parts of the anime's premiere episode. In less than half an hour, the show manages to give you an idea of who Loid and Anya really are, and makes you want to see the dysfunctional family succeed.  Judged only on its spot-on comedy and action, Spy x Family would already be in the running for the best series of the last decade, but the series' more heartfelt moments elevate it to potentially being one of the best anime and manga series of all time. If the rest of the season can keep up the level of quality displayed in the first episode, then anime fans are truly in for something special. Spy x Family is being simulcast on Crunchyroll. The original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Spy x Family is probably the most hyped-up new show of anime's spring season. It might even be the most anticipated anime debut of 2022. Not only is it an adaptation of one of the most critically acclaimed manga of the last decade, but the anime is also being produced by Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song) and CloverWorks (My Dress-Up Darling, Wonder Egg Priority) -- two of the highest-profile animation studios in Japan. It's an understatement to say that the Spy x Family anime is premiering to extremely high expectations. Thankfully, the first episode of the anime lives up to those lofty expectations and may be one of the rare adaptations that manage to improve its source material.  The first episode of the show introduces viewers to the world-renowned super spy who is only known by his code name, Twilight. After deftly defusing an attempt to smear a powerful politician in the show's intro, Twilight is assigned his most challenging mission ever. This mission requires him to pretend to be an average family man to get close to his next target, a dangerous political leader who only appears in public to attend events held by the prestigious private academy his son attends. In order to infiltrate the school, Twilight takes on the alias \"Loid Forger\" and adopts a seemingly normal little girl, Anya. Unfortunately for him, his daughter has a secret of her own: she is an escaped experiment with psychic powers, which she immediately uses to discover her new father's double identity.  RELATED: Spy X Family Is Japan's Most Anticipated New Anime The new show manages to perfectly translate the humor from Tatsuya Endo's original manga. From the absurdity of the toupee-based conspiracy in the intro to Anya's reactions whenever she reads her father's purely espionage-focused thoughts, the first episode is loaded with multiple laugh-out-loud moments. There are even a few gags that are improved in the anime, such as the scene where Anya attempts to stealthily follow her super-spy father out of the house. The comedy is also improved thanks to excellent voice acting from Haikyuu's Takuya Eguchi, who perfectly captures Loid's world-weary yet empathetic personality with his performance. Atsumi Tanezaki, who previously starred in Mob Psycho 100, is also perfectly cast as Anya, whom she manages to portray as being adorably naive without being cloying.  Another aspect of the show that is improved with animation is the series' brief action scenes, which are animated with all the smoothness and impact you'd expect from both Wit Studio and CloverWorks. While the animation doesn't quite match the best moments from Vivy: Fluorite Eyes' Song's chaotic battles or the loving attention to detail that was displayed in My Dress-Up Darling, it's still a great-looking show in its own right. Action isn't the focus of the series, but the first episode makes it clear that the team behind the show is more than capable of choreographing and animating an exciting, impactful brawl for the scenes that require Loid to get his hands dirty.  RELATED: Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary With that said, the anime wouldn't live up to the award-winning manga if Spy x Family didn't also manage to translate the original work's tangible feelings of warmth and familial tenderness. Thankfully, those key elements of the series appear to have been ported over fully intact. Even within its first episode, it's hard to not feel something when Loid and Anya celebrate their first victories together and show the first hints of a true father-daughter bond. These moments were the most memorable parts of Endo's manga, and they're also the best parts of the anime's premiere episode. In less than half an hour, the show manages to give you an idea of who Loid and Anya really are, and makes you want to see the dysfunctional family succeed.  Judged only on its spot-on comedy and action, Spy x Family would already be in the running for the best series of the last decade, but the series' more heartfelt moments elevate it to potentially being one of the best anime and manga series of all time. If the rest of the season can keep up the level of quality displayed in the first episode, then anime fans are truly in for something special. Spy x Family is being simulcast on Crunchyroll. The original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness actor Elizabeth Olsen revealed that she finds Wanda Maximoff a more interesting character to portray than some other Marvel superheroes, thanks to her moral ambiguity.  As reported by The Direct, Olsen shared at the official press release for the upcoming Doctor Strange film that she has really enjoyed playing a morally gray hero. \"It\u2019s not the most fun, in my mind, to always play the hero of a story where they do no wrong,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t find that interesting. I think the reason why I really enjoyed Wanda from the beginning is that she\u2019s very clear in her beliefs. They just don\u2019t align with others, and that\u2019s okay. She'll have her own realizations and admit when she makes mistakes.\" RELATED: Marvel Edits Doctor Strange 2 International Poster Over 'Offensive' Hand Gesture  Olsen is likely referring to the events of last year's Disney+ series, WandaVision, where Wanda took over the entire town of Westview with her magic in order to live out her fantasy of a life with fellow Avenger Vision, who had been killed by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. While the series ended with the newly named \"Scarlet Witch\" freeing the residents of Westview from her spell, the final shot of the series showed Wanda attempting to master the Darkhold, a book of dark magic, presumably to try and bring her family back. Wanda is not the only Avenger who will be on a journey of self-discovery, however. Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Doctor Strange, also stated that his character will confront versions of himself across the multiverse and learn more about himself in the process. \"Strange sees, through his experience in the Multiverse and the various versions of him in the Multiverse, how much of a pattern of behavior he carries,\" Cumberbatch explained. \"It\u2019s a kind of imprint, an identification of who Doctor Stephen Strange is in any universe and what the dangers of that character are. Is he going to be the hero to his enemy or the enemy to his hero? Who is our Doctor Strange in the Multiverse? He\u2019s literally coming up against versions of himself to figure that out.\"  RELATED: America Chavez Co-Creator Slams Marvel's 'Insulting' Doctor Strange 2 Offer Directed by Sam Raimi, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness takes place a few months after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, with Dr. Stephen Strange and his team venturing into the multiverse to face a new enemy who threatens to tear the fabric of their world wide open. Alongside Cumberbatch and Olsen, the film also features Benedict Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg and Rachel McAdams. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is set to be released in theaters on May 6.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness actor Elizabeth Olsen revealed that she finds Wanda Maximoff a more interesting character to portray than some other Marvel superheroes, thanks to her moral ambiguity.  As reported by The Direct, Olsen shared at the official press release for the upcoming Doctor Strange film that she has really enjoyed playing a morally gray hero. \"It\u2019s not the most fun, in my mind, to always play the hero of a story where they do no wrong,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t find that interesting. I think the reason why I really enjoyed Wanda from the beginning is that she\u2019s very clear in her beliefs. They just don\u2019t align with others, and that\u2019s okay. She'll have her own realizations and admit when she makes mistakes.\" RELATED: Marvel Edits Doctor Strange 2 International Poster Over 'Offensive' Hand Gesture  Olsen is likely referring to the events of last year's Disney+ series, WandaVision, where Wanda took over the entire town of Westview with her magic in order to live out her fantasy of a life with fellow Avenger Vision, who had been killed by Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. While the series ended with the newly named \"Scarlet Witch\" freeing the residents of Westview from her spell, the final shot of the series showed Wanda attempting to master the Darkhold, a book of dark magic, presumably to try and bring her family back. Wanda is not the only Avenger who will be on a journey of self-discovery, however. Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Doctor Strange, also stated that his character will confront versions of himself across the multiverse and learn more about himself in the process. \"Strange sees, through his experience in the Multiverse and the various versions of him in the Multiverse, how much of a pattern of behavior he carries,\" Cumberbatch explained. \"It\u2019s a kind of imprint, an identification of who Doctor Stephen Strange is in any universe and what the dangers of that character are. Is he going to be the hero to his enemy or the enemy to his hero? Who is our Doctor Strange in the Multiverse? He\u2019s literally coming up against versions of himself to figure that out.\"  RELATED: America Chavez Co-Creator Slams Marvel's 'Insulting' Doctor Strange 2 Offer Directed by Sam Raimi, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness takes place a few months after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home, with Dr. Stephen Strange and his team venturing into the multiverse to face a new enemy who threatens to tear the fabric of their world wide open. Alongside Cumberbatch and Olsen, the film also features Benedict Wong, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg and Rachel McAdams. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is set to be released in theaters on May 6.

Musical icon Lady Gaga received an anime makeover thanks to a new partnership with Crunchyroll.  According to an official press release, pre-orders for the special Crunchyroll Loves x Lady Gaga streetwear collection will be available through April 21, exclusively through the streaming service's online store. Featuring imagery inspired by the singer's sixth studio album, Chromatica, and artwork from McFlyy, the collection has a total of eight pieces, including multiple t-shirts and hoodies, a pair of back fleece joggers, a bucket hat and a beanie. The Born This Way Foundation, Lady Gaga's non-profit that focuses on improving mental health and making the world a happier place, will receive a portion of the total proceeds.

It went on to win multiple awards, including Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Rain on Me\" at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and Western Album of the Year at the Japan Gold Disc Awards in 2021. The Crunchyroll Loves x Lady Gaga collection isn't the only new thing that can be found on the streaming service's website; several new anime series are currently making their premieres as part of the spring 2022 lineup. This includes Spy x Family, Love After World Domination, Skeleton Knight in Another World and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn by a Typical Nobody.  RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Teams Up With Uniqlo for New Graphic Tee Collection Multiple fan-favorite shows are making their return on Crunchyroll as well. Most notably, the second season of the iconic isekai anime, The Rising of the Shield Hero, is finally airing after the first season ended back in 2019. Crunchyroll is also streaming new seasons of Ascendance of a Bookworm and Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story. The anime streaming giant recently removed over fifty titles from its catalog. The removal included both popular series, like Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?, Food Wars: Shogeki No Shoma, Akame ga Kill! and No Game No Life, as well as more obscure shows, like Sunday Without God, The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, Is The Order a Rabbit?, Infinite Stratos and Familiar of Zero F. While no official explanation for the animes' removal was provided by Crunchyroll, it is noteworthy that the majority of the titles are licensed by Sentai Filmworks, which owns the competing anime streaming service, HIDIVE.

Unfortunately, some characters won't ever get a rematch.                  Akira Toriyama\u2019s Dragon Ball has achieved legendary status that\u2019s kept it at the forefront of the anime industry for nearly four decades. Dragon Ball chronicles the heroic adventures of Goku and his courageous friends who tirelessly fight to protect the planet from danger. There\u2019s a huge cast, incredible energy techniques, and powerful transformations that keep Dragon Ball fresh, but the series always knows when to expand its boundaries and head into new territory.  RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Fights That Dragged On Too Long The thrilling battles that punctuate Dragon Ball\u2019s climaxes are one of the most celebrated aspects of the series. Characters occasionally get multiple opportunities to prove themselves and work out their aggression, but the opposite is also true. There are some Dragon Ball rematches that would function as major events, but are likely lost causes at this point.  10          Another Fight Between Saiyan Siblings, Goku And Raditz, Isn\u2019t Happening                The bulk of Dragon Ball\u2019s villains have found ways to weasel back into the picture and get another chance at success. However, some of Dragon Ball\u2019s most interesting foes are the fleeting ones that appear at the start of the series. Dragon Ball Z\u2019s first real fight pushes Goku and Piccolo to work together as they take on invading alien, Raditz. Raditz sufficiently showcases Saiyan strength, but the battle is especially emotional since the enemy is Goku\u2019s estranged brother. There\u2019s so much potential in the idea of a rematch between these Saiyan siblings, but this window has likely closed.  9          Bardock Won\u2019t Get A Second Chance To Show His Winning Strategy Over Gas                There are certain rematches between Dragon Ball juggernauts that audiences have been waiting to see for hundreds of episodes, but there are also feuds that are considerably more recent. Gas is Dragon Ball Super\u2019s latest antagonist and the dangerous member of the Heeter Force actually has a curious history with Bardock, Goku\u2019s father. Goku currently struggles to conquer Gas\u2019 power, but it\u2019s something that Bardock was somehow able to accomplish. Bardock\u2019s deceased status makes it highly unlikely that he\u2019ll show up to take out Gas and save the day for Goku.  8          Vegeta And Nappa\u2019s Lengthy History Remains In The Past                Vegeta first appears in Dragon Ball Z as a serious threat to Earth\u2019s future, and it doesn\u2019t take long for a fiery rivalry to form between him and Goku. Vegeta and Goku grow into an iconic Saiyan team, but for years Vegeta engaged in destruction with his partner, Nappa. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Short Fights That Needed To Be Longer Nappa devastates Earth\u2019s weaker heroes, but he\u2019s no match for Goku, which causes Vegeta to cut his losses with the dead weight. Nappa, like Raditz, has mostly remained deceased. An extremely brief reunion between Vegeta and Nappa occurs during Dragon Ball GT\u2019s jailbreak from hell, but it\u2019s unlikely a more substantial rematch ever occurs.  7          An Older Gotenks And Lean Buu Deserve To Duel                Self-improvement isn\u2019t always enough in Dragon Ball, which is where the collaborative process of fusion comes into play. Fusion allows two individuals to combine their strength and abilities into one powerful package. A lot of stock is put on fused fighter, Gotenks, and how he might be strong enough to defeat Buu in his Super Saiyan 3 state. Gotenks isn\u2019t successful, but a helpful version of Buu joins the heroes after the fact. Dragon Ball Super hasn\u2019t done much with Buu, but he briefly gets in shape during his preparation for the Tournament of Power. A new clash of powers between these two would have been a delight.  6          Cabba And Vegeta\u2019s Moment For Collaboration Has Passed                The appearance of a new Saiyan is always reason for celebration in Dragon Ball, but Super goes above and beyond in this regard. Universe 6 and 7 are frequently pitted against each other in competition, which allows Goku and the rest of the universe\u2019s Saiyans to get close with Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale. Cabba exhibits a lot of reverence towards Vegeta\u2019s regal status and is just as interested in training under him as he is in sparring against him. Dragon Ball Super sets up some one-on-one time between these two, but it\u2019s been so long without this promise getting fulfilled that the moment has likely passed.  5          Goku And Pikkon Are The Pride Of The North Quadrant\u2019s Fallen Fighters                A debate rages on between Dragon Ball purists and those who want more incorporation from the anime\u2019s filler material. Pikkon is one of the more popular anime-only characters. The deceased fighter first crosses paths with Goku in the Other World Tournament, where he proves himself as the Super Saiyan\u2019s equal. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 7 Classic Fights That Would Have Been Better With Ki Impressively, Pikkon also plays an important role in the film Fusion Reborn and is a common participant in video games. Many hoped that recruitment for the Tournament of Power would result in an invitation extended out to Pikkon, but Super\u2019s decision to ignore the individual is probably a confirmation that a rematch isn\u2019t happening.  4          Piccolo Won\u2019t Get To Show His Improvement In Another Battle Against Universe 6\u2019s Frost                Piccolo experiences a significant power upgrade on Planet Namek when he fuses with Nail and proves himself against Frieza\u2019s second form. A full-on rematch between Piccolo and Frieza would be incredible after how much they\u2019ve grown, but it\u2019s something that might actually happen with Frieza\u2019s reintegration into the story. Alternatively, Universe 6\u2019s Frieza counterpart, Frost, faces against Piccolo during Universe 7\u2019s tournament against Champa\u2019s best fighters. Frost is fascinating when his intentions are a mystery, but he recedes into the background after he\u2019s exposed as a lesser version of Frieza.  3          A Super Saiyan 4 Showdown Against Anyone Is Extremely Unlikely                Contrary to popular opinion, Dragon Ball GT isn\u2019t a dumpster fire anime sequel. Dragon Ball GT takes some time to find its footing, but it explores some genuinely creative ideas, which unfortunately have largely been undone through the events of Dragon Ball Super. One of Dragon Ball GT\u2019s longest lasting legacies is its unique Super Saiyan 4 transformation. Dragon Ball Super opts for Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue instead of the GT counterpart, which means that it\u2019s unlikely that there will be a legitimate rematch between any Super Saiyan 4 with anyone (other than in video games and the promotional series, Super Dragon Ball Heroes).  2          Audiences Have Waited Decades For A Gohan And Cell Reunion                Goku usually steals the spotlight when it comes to the elimination of Dragon Ball\u2019s biggest opponents, which is exactly why Gohan\u2019s Super Saiyan 2 debut and subsequent destruction of Cell remains a high point for the series. Gohan has only grown more powerful since his fight against Cell, and it\u2019d make sense if the same was also true for his opponent. There are rumors that Cell makes his grand return in the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, which is the perfect opportunity for a rematch against a grown-up Gohan. This remains wishful thinking and Dragon Ball fans have gotten used to the idea that Cell\u2019s a permanent casualty.  1          Goku And Jiren\u2019s Clash Is The Tournament Of Power\u2019s Apex                Villains of unprecedented power show up in Dragon Ball Super, but the multiversal battle royale competition, the Tournament of Power, becomes the anime\u2019s ultimate test. The strongest warriors from across the multiverse compete in the face of the universes\u2019 potential erasure. Goku and Universe 7 hold their own, but Universe 11\u2019s Jiren quickly proves himself to be Goku\u2019s toughest competition. Jiren\u2019s perseverance and strength pushes Goku to dip into Ultra Instinct power for the first time, which is a milestone for the franchise. Jiren is still alive and he and Goku aren\u2019t on poor terms, but it seems as if Dragon Ball considers Jiren to be in its past.

Universe 6 and 7 are frequently pitted against each other in competition, which allows Goku and the rest of the universe\u2019s Saiyans to get close with Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale. Cabba exhibits a lot of reverence towards Vegeta\u2019s regal status and is just as interested in training under him as he is in sparring against him. Dragon Ball Super sets up some one-on-one time between these two, but it\u2019s been so long without this promise getting fulfilled that the moment has likely passed.  5          Goku And Pikkon Are The Pride Of The North Quadrant\u2019s Fallen Fighters                A debate rages on between Dragon Ball purists and those who want more incorporation from the anime\u2019s filler material. Pikkon is one of the more popular anime-only characters. The deceased fighter first crosses paths with Goku in the Other World Tournament, where he proves himself as the Super Saiyan\u2019s equal. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 7 Classic Fights That Would Have Been Better With Ki Impressively, Pikkon also plays an important role in the film Fusion Reborn and is a common participant in video games. Many hoped that recruitment for the Tournament of Power would result in an invitation extended out to Pikkon, but Super\u2019s decision to ignore the individual is probably a confirmation that a rematch isn\u2019t happening.  4          Piccolo Won\u2019t Get To Show His Improvement In Another Battle Against Universe 6\u2019s Frost                Piccolo experiences a significant power upgrade on Planet Namek when he fuses with Nail and proves himself against Frieza\u2019s second form. A full-on rematch between Piccolo and Frieza would be incredible after how much they\u2019ve grown, but it\u2019s something that might actually happen with Frieza\u2019s reintegration into the story. Alternatively, Universe 6\u2019s Frieza counterpart, Frost, faces against Piccolo during Universe 7\u2019s tournament against Champa\u2019s best fighters. Frost is fascinating when his intentions are a mystery, but he recedes into the background after he\u2019s exposed as a lesser version of Frieza.  3          A Super Saiyan 4 Showdown Against Anyone Is Extremely Unlikely                Contrary to popular opinion, Dragon Ball GT isn\u2019t a dumpster fire anime sequel. Dragon Ball GT takes some time to find its footing, but it explores some genuinely creative ideas, which unfortunately have largely been undone through the events of Dragon Ball Super. One of Dragon Ball GT\u2019s longest lasting legacies is its unique Super Saiyan 4 transformation. Dragon Ball Super opts for Super Saiyan God and Super Saiyan Blue instead of the GT counterpart, which means that it\u2019s unlikely that there will be a legitimate rematch between any Super Saiyan 4 with anyone (other than in video games and the promotional series, Super Dragon Ball Heroes).  2          Audiences Have Waited Decades For A Gohan And Cell Reunion                Goku usually steals the spotlight when it comes to the elimination of Dragon Ball\u2019s biggest opponents, which is exactly why Gohan\u2019s Super Saiyan 2 debut and subsequent destruction of Cell remains a high point for the series. Gohan has only grown more powerful since his fight against Cell, and it\u2019d make sense if the same was also true for his opponent. There are rumors that Cell makes his grand return in the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, which is the perfect opportunity for a rematch against a grown-up Gohan. This remains wishful thinking and Dragon Ball fans have gotten used to the idea that Cell\u2019s a permanent casualty.  1          Goku And Jiren\u2019s Clash Is The Tournament Of Power\u2019s Apex                Villains of unprecedented power show up in Dragon Ball Super, but the multiversal battle royale competition, the Tournament of Power, becomes the anime\u2019s ultimate test. The strongest warriors from across the multiverse compete in the face of the universes\u2019 potential erasure. Goku and Universe 7 hold their own, but Universe 11\u2019s Jiren quickly proves himself to be Goku\u2019s toughest competition. Jiren\u2019s perseverance and strength pushes Goku to dip into Ultra Instinct power for the first time, which is a milestone for the franchise. Jiren is still alive and he and Goku aren\u2019t on poor terms, but it seems as if Dragon Ball considers Jiren to be in its past.

The following contains spoilers for Spy x Family Chapter 62.1 by Tatsuya Endo, Casey Loe and Rina Mapa, available in English now via Viz Media.   In Spy x Family, not much is known about Twilight's past despite the readers having been with him on his family shenanigans and his missions. The only few details that have been revealed are that he abandoned his old life in favor of the life of a spy. Having lost his parents in the war, Twilight's motivation to maintain peace between Westalis and Ostania is so there will not be any other orphans like him. He wanted to create a world where children wouldn't have to cry.  Even though Twilight has no experience being a parent, he is undoubtedly a good father. While he is adamant that the Forger family is nothing but a facade, he nonetheless would be willing to put himself in danger to protect Anya, Yor and Bond. This week's chapter of Spy x Family dives into Twilight's past -- before he was Twilight -- and the events that made him the man he is. RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                 If there was any hope that readers would get to know Twilight's real name since this chapter focused on his childhood, those hopes were quickly dashed; the chapter cheekily blacked out his name. As a boy, Twilight spent most of his days playing war with his friends in an abandoned depot. He and his friends quickly become infatuated with the idea of being soldiers. At home, however, Twilight immediately hides his toy gun from his father.  Twilight's father is an interesting and rather contradictory character. Upon seeing how eager his son is to go to war to find \"those awful monsters from the East,\" he immediately slaps him. It's not clear if this is a common recurrence, but the fact that his father's first instinct was to hit his son is already concerning. What's more, Twilight's childhood seems to be marred with instances of fights between his mother and father. While the slap is unjustified and should never have been done, his father's anger is understandable. All the sentiments around the Ostanians being \"monsters\" are propaganda fed by those in Westalis. Instead of hoping for war, Twilight's father says to his son that he should hope for peace.  That's exactly what adult Twilight's mission is -- to maintain peace between Ostania and Westalis so that war doesn't break out. His father's words left a strong enough impact for him to carry that through to his adult life. And although Twilight's father insisted that violence would never achieve peace, Twilight's line of work does demand a certain level of violence in order to protect the powerless. It's not specified, but Twilight's father's job appears to be diplomatic in nature, and he may have worked in a department that maintained peace at the border.  RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Anya Is the Best Girl of the Series                 Knowing who Twilight is now and his occupation, it's endearing to see what he was like when he was a child. Adult Twilight can lie with ease and disguise himself flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Twilight as a boy feels absolutely guilty when he has to lie to his father for pocket money to buy the soldier set. Even after getting the gun, he can't go through with playing with it and returns home. After talking to the croquette lady and realizing that the Ostanians may not be as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Twilight wants to return home and apologize to his father.  Sadly, Twilight doesn't get a chance to do that. A bomb crashes into the town of Luwen, destroying the depot that Twilight's friends were playing in just a few hours ago, leaving nothing but the \"KEEP OUT\" sign lying in the rubble. The chapter doesn't confirm whether or not Twilight's friends managed to escape before they were killed, but it doesn't look optimistic. Despite having never been a father before, it's made abundantly clear that Twilight's parenting style was influenced by his own father. He would never raise a hand to Anya, and his parenting is usually much more gentle and gives off heartwarming vibes. This is a Twilight who never wants to inflict the same pain on his child (even if Anya is his fake daughter) that he endured when he was young.  It's hard to remember that Spy x Family is set during a time when war could erupt at any moment. All of the comedic moments are what make Spy x Family so enjoyable, but moments like these with Twilight's backstory make readers realize that this is what makes the manga so special.

This week's chapter of Spy x Family dives into Twilight's past -- before he was Twilight -- and the events that made him the man he is. RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good                 If there was any hope that readers would get to know Twilight's real name since this chapter focused on his childhood, those hopes were quickly dashed; the chapter cheekily blacked out his name. As a boy, Twilight spent most of his days playing war with his friends in an abandoned depot. He and his friends quickly become infatuated with the idea of being soldiers. At home, however, Twilight immediately hides his toy gun from his father.  Twilight's father is an interesting and rather contradictory character. Upon seeing how eager his son is to go to war to find \"those awful monsters from the East,\" he immediately slaps him. It's not clear if this is a common recurrence, but the fact that his father's first instinct was to hit his son is already concerning. What's more, Twilight's childhood seems to be marred with instances of fights between his mother and father. While the slap is unjustified and should never have been done, his father's anger is understandable. All the sentiments around the Ostanians being \"monsters\" are propaganda fed by those in Westalis. Instead of hoping for war, Twilight's father says to his son that he should hope for peace.  That's exactly what adult Twilight's mission is -- to maintain peace between Ostania and Westalis so that war doesn't break out. His father's words left a strong enough impact for him to carry that through to his adult life. And although Twilight's father insisted that violence would never achieve peace, Twilight's line of work does demand a certain level of violence in order to protect the powerless. It's not specified, but Twilight's father's job appears to be diplomatic in nature, and he may have worked in a department that maintained peace at the border.  RELATED: Why Spy x Family's Anya Is the Best Girl of the Series                 Knowing who Twilight is now and his occupation, it's endearing to see what he was like when he was a child. Adult Twilight can lie with ease and disguise himself flawlessly in the blink of an eye. Twilight as a boy feels absolutely guilty when he has to lie to his father for pocket money to buy the soldier set. Even after getting the gun, he can't go through with playing with it and returns home. After talking to the croquette lady and realizing that the Ostanians may not be as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Twilight wants to return home and apologize to his father.  Sadly, Twilight doesn't get a chance to do that. A bomb crashes into the town of Luwen, destroying the depot that Twilight's friends were playing in just a few hours ago, leaving nothing but the \"KEEP OUT\" sign lying in the rubble. The chapter doesn't confirm whether or not Twilight's friends managed to escape before they were killed, but it doesn't look optimistic. Despite having never been a father before, it's made abundantly clear that Twilight's parenting style was influenced by his own father. He would never raise a hand to Anya, and his parenting is usually much more gentle and gives off heartwarming vibes. This is a Twilight who never wants to inflict the same pain on his child (even if Anya is his fake daughter) that he endured when he was young.  It's hard to remember that Spy x Family is set during a time when war could erupt at any moment. All of the comedic moments are what make Spy x Family so enjoyable, but moments like these with Twilight's backstory make readers realize that this is what makes the manga so special.

By Hilary Leung Published 21 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Azuma faces off against Umezawa, but is he any match for the choujin?                  The following contains spoilers for Choujin X, Chapter 19 by Sui Ishida, Jan Cash and Snir Aharon, available in English from Viz Media and Manga Plus.   The horror elements really shine through in this week's chapter of Choujin X -- qualities that have made Ishida's artwork so iconic. After being rejected from tagging along on the rescue mission, Azuma takes matters into his own hands and sets off alone to save Tokio. Doubts had been floating around in the air regarding whether Azuma's intentions were genuine or not, but those doubts are resolved as his characterization becomes more fleshed out.  Ishida's artwork cannot be praised enough, especially in the fight scene between Azuma and Umezawa. It's striking and dynamic in a way that makes every kick and punch look that much harder. Azuma is a good fighter, but against a formidable opponent like Umezawa, what hope does he really have to win? RELATED: Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll                 The chapter opens with Azuma sitting gloomily in front of his shelf full of awards and trophies. Even though Azuma doesn't have the more obvious traits of a choujin like Tokio who can transform into a vulture-like creature, the chapter drops hints that there may have been changes to Azuma's body as a result of the injection, such as the wheelchair implying that Azuma might be weaker than before.  As a non-choujin, Azuma knows that there's truth to Sato's words; he wouldn't stand a chance against any of the choujin and would only slow the rescue crew down if he accompanied them. However, he remembers what his father told him: \"To shirk justice is cowardice.\" Azuma might be scared, but if he turned away from doing the right thing, not only would it be wrong but he would also be a coward. Back in Chapter 1, Azuma was the first to grab the syringe that contained the serum, and Tokio did the same because he wanted to remain friends with Azuma. Tokio risked his life to save Azuma. Now Azuma wants to do the same for Tokio.  He arrives at an abandoned motel where Umezawa awaits. Without wasting any time, Azuma swings a kick out at Umezawa, but she transforms into paper and slips out of his grasp. She warns him that if he continues on like this, he will die. Because Azuma is already quite good at fighting, he's able to land a few hits on Umezawa, with one of his kicks removing her mask. She uses her second ability called Paper Trip, which allows her to transform everything she touches into paper so that Azuma loses his footing. As soon as she finds an opening, Umezawa strikes, cutting off one of his ears as revenge for kicking her in the face.  RELATED: Which Anime to Watch After Finishing Tokyo Ghoul                 Umezawa is pretty perceptive. Even though Azuma seems adamant that all he wants to do is be a good friend, she accurately (or not) pinpoints that he's doing this to test himself in the hope that fighting a choujin might give him powers. This fight is part noble and part selfish in that regard. But she doesn't really care -- she's more angry that Azuma landed a kick on her, and she shows no mercy in retaliating. She truly gives a whole other meaning to the phrase 'Death by papercut' because by the end of it, Azuma is so severely wounded that it looks like he wouldn't be able to last more than a few more seconds.  Whenever Azuma isn't sure what to do, he remembers a time when his father took him to the railroad with two tracks diverging in two different directions. The tracks on the right lead to Yamato, but when Azuma asked his father where the ones on the left went, his father didn't answer. Instead, he led Azuma down the tracks, walking through the forest until they arrived at a blockade. The tracks on the left led to nowhere. Despite Azuma not knowing what the outcome of his choice in saving Tokio would be and that it would lead to a dead end, he still went to save him. The metaphor extends to Azuma's final moments just before Umezawa launches her final attack, when he remembers the two diverging railroad tracks in his childhood memory. Two paths, two choices. One path leads him to something that he's familiar with -- something safe -- while the other path leads only to a dead end. Just before Umezawa dismembers him, the lever switches, representing something being unlocked. It's possible that Azuma might have been unconsciously hindering himself from reaching his full potential as a choujin.  It will be difficult to wait for the next chapter of Choujin X to see what happened to Azuma. This is probably not the last time readers have seen him, but will they be witnessing the birth of a new choujin?

Choujin X: Has [SPOILER]'s Story Hit a Dead End?  By Hilary Leung Published 21 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Azuma faces off against Umezawa, but is he any match for the choujin?                  The following contains spoilers for Choujin X, Chapter 19 by Sui Ishida, Jan Cash and Snir Aharon, available in English from Viz Media and Manga Plus.   The horror elements really shine through in this week's chapter of Choujin X -- qualities that have made Ishida's artwork so iconic. After being rejected from tagging along on the rescue mission, Azuma takes matters into his own hands and sets off alone to save Tokio. Doubts had been floating around in the air regarding whether Azuma's intentions were genuine or not, but those doubts are resolved as his characterization becomes more fleshed out.  Ishida's artwork cannot be praised enough, especially in the fight scene between Azuma and Umezawa. It's striking and dynamic in a way that makes every kick and punch look that much harder. Azuma is a good fighter, but against a formidable opponent like Umezawa, what hope does he really have to win? RELATED: Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll                 The chapter opens with Azuma sitting gloomily in front of his shelf full of awards and trophies. Even though Azuma doesn't have the more obvious traits of a choujin like Tokio who can transform into a vulture-like creature, the chapter drops hints that there may have been changes to Azuma's body as a result of the injection, such as the wheelchair implying that Azuma might be weaker than before.  As a non-choujin, Azuma knows that there's truth to Sato's words; he wouldn't stand a chance against any of the choujin and would only slow the rescue crew down if he accompanied them. However, he remembers what his father told him: \"To shirk justice is cowardice.\" Azuma might be scared, but if he turned away from doing the right thing, not only would it be wrong but he would also be a coward. Back in Chapter 1, Azuma was the first to grab the syringe that contained the serum, and Tokio did the same because he wanted to remain friends with Azuma. Tokio risked his life to save Azuma. Now Azuma wants to do the same for Tokio.  He arrives at an abandoned motel where Umezawa awaits. Without wasting any time, Azuma swings a kick out at Umezawa, but she transforms into paper and slips out of his grasp. She warns him that if he continues on like this, he will die. Because Azuma is already quite good at fighting, he's able to land a few hits on Umezawa, with one of his kicks removing her mask. She uses her second ability called Paper Trip, which allows her to transform everything she touches into paper so that Azuma loses his footing. As soon as she finds an opening, Umezawa strikes, cutting off one of his ears as revenge for kicking her in the face.  RELATED: Which Anime to Watch After Finishing Tokyo Ghoul                 Umezawa is pretty perceptive. Even though Azuma seems adamant that all he wants to do is be a good friend, she accurately (or not) pinpoints that he's doing this to test himself in the hope that fighting a choujin might give him powers. This fight is part noble and part selfish in that regard. But she doesn't really care -- she's more angry that Azuma landed a kick on her, and she shows no mercy in retaliating. She truly gives a whole other meaning to the phrase 'Death by papercut' because by the end of it, Azuma is so severely wounded that it looks like he wouldn't be able to last more than a few more seconds.  Whenever Azuma isn't sure what to do, he remembers a time when his father took him to the railroad with two tracks diverging in two different directions. The tracks on the right lead to Yamato, but when Azuma asked his father where the ones on the left went, his father didn't answer. Instead, he led Azuma down the tracks, walking through the forest until they arrived at a blockade. The tracks on the left led to nowhere. Despite Azuma not knowing what the outcome of his choice in saving Tokio would be and that it would lead to a dead end, he still went to save him. The metaphor extends to Azuma's final moments just before Umezawa launches her final attack, when he remembers the two diverging railroad tracks in his childhood memory. Two paths, two choices. One path leads him to something that he's familiar with -- something safe -- while the other path leads only to a dead end. Just before Umezawa dismembers him, the lever switches, representing something being unlocked. It's possible that Azuma might have been unconsciously hindering himself from reaching his full potential as a choujin.  It will be difficult to wait for the next chapter of Choujin X to see what happened to Azuma. This is probably not the last time readers have seen him, but will they be witnessing the birth of a new choujin?
