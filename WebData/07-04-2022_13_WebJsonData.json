SoraNews24 is a Tokyo-based news site. In 2008, our sister site, RocketNews24 published its first Japanese-language article, and two years later came the start of our English site, which originally existed exclusively to translate articles from our Japanese colleagues. Over time we\u2019ve expanded the amount of English-language content we produce while maintaining a focus on fun, weird, and intriguing news from Asia, particularly Japan. Because of that, we decided to give the English-language RocketNews24 a very special eighth-birthday gift: the new name of SoraNews24.\u00a0Sora is the Japanese word for \u201csky,\u201d representing our commitment to bringing coverage of modern and traditional culture from Japan and Asia to people around the world, no matter which part of the sky we share that you happen to be living under. \u25a0SoraNews24 Japan Facts and Figures  News blog based in Tokyo, Japan, launched on Dec, 2008.
