Even though it's strong, it cannot be easily unleashed.                 WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Doron Dororon Chapter 17, \"Sword and Shield,\" by Gen Oosuka, Camellia Nieh and Phil Christie, available in English at Viz and Manga Plus.  Doron Dororon's beloved duo Dora and Kusanagi have\u00a0constantly\u00a0done their best to purge all the evil Mononoke\u00a0monsters. Since Kusanagi isn't necessarily an ally most humans will readily accept, they initially worked under the radar. However, their vigilante works were quickly put to a halt when they faced the accursed Hanya Gyuuki, and the esteemed Samurai learned of their existence and ability. After successfully appealing to the higher-ups, Dora and Kusanagi gained the right to operate as Samurai under Heisuke Ujii's guidance as he trained the\u00a0pair alongside his other subordinates. He was also partly responsible for Kusanagi's epiphany of enshrouding Dora with its supernatural energy. During their fight against the humanoid Mononoke, the duo unleashes the technique they've honed with Touma Toda. It's extremely powerful, but there's a\u00a0drawback as well.  RELATED:\u00a0Ranking of Kings' Biggest Questions After the Season 1 Finale                After saving Ichiha from Tameemon's hands, Yoshihime lured Ujii deeper into the Mononoke's trap\u00a0while\u00a0Dora, Kusanagi and Touma were left to deal with the drunkard Mononoke. The fight immediately became one-sided with Touma repeatedly receiving Tameemon's attacks. The humanoid Mononoke was quick on the uptake, noticing that the Samurai was holding back against him.

Even though it's strong, it cannot be easily unleashed.                 WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Doron Dororon Chapter 17, \"Sword and Shield,\" by Gen Oosuka, Camellia Nieh and Phil Christie, available in English at Viz and Manga Plus.  Doron Dororon's beloved duo Dora and Kusanagi have\u00a0constantly\u00a0done their best to purge all the evil Mononoke\u00a0monsters. Since Kusanagi isn't necessarily an ally most humans will readily accept, they initially worked under the radar. However, their vigilante works were quickly put to a halt when they faced the accursed Hanya Gyuuki, and the esteemed Samurai learned of their existence and ability. After successfully appealing to the higher-ups, Dora and Kusanagi gained the right to operate as Samurai under Heisuke Ujii's guidance as he trained the\u00a0pair alongside his other subordinates. He was also partly responsible for Kusanagi's epiphany of enshrouding Dora with its supernatural energy. During their fight against the humanoid Mononoke, the duo unleashes the technique they've honed with Touma Toda. It's extremely powerful, but there's a\u00a0drawback as well.  RELATED:\u00a0Ranking of Kings' Biggest Questions After the Season 1 Finale                After saving Ichiha from Tameemon's hands, Yoshihime lured Ujii deeper into the Mononoke's trap\u00a0while\u00a0Dora, Kusanagi and Touma were left to deal with the drunkard Mononoke. The fight immediately became one-sided with Touma repeatedly receiving Tameemon's attacks. The humanoid Mononoke was quick on the uptake, noticing that the Samurai was holding back against him. He revealed that the previous Samurai he'd faced were quick to launch an attack on him -- a revelation that initially angered Touma, but he managed to remain calm. Just then, a sudden burst of supernatural energy erupted from Dora and Kusanagi.  When Tameemon sensed the duo's power, he\u00a0aimed to\u00a0eliminate them quickly, drinking his booze and\u00a0undergoing a power-up. Seeing the Mononoke charging toward the duo, Touma put\u00a0himself between them and acted as a shield. He\u00a0successfully\u00a0dodged the first attack, but the air pressure still sent the Samurai flying. Even so, Touma regained his footing\u00a0but received another killer technique from Tameemon, which finally took him down. However,\u00a0the sacrifice\u00a0wasn't in vain; Dora and Kusanagi ultimately finished their preparation and cut the humanoid Mononoke with their first killing technique: Merged Humanoke Heaven-and-Earth Slash.  RELATED:\u00a0Doron Dororon Has Its Own Satoru Gojo - With a Funny Twist                The human-Mononoke pair's strongest attack yet in Doron Dororon is a result of them merging together. Kusanagi envelops Dora with its supernatural energy, which then allowed Dora to focus and utilize\u00a0that energy. The drawback, however, is that the merging happens in stages rather than a continuous manner. The duo must maintain their focus throughout the process, which leaves them vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately Touma volunteers to be their tank, which is exactly what he did during their fight against Tameemon. Dora and Kusanagi may have ultimately found a way around Dora's lack of supernatural ability, but their strongest attack is still far from being efficient. Although Touma is a very efficient tank, he won't be able to hold his ground against multiple enemies -- at least not with his current abilities. That being said,\u00a0the duo will\u00a0definitely\u00a0have to\u00a0find a way to hasten their merging if they want to be of more use in future battles in\u00a0Doron Dororon.

By Harry Alexander Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Grand Theft Auto's new subscription service is now in full swing, with April promising a wide variety of benefits to paid-up members.                 GTA+,\u00a0Rockstar's\u00a0new VIP subscription service\u00a0for Grand Theft Auto Online,\u00a0offers a\u00a0variety of benefits, exclusives, and bonuses to paying members. Launched on March 29 and available to anyone who already owns a copy of either Grand Theft Auto V or GTA Online,\u00a0the\u00a0service is currently only\u00a0available for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 players.  At $5.99 a month, the subscription comes with a plethora of bonuses that will vary on a month-by-month basis as the game is updated, including access to rare items, cars, weapons and upgrades, as well as special discounts, cash bonuses, and exclusive properties. Although these benefits vary monthly, players keep any items accessed or obtained via their subscription into the following months.\u00a0They will also retain any benefits\u00a0and\u00a0access to their bonus items even after they have canceled their subscription. RELATED:\u00a0The Best Cheats in Grand Theft Auto 5                  This month sees the usual $500,000 delivered into players' Maze Bank accounts, a quick fix for players who are\u00a0not yet accumulating huge capital via heists, as well as a host of bonuses designed to appeal to car-lovers across the sprawling cityscape of Los Santos. Subscribers will gain the Principe Deveste Eight hypercar\u00a0and the Hao's Special Works upgrade before the general player base, not to mention a free HSW Orange Trip and HSW CMYK Glitch Liveries. The La Mesa Auto Shop, meanwhile, offers updates from Los Santos Tuners, and current Auto Shop owners can relocate to La Mesa at no additional charge. Members will receive 3X GTA$ and RP on Hao\u2019s Special Works Race Series, as well as 2X Car Meet Rep on the Street Race Series.  Better yet for car buffs, any Los Santos Car Meet Membership fees will be waived during April. This means that LS Car Meet members with GTA+ will be reimbursed $50,000,\u00a0which benefits experienced players more than complete novices. Free paints and emblems will also be made available from the Auto Shop as part of this month's exclusive rewards. For motorists keen on getting the best for their vehicles, April seems like a good place to start subscribing. However, members who find their choice of car to be nothing more than a passing triviality may be put off by a very automotive-centric month. RELATED: How Free Guy Beat GTA to Its Own Movie                   Away from the roads themselves, yacht owners\u00a0can upgrade to the Aquarius Super Yacht at no additional cost, a more significant benefit for players who have already spent their time acquiring enough capital for yacht ownership in the first place. Players also gain the Conveyor Livery\u00a0for the Mammoth Avenger, the HVY APC, and the TM-02 Khanjali. Finally, style-conscious players will receive the Guss\u00e9t Frog Tee and Broker Prolaps Basketball Top and Shorts, though these items do feel a little less exclusive when shared with all other paid-up GTA+ members. There's no doubt that the cumulative value of the upgrades for April, and indeed for any month, is easily in excess of the $5.99 fee required to access GTA+. It's certainly worth noting that many of April's benefits are skewed toward more experienced, car-loving players who already have access to many of GTA Online's benefits and services -- though novices will still be able to use their massive cash injection however they see fit. The monthly benefit of $500,000 in currency is an evergreen bonus that makes commercial sense for those players who spend a lot of in-game currency and are keen for a little more bang for their buck.

Grand Theft Auto 5: Are GTA+'s April Benefits Worth the Price of Admission?  By Harry Alexander Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Grand Theft Auto's new subscription service is now in full swing, with April promising a wide variety of benefits to paid-up members.                 GTA+,\u00a0Rockstar's\u00a0new VIP subscription service\u00a0for Grand Theft Auto Online,\u00a0offers a\u00a0variety of benefits, exclusives, and bonuses to paying members. Launched on March 29 and available to anyone who already owns a copy of either Grand Theft Auto V or GTA Online,\u00a0the\u00a0service is currently only\u00a0available for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 players.  At $5.99 a month, the subscription comes with a plethora of bonuses that will vary on a month-by-month basis as the game is updated, including access to rare items, cars, weapons and upgrades, as well as special discounts, cash bonuses, and exclusive properties. Although these benefits vary monthly, players keep any items accessed or obtained via their subscription into the following months.\u00a0They will also retain any benefits\u00a0and\u00a0access to their bonus items even after they have canceled their subscription. RELATED:\u00a0The Best Cheats in Grand Theft Auto 5                  This month sees the usual $500,000 delivered into players' Maze Bank accounts, a quick fix for players who are\u00a0not yet accumulating huge capital via heists, as well as a host of bonuses designed to appeal to car-lovers across the sprawling cityscape of Los Santos. Subscribers will gain the Principe Deveste Eight hypercar\u00a0and the Hao's Special Works upgrade before the general player base, not to mention a free HSW Orange Trip and HSW CMYK Glitch Liveries. The La Mesa Auto Shop, meanwhile, offers updates from Los Santos Tuners, and current Auto Shop owners can relocate to La Mesa at no additional charge. Members will receive 3X GTA$ and RP on Hao\u2019s Special Works Race Series, as well as 2X Car Meet Rep on the Street Race Series.  Better yet for car buffs, any Los Santos Car Meet Membership fees will be waived during April. This means that LS Car Meet members with GTA+ will be reimbursed $50,000,\u00a0which benefits experienced players more than complete novices. Free paints and emblems will also be made available from the Auto Shop as part of this month's exclusive rewards. For motorists keen on getting the best for their vehicles, April seems like a good place to start subscribing. However, members who find their choice of car to be nothing more than a passing triviality may be put off by a very automotive-centric month. RELATED: How Free Guy Beat GTA to Its Own Movie                   Away from the roads themselves, yacht owners\u00a0can upgrade to the Aquarius Super Yacht at no additional cost, a more significant benefit for players who have already spent their time acquiring enough capital for yacht ownership in the first place. Players also gain the Conveyor Livery\u00a0for the Mammoth Avenger, the HVY APC, and the TM-02 Khanjali. Finally, style-conscious players will receive the Guss\u00e9t Frog Tee and Broker Prolaps Basketball Top and Shorts, though these items do feel a little less exclusive when shared with all other paid-up GTA+ members. There's no doubt that the cumulative value of the upgrades for April, and indeed for any month, is easily in excess of the $5.99 fee required to access GTA+. It's certainly worth noting that many of April's benefits are skewed toward more experienced, car-loving players who already have access to many of GTA Online's benefits and services -- though novices will still be able to use their massive cash injection however they see fit. The monthly benefit of $500,000 in currency is an evergreen bonus that makes commercial sense for those players who spend a lot of in-game currency and are keen for a little more bang for their buck.

Home Anime Sasaki and Miyano: How to Get Started With the Anime and Manga    Sasaki and Miyano: How to Get Started With the Anime and Manga  By Nicky Rodriguez Published 17 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   An adorably sweet and wholesome romance series perfect for a quick binge, here's how to get started with the BL anime Sasaki and Miyano.                 Sasaki and Miyano is the perfect anime for anyone looking for\u00a0a short but delightfully sweet binge. A refreshingly wholesome BL series, it's a title fit for anyone looking for some light fare, whether they're deep into the BL genre or not.  Following the announcement of a new anime series being greenlit, there's no better time than now for fans to dive into Sasaki and Miyano in preparation for more to come. RELATED:\u00a0Sasaki and Miyano's Finale Delivers a Satisfying Romance - and Promises More                        The Plot of\u00a0Sasaki and Miyano Sasaki and Miyano follows\u00a0the titular high schoolers\u00a0as their friendship and burgeoning interest in\u00a0BL manga steadily grow into a romance. Sasaki is a year Miyano's senior and seemingly a typical bad boy.\u00a0He originally found himself smitten with Miyano\u00a0after stepping in to stop a fight to keep Miyano, who he found adorable, from getting hurt. Curiously drawn to him and his passionate enthusiasm for BL manga, Sasaki slowly starts to realize the depth of his feelings for his friend.  Played off throughout the series to various degrees of comical effect, the\u00a0series shows just how much these hidden feelings affect Sasaki as he grapples with understanding what it means to fall in love with a friend of the same gender. What's more, despite being a BL lover, it's a while before Miyano realizes just how much his favorite genre has quickly become his reality. This slice-of-life anime is lighthearted and humorous but filled with plenty of heartfelt moments of support between Sasaki, Miyano and their friends. Whether it be about their interest in BL or each other, the overarching themes and relationships in the series are consistently positive -- a welcome deviation from some of the genre's more\u00a0problematic\u00a0portrayals of romance and affection.  RELATED:\u00a0The Best (Healthy) BL Anime on Funimation                        Where to Read the Sasaki and Miyano Manga and Light Novels Sasaki and Miyano\u00a0was created by Shou Harusono in 2016, and the manga was originally serialized online on Pixiv. The manga was later released in tankobon editions by Kadokawa and licensed for Western release by Yen Press, and it's currently still ongoing.

Sasaki and Miyano is the perfect anime for anyone looking for\u00a0a short but delightfully sweet binge. A refreshingly wholesome BL series, it's a title fit for anyone looking for some light fare, whether they're deep into the BL genre or not.  Following the announcement of a new anime series being greenlit, there's no better time than now for fans to dive into Sasaki and Miyano in preparation for more to come. RELATED:\u00a0Sasaki and Miyano's Finale Delivers a Satisfying Romance - and Promises More                        The Plot of\u00a0Sasaki and Miyano Sasaki and Miyano follows\u00a0the titular high schoolers\u00a0as their friendship and burgeoning interest in\u00a0BL manga steadily grow into a romance. Sasaki is a year Miyano's senior and seemingly a typical bad boy.\u00a0He originally found himself smitten with Miyano\u00a0after stepping in to stop a fight to keep Miyano, who he found adorable, from getting hurt. Curiously drawn to him and his passionate enthusiasm for BL manga, Sasaki slowly starts to realize the depth of his feelings for his friend.  Played off throughout the series to various degrees of comical effect, the\u00a0series shows just how much these hidden feelings affect Sasaki as he grapples with understanding what it means to fall in love with a friend of the same gender. What's more, despite being a BL lover, it's a while before Miyano realizes just how much his favorite genre has quickly become his reality. This slice-of-life anime is lighthearted and humorous but filled with plenty of heartfelt moments of support between Sasaki, Miyano and their friends. Whether it be about their interest in BL or each other, the overarching themes and relationships in the series are consistently positive -- a welcome deviation from some of the genre's more\u00a0problematic\u00a0portrayals of romance and affection.  RELATED:\u00a0The Best (Healthy) BL Anime on Funimation                        Where to Read the Sasaki and Miyano Manga and Light Novels Sasaki and Miyano\u00a0was created by Shou Harusono in 2016, and the manga was originally serialized online on Pixiv. The manga was later released in tankobon editions by Kadokawa and licensed for Western release by Yen Press, and it's currently still ongoing. Volumes are available for purchase at RightStufAnime for$10.39, Amazon for $11.70 and Barnes and Noble for $13. Digital editions are available at Barnes and Noble and Kindle and Comixology for $6.99. The manga inspired a two-volume novel series by Kotoko Hachijo in 2018 and 2020, although there has yet to be any news on whether these will see an official English release. There is also a spinoff manga series titled Hirano\u00a0and Kagiura, which is currently serialized in the shojo magazine Monthly Comic Gene. The spinoff has so far been collected in two tankobon, but again, there is no news yet on if it will be licensed for Western audiences.

On July 27, 2022, with the release of the ninth manga volume in Japan, the manga will be bundled with a special OVA episode. Although only a short watch, Sasaki and Miyano\u00a0quickly amassed a dedicated fanbase thanks to its\u00a0charming story, and it won't easily be forgotten. With the manga ongoing and spinoffs already in existence, it's not unlikely that fans will\u00a0have more merch to add to their collection in time.

Home Comics Comic Book Reviews DC's Batman #122 Comic Review    DC's Batman #122 Comic Review  By Sayantan Gayen Published 4 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The narrative of Batman #122 suffers from the crossover nature of the story, but the over-the-top action sequences make for an entertaining read.                                    DC's Batman #122   Artist  Trevor Hairsine, Howard Porter    Colorist  Tomeu Morey, Rain Beredo    Cover Artist  Tomeu Morey, Howard Porter    Letterer  Willie Schubert, Clayton Cowles    Price  4.99    Publisher  DC Comics    Release Date  2022-04-05    Writer  Joshua Williamson      Ra's al Ghul\u00a0has gone by a hundred names, but it is the moniker of the Demon's Head that strikes fear in the hearts of men. After years of fighting the Detective and going toe-to-toe with formidable opponents, the ecoterrorist wants to try a different approach. He gives\u00a0himself up, along with the secrets of the Lazarus pit, to the authorities. When someone dressed as Deathstroke kills Ra's Al Ghul in front of the media, the world is left stunned by the events. Naturally, Talia is out for blood, sending her menagerie of assassins to Deathstroke Inc. as Batman investigates the murder privately. Written by Joshua Williamson with artwork from Howard Porter, Trevor Hairsine, Tomeu Morey, and Rain Beredo and lettering by Clayton Cowles and Willie Schubert, Batman #122 reopens old wounds between warring legacies.  Batman #122 opens on the stairways of the Markovian Embassy in Washington D.C., where the Demon's Head has met his sudden end in the most anticlimactic fashion. Batman is at the crime scene with Director of the D.E.O., Cameron Chase, scrutinizing every minute detail as time is of the essence until the feud between Deathstroke and Talia spills onto the streets. Talia has already made the first move, sending a contingent of ninja assassins to kill Deathstroke in his own Hightower. As Damian and Ravager set out to settle their own scores and vendettas, Batman sneaks into the Demon Palace in Nepal to get some answers. Meanwhile, the backup feature is set in the past as Batman and Deathstroke duke it on the rooftops of Gotham, but something is amiss with the Terminator.  RELATED:\u00a0DC's Batman: Beyond the White Knight #1 Comic Review                Batman #122 sets the stage for an all-out, action-packed event as the three-month-long crossover gets underway. From the get-go, it is evident that the Shadow War arc looks to shake up the status quo enough to make new changes in the DC universe. This issue acts as a stepping stone for such ideas to be realized, introducing the players on the board and acquainting readers with the current world situation. Writer Joshua Williamson floods the book with an abundance of action that meanders past moments of musing, creating a three-fold narrative. The story remains stagnant, despite the omens of impending doom, and unmoved by the intense fight sequences. With Batman caught in the middle of the conflict, the subplot of the murder mystery gives a suspenseful angle to the book. The final few pages of the issue depict the first meeting between Deathstroke and Batman, also written by Williamson, which is as explosive as the main story.  The artwork of Howard Porter captures the chaotic energy of Williamson's writing with his wild use of bold contour lines and rugged pencil work. Porter's art style looks lively and a bit caricaturish at times, which only amplifies the hectic pacing of the book. Tomeu Morey uses bright colors against a dark background to create lighting effects that bring depth to the artwork. However, certain scenes, especially the scenes of brawls, look muddled as the details in the foreground blend with the background. Meanwhile, Trevor Hairsine and Rain Beredo's artwork in the backup\u00a0provides a throwback to the old designs of Batman, Robin, and Deathstroke and gives a closer look into the close-quarter combat.  RELATED:\u00a0DC's Shadow War: Alpha #1 Comic Review                Batman #122 becomes a victim of multi-titled crossover events as the story focuses more on the animosity between the warring factions than the titular hero. Despite that, Williamson portrays a good grasp of the character of Batman, whose detective skills and sensitive nature behind the cowl come to the foreground in the most intimate ways. While the main title has a dynamic flair, the ending of the backup story seems more intriguing. Overall, Batman #122 ends with a reignition of an old romance while ominous calm bellies the oncoming storm.

DC's Batman #122   Artist  Trevor Hairsine, Howard Porter    Colorist  Tomeu Morey, Rain Beredo    Cover Artist  Tomeu Morey, Howard Porter    Letterer  Willie Schubert, Clayton Cowles    Price  4.99    Publisher  DC Comics    Release Date  2022-04-05    Writer  Joshua Williamson      Ra's al Ghul\u00a0has gone by a hundred names, but it is the moniker of the Demon's Head that strikes fear in the hearts of men. After years of fighting the Detective and going toe-to-toe with formidable opponents, the ecoterrorist wants to try a different approach. He gives\u00a0himself up, along with the secrets of the Lazarus pit, to the authorities. When someone dressed as Deathstroke kills Ra's Al Ghul in front of the media, the world is left stunned by the events. Naturally, Talia is out for blood, sending her menagerie of assassins to Deathstroke Inc. as Batman investigates the murder privately. Written by Joshua Williamson with artwork from Howard Porter, Trevor Hairsine, Tomeu Morey, and Rain Beredo and lettering by Clayton Cowles and Willie Schubert, Batman #122 reopens old wounds between warring legacies.  Batman #122 opens on the stairways of the Markovian Embassy in Washington D.C., where the Demon's Head has met his sudden end in the most anticlimactic fashion. Batman is at the crime scene with Director of the D.E.O., Cameron Chase, scrutinizing every minute detail as time is of the essence until the feud between Deathstroke and Talia spills onto the streets. Talia has already made the first move, sending a contingent of ninja assassins to kill Deathstroke in his own Hightower. As Damian and Ravager set out to settle their own scores and vendettas, Batman sneaks into the Demon Palace in Nepal to get some answers. Meanwhile, the backup feature is set in the past as Batman and Deathstroke duke it on the rooftops of Gotham, but something is amiss with the Terminator.  RELATED:\u00a0DC's Batman: Beyond the White Knight #1 Comic Review                Batman #122 sets the stage for an all-out, action-packed event as the three-month-long crossover gets underway. From the get-go, it is evident that the Shadow War arc looks to shake up the status quo enough to make new changes in the DC universe. This issue acts as a stepping stone for such ideas to be realized, introducing the players on the board and acquainting readers with the current world situation. Writer Joshua Williamson floods the book with an abundance of action that meanders past moments of musing, creating a three-fold narrative. The story remains stagnant, despite the omens of impending doom, and unmoved by the intense fight sequences. With Batman caught in the middle of the conflict, the subplot of the murder mystery gives a suspenseful angle to the book. The final few pages of the issue depict the first meeting between Deathstroke and Batman, also written by Williamson, which is as explosive as the main story.  The artwork of Howard Porter captures the chaotic energy of Williamson's writing with his wild use of bold contour lines and rugged pencil work. Porter's art style looks lively and a bit caricaturish at times, which only amplifies the hectic pacing of the book. Tomeu Morey uses bright colors against a dark background to create lighting effects that bring depth to the artwork. However, certain scenes, especially the scenes of brawls, look muddled as the details in the foreground blend with the background. Meanwhile, Trevor Hairsine and Rain Beredo's artwork in the backup\u00a0provides a throwback to the old designs of Batman, Robin, and Deathstroke and gives a closer look into the close-quarter combat.  RELATED:\u00a0DC's Shadow War: Alpha #1 Comic Review                Batman #122 becomes a victim of multi-titled crossover events as the story focuses more on the animosity between the warring factions than the titular hero. Despite that, Williamson portrays a good grasp of the character of Batman, whose detective skills and sensitive nature behind the cowl come to the foreground in the most intimate ways. While the main title has a dynamic flair, the ending of the backup story seems more intriguing. Overall, Batman #122 ends with a reignition of an old romance while ominous calm bellies the oncoming storm.

Urusei Yatsura announced two new additions to its cast and revealed a short teaser trailer.  As reported by Comic Natalie, the new anime reboot of Rumiko Takahashi's classic sci-fi rom-com has announced that actors Maaya Uchida and Mamoru Miyano are joining its cast as the voices of Shinobu Miyake and Shutaro Mendo respectively. New art of each character was revealed alongside photos of their new voice actors. Uchida previously starred in anime such as Food Wars! Shougeki No Shouma, The Promised Neverland, and My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom. Miyano is known for his starring performances\u00a0in Death Note, Free! Iwatobi Swim Club and Chihayafuru, and also voices one of the new villains in the upcoming Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero. A short teaser trailer for the anime was also released, which ends with a short animated glimpse of the series' female lead, Lum.  RELATED:\u00a0Urusei Yatsura Is the O.G of the Harem Genre                                  The new adaptation is being animated by David Production, the studio behind the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime. The series is being directed by Hideya Takahashi (Platinum End,) and Yasuhiro Kimura, who directed\u00a0Jojo's Golden Wind season. Takahashi's iconic characters are being adapted to animation by character designer Yuko Kakihara, who previously worked on The Aquatope on White Sand. Hiroshi Kamiya, who voices Levi in Attack on Titan, will play the series' main protagonist, Ataru, while Don't Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro's Sumire Uesaka will voice Lum.  Urusei Yatsura was the first hit from celebrated manga author Rumiko Takahashi, who would later go on to create equally iconic manga such as Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha. The series tells the story of Ataru Moroboshi, a perverted high school student who is selected by the alien Oni race to participate in a game of tag that will determine the fate of the Earth. In order to stop the Oni from invading the Earth, Ataru has to touch the horns on the head of their princess, Lum, within ten days. RELATED:\u00a0Chainsaw Man, Inuyasha Creator Rumiko Takahashi Win Big at Harvey Awards The series has already been confirmed to run for four seasons, and will adapt the best known stories from Takahashi's original manga, which ran from 1978 - 1987. The show will air in Japan as part of Fuji TV's noitamina programming block. Details about the show's international release have yet to be announced.  The new show\u00a0will be the second animated adaptation of Takahashi's manga. The original anime was broadcast from 1981 - 1986 and was produced by a trio of studios that included Pierrot, which would later go on to animate Naruto, and Studio Deen, which is known for its work on series such as Fruits Basket (2001) and KonoSuba.

Urusei Yatsura announced two new additions to its cast and revealed a short teaser trailer.  As reported by Comic Natalie, the new anime reboot of Rumiko Takahashi's classic sci-fi rom-com has announced that actors Maaya Uchida and Mamoru Miyano are joining its cast as the voices of Shinobu Miyake and Shutaro Mendo respectively. New art of each character was revealed alongside photos of their new voice actors. Uchida previously starred in anime such as Food Wars! Shougeki No Shouma, The Promised Neverland, and My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom. Miyano is known for his starring performances\u00a0in Death Note, Free! Iwatobi Swim Club and Chihayafuru, and also voices one of the new villains in the upcoming Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero. A short teaser trailer for the anime was also released, which ends with a short animated glimpse of the series' female lead, Lum.  RELATED:\u00a0Urusei Yatsura Is the O.G of the Harem Genre                                  The new adaptation is being animated by David Production, the studio behind the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime. The series is being directed by Hideya Takahashi (Platinum End,) and Yasuhiro Kimura, who directed\u00a0Jojo's Golden Wind season. Takahashi's iconic characters are being adapted to animation by character designer Yuko Kakihara, who previously worked on The Aquatope on White Sand. Hiroshi Kamiya, who voices Levi in Attack on Titan, will play the series' main protagonist, Ataru, while Don't Toy With Me, Miss Nagatoro's Sumire Uesaka will voice Lum.  Urusei Yatsura was the first hit from celebrated manga author Rumiko Takahashi, who would later go on to create equally iconic manga such as Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha. The series tells the story of Ataru Moroboshi, a perverted high school student who is selected by the alien Oni race to participate in a game of tag that will determine the fate of the Earth. In order to stop the Oni from invading the Earth, Ataru has to touch the horns on the head of their princess, Lum, within ten days. RELATED:\u00a0Chainsaw Man, Inuyasha Creator Rumiko Takahashi Win Big at Harvey Awards The series has already been confirmed to run for four seasons, and will adapt the best known stories from Takahashi's original manga, which ran from 1978 - 1987. The show will air in Japan as part of Fuji TV's noitamina programming block. Details about the show's international release have yet to be announced.  The new show\u00a0will be the second animated adaptation of Takahashi's manga. The original anime was broadcast from 1981 - 1986 and was produced by a trio of studios that included Pierrot, which would later go on to animate Naruto, and Studio Deen, which is known for its work on series such as Fruits Basket (2001) and KonoSuba.

Home Anime How Naruto\u2019s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's    How Naruto\u2019s Backstory Is Similar to Orient Protagonist Musashi's  By Gregory Segal Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   From being outcasts from society since early childhood to containing powerful beings within them, Naruto and Musashi have quite a lot in common.                 The backstory of Naruto Uzumaki has influenced a plethora of characters within the battle-anime genre, and Orient\u2019s protagonist Musashi appears to be no exception. While these two characters come from very different worlds, they both grew up as outcasts within their society, contain powerful beings inside of them and have a childhood dream of conquering their adversities in an effort to prove to those around them that their assumptions were wrong.  Whether Shinobu Ohtaka took direct inspiration from Masashi Kishimoto\u2019s ramen-loving ninja has yet to be uncovered. However, both of these characters share unmistakable characteristics and backstories that tie the two together. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: How Mai Became a Child Again & How Old She Really Is          Growing Up As An Outcast                On the day of his birth, Naruto became the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tails after his parents -- Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki -- sacrificed themselves to save Konoha from the Ky\u016bbi\u2019s devastating power. Orphaned, Naruto would live a lonely existence, as few of the people within his village could put aside their losses after the disaster that had taken place. Naruto would be openly ostracized, resented and feared by those around him for containing the Nine-Tails.  While Musashi\u2019s parents were simple farmers rather than acting leaders within Tatsuyama, they too died shortly after their son's birth. Like Naruto, Musashi was rejected by those around him as he wandered from family to family seeking shelter. A group of his relatives eventually took him in; however, their relationship was abusive, and they would only promise Musashi respite if he was to throw stones and insults at his friend\u2019s father and his personal mentor Jisai Kanemaki. Unlike Naruto, Musashi was not rejected by those around him because of the creature contained inside of him (the Obsidian Goddess). However, both characters share the experience of becoming an outcast due to their associations. Ultimately, Musashi was forsaken because of his friendship with a Bushi warrior rather than his personality or actions. As children, both Naruto and Musashi found it difficult to understand why people had a hatred for them, as it stemmed from a fear of the unknown.  RELATED: Is Samurai Flamenco Just a Failed Version of Tiger & Bunny?          The Obsidian Goddess and The Nine-Tails Beast                Currently, very little is understood about the Obsidian Goddess contained within Musashi. Whether this is a creature from another world or, like Naruto\u2019s Ky\u016bbi, a more earthly spirit, remains to be seen. However, both characters have managed to get out of a few tight situations that their skills and powers would otherwise be incapable of doing with the help of their internal companions. Within Episode 11 of Orient\u2019s first season, Musashi transformed into the Obsidian Goddess and was consequently able to force Shiro and Nanao Inukai into fleeing, despite hundreds of other Bushi being unable to do so. Naruto too has oftentimes used the Nine-Tails\u2019 chakra to outwit or outpower his opponents in an effort to get out of a sticky situation that he would usually fall folly to.  RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship?          Childhood Dreams                Musashi\u2019s dream of creating a Bushi Band and Naruto\u2019s endeavor of becoming the Hokage of Konoha village are obviously quite different. However, the two characters share the trait of using their fantasies to gain the inner strength to push through difficult situations. Despite a fierce campaign of propaganda that the Bushi are the devils of Hinomoto who will stop at nothing to destroy the nation's Kishin gods, Musashi remains convinced in his belief that they are truly good. Likewise, Naruto is committed to his dream of becoming a leader strong enough to gain the respect of his fellow villagers, regardless of the ridicule that he faces due to being a jinch\u016briki.  Ultimately, while the characters might be different in their appearances, catch-phrases or overarching goals, they are at their core very similar. Musashi and Naruto have had immensely difficult childhoods, have been entrusted with a powerful creature and hold dreams that, despite others' disbelief, enable them to overcome their hardships. When Season 2 of Orient airs this summer, it will be interesting to see if Musashi\u2019s backstory will reveal further similarities with Konoha\u2019s most powerful ninja.

The backstory of Naruto Uzumaki has influenced a plethora of characters within the battle-anime genre, and Orient\u2019s protagonist Musashi appears to be no exception. While these two characters come from very different worlds, they both grew up as outcasts within their society, contain powerful beings inside of them and have a childhood dream of conquering their adversities in an effort to prove to those around them that their assumptions were wrong.  Whether Shinobu Ohtaka took direct inspiration from Masashi Kishimoto\u2019s ramen-loving ninja has yet to be uncovered. However, both of these characters share unmistakable characteristics and backstories that tie the two together. RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: How Mai Became a Child Again & How Old She Really Is          Growing Up As An Outcast                On the day of his birth, Naruto became the jinch\u016briki of the Nine-Tails after his parents -- Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki -- sacrificed themselves to save Konoha from the Ky\u016bbi\u2019s devastating power. Orphaned, Naruto would live a lonely existence, as few of the people within his village could put aside their losses after the disaster that had taken place. Naruto would be openly ostracized, resented and feared by those around him for containing the Nine-Tails.  While Musashi\u2019s parents were simple farmers rather than acting leaders within Tatsuyama, they too died shortly after their son's birth. Like Naruto, Musashi was rejected by those around him as he wandered from family to family seeking shelter. A group of his relatives eventually took him in; however, their relationship was abusive, and they would only promise Musashi respite if he was to throw stones and insults at his friend\u2019s father and his personal mentor Jisai Kanemaki. Unlike Naruto, Musashi was not rejected by those around him because of the creature contained inside of him (the Obsidian Goddess). However, both characters share the experience of becoming an outcast due to their associations. Ultimately, Musashi was forsaken because of his friendship with a Bushi warrior rather than his personality or actions. As children, both Naruto and Musashi found it difficult to understand why people had a hatred for them, as it stemmed from a fear of the unknown.  RELATED: Is Samurai Flamenco Just a Failed Version of Tiger & Bunny?          The Obsidian Goddess and The Nine-Tails Beast                Currently, very little is understood about the Obsidian Goddess contained within Musashi. Whether this is a creature from another world or, like Naruto\u2019s Ky\u016bbi, a more earthly spirit, remains to be seen. However, both characters have managed to get out of a few tight situations that their skills and powers would otherwise be incapable of doing with the help of their internal companions. Within Episode 11 of Orient\u2019s first season, Musashi transformed into the Obsidian Goddess and was consequently able to force Shiro and Nanao Inukai into fleeing, despite hundreds of other Bushi being unable to do so. Naruto too has oftentimes used the Nine-Tails\u2019 chakra to outwit or outpower his opponents in an effort to get out of a sticky situation that he would usually fall folly to.  RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship?          Childhood Dreams                Musashi\u2019s dream of creating a Bushi Band and Naruto\u2019s endeavor of becoming the Hokage of Konoha village are obviously quite different. However, the two characters share the trait of using their fantasies to gain the inner strength to push through difficult situations. Despite a fierce campaign of propaganda that the Bushi are the devils of Hinomoto who will stop at nothing to destroy the nation's Kishin gods, Musashi remains convinced in his belief that they are truly good. Likewise, Naruto is committed to his dream of becoming a leader strong enough to gain the respect of his fellow villagers, regardless of the ridicule that he faces due to being a jinch\u016briki.  Ultimately, while the characters might be different in their appearances, catch-phrases or overarching goals, they are at their core very similar. Musashi and Naruto have had immensely difficult childhoods, have been entrusted with a powerful creature and hold dreams that, despite others' disbelief, enable them to overcome their hardships. When Season 2 of Orient airs this summer, it will be interesting to see if Musashi\u2019s backstory will reveal further similarities with Konoha\u2019s most powerful ninja.

Golden Kamuy will conclude before the end of April.  As reported by Anime News Network, publisher Shueisha announced that the 312th chapter of the critically-acclaimed historical manga will be published on April 14, followed by Chapter 313 on April 21, and the series' grand finale, Chapter 314, on April 28. The final collected volumes will also be compiled before the end of summer, with Volume 29 releasing in Japan on April 19, followed by Volume 30 on June 17, and the 31st and final volume dropping on July 19. English release dates for these volumes have yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0What Historical Anime to Watch After The Heike Story The series began publication of its final story arc last July. The arc began after series creator Satoru Noda went on a month-long hiatus to\u00a0do research and planning work on the manga's finale. Golden Kamuy is set in the early 1900s\u00a0and incorporates many real-life historical figures and events into its story. The series has been lauded for its historical accuracy and for its representation of the Ainu people, who are an indigenous population from Japan's northern regions. The manga won the prestigious Manga Taisho award in 2016 and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2018.  Golden Kamuy tells the story of Saichi Sugimoto, a veteran of one of the bloodiest battles of the Russo-Japanese War, who is searching through\u00a0Japan's northern island of Hokkaido for a fabled treasure trove of gold hidden by the Ainu. Sugimoto teams up with a young girl, Asirpa, who is seeking to avenge the death of her father, who was one of the Ainu miners that originally discovered the gold. The two travel throughout Hokkaido, unraveling clues about the treasure's location while fighting other fortune\u00a0hunters who want to steal\u00a0the gold for themselves. RELATED:\u00a0To Your Eternity Releases Key Art for Anime's Second Season  The series was first adapted into an anime by Geno Studio, which was one of the anime production companies that was chosen by Lucasfilm to contribute to 2021's\u00a0Star Wars: Visions anime anthology. The anime adaptation was similarly well received and ran\u00a0for two seasons in 2018. A third season was broadcast in 2020. The series will return for a fourth season this fall. Production on the fourth season is being moved over to Brains Base, the animation studio behind the anime adaptations of Assassination Classroom and To Your Eternity,\u00a0which is also scheduled to premiere a new season next fall.    The Golden Kamuy manga is localized and distributed in English by VIZ Media. The first three seasons of the anime are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

Back at the conclusion of 2005's \"House of M,\" Wanda Maximoff, aka the Scarlet Witch, uttered three\u00a0words that would forever change a entire species within the Marvel Universe:\u00a0\"No more mutants.\" However, now that the X-Men have managed to unite the majority of their kind on the island of Krakoa and the planet of Arrako, it appears that Wanda may have been correct in her summation of there being entirely too many mutants.  As it currently stands, the various X-titles are nearly bursting at the seams with a vast assortment of both heroic and villainous mutants. Although it does give rather obscure characters a new chance to shine, it also necessitates a number of internet searches, and may create a difficult chasm for newer readers to cross. Related:\u00a0Legion of X Will Reveal the Reason Juggernaut Was Put on Krakoa - And It's Not What He Thinks                The original X-Men lineup back in 1963\u00a0consisted of a mere six members: Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Angel, Iceman and Professor X, doubling as both mentor and leader. 1975's\u00a0Giant-Size X-Men #1 (by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum) introduced a new roster of seven iconic members who, with the exception of Wolverine, were entirely new characters. This team proved almost immediately popular and remained the core of the book for years, fighting various villains and occasionally bringing in more allies.  In the decades that followed, writers and artists\u00a0continued to create new mutant characters to populate the Marvel Universe. Uncanny X-Men and X-Factor led the charge, soon joined by X-Force, X-Men, New Mutants, and so forth. Even though the rosters of the teams would shuffle around every year or so, there was usually a core team represented from month to month. With the constant additions to both the heroic and villainous casts, the mutant population grew steadily from a mere seven to\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0characters as the number of titles increased from two to a dozen. When Scarlet Witch whispered those fateful words\u00a0she changed reality,\u00a0effectively reducing the vast mutant population to a mere 198. It was a huge paradigm shift,\u00a0that opened up many new avenues for storytelling. In a matter of moments, mutants were no longer the dominant species on earth but had actually become endangered.\u00a0After years of their future being in jeopardy, Hope Summers was born, giving the species hope as their numbers slowly began to rise.  Related:\u00a0The X-Men Sentenced a Child to Krakoa's Worst Punishment - Were They Right?                Enter Jonathan Hickman. Not only did he unite good and evil mutants alike under the banner of the island nation of Krakoa, but he introduced mutant resurrection. Mutants who had died long ago were brought back into the modern era. All mutant deaths are now reversible, with even mutants who had lost their powers now able to be restored to their initial state. The mutant population of Marvel have made an incredible comeback as a result, and the mass majority of them are united as a part of the X-Men's first society. This makes for quite a few\u00a0powered characters appearing on the printed\u00a0page at any given time. Take Hellions, for example. This team has a core roster of Havok, Psylocke, Greycrow, Wild Child, Orphan-Maker, Nanny, and Empath. Mr. Sinister is their unreliable leader. While eight members is a manageable number of characters, one mention of The Five (who make resurrection possible) brings that number to 13. If the governing body of Krakoa (the Quiet Council)\u00a0appears, there are suddenly eight more mutants on the page.                 The introduction of mass resurrections in the world of the X-Men means that there is now a massive number of characters vying for time in the spotlight. This can result in quite a few internet searches even for the most seasoned fan of the team, possibly bringing with it a sense of disconnect among established readers. For new readers who might only be familiar with the X-Men movies or various animated versions, this huge cast of mutant characters is sure to be daunting, to say the least. Opening pages that give a roster of important characters appearing in the story is a step in the right direction, but may still be too much for more casual readers. As great as the recent transformation of the X-Men titles has been, it is essential for the rosters to be kept under control in order to sway from the danger of alienating both new and old readers alike.

Back at the conclusion of 2005's \"House of M,\" Wanda Maximoff, aka the Scarlet Witch, uttered three\u00a0words that would forever change a entire species within the Marvel Universe:\u00a0\"No more mutants.\" However, now that the X-Men have managed to unite the majority of their kind on the island of Krakoa and the planet of Arrako, it appears that Wanda may have been correct in her summation of there being entirely too many mutants.  As it currently stands, the various X-titles are nearly bursting at the seams with a vast assortment of both heroic and villainous mutants. Although it does give rather obscure characters a new chance to shine, it also necessitates a number of internet searches, and may create a difficult chasm for newer readers to cross. Related:\u00a0Legion of X Will Reveal the Reason Juggernaut Was Put on Krakoa - And It's Not What He Thinks                The original X-Men lineup back in 1963\u00a0consisted of a mere six members: Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Angel, Iceman and Professor X, doubling as both mentor and leader. 1975's\u00a0Giant-Size X-Men #1 (by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum) introduced a new roster of seven iconic members who, with the exception of Wolverine, were entirely new characters. This team proved almost immediately popular and remained the core of the book for years, fighting various villains and occasionally bringing in more allies.  In the decades that followed, writers and artists\u00a0continued to create new mutant characters to populate the Marvel Universe. Uncanny X-Men and X-Factor led the charge, soon joined by X-Force, X-Men, New Mutants, and so forth. Even though the rosters of the teams would shuffle around every year or so, there was usually a core team represented from month to month. With the constant additions to both the heroic and villainous casts, the mutant population grew steadily from a mere seven to\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0characters as the number of titles increased from two to a dozen. When Scarlet Witch whispered those fateful words\u00a0she changed reality,\u00a0effectively reducing the vast mutant population to a mere 198. It was a huge paradigm shift,\u00a0that opened up many new avenues for storytelling. In a matter of moments, mutants were no longer the dominant species on earth but had actually become endangered.\u00a0After years of their future being in jeopardy, Hope Summers was born, giving the species hope as their numbers slowly began to rise.  Related:\u00a0The X-Men Sentenced a Child to Krakoa's Worst Punishment - Were They Right?                Enter Jonathan Hickman. Not only did he unite good and evil mutants alike under the banner of the island nation of Krakoa, but he introduced mutant resurrection. Mutants who had died long ago were brought back into the modern era. All mutant deaths are now reversible, with even mutants who had lost their powers now able to be restored to their initial state. The mutant population of Marvel have made an incredible comeback as a result, and the mass majority of them are united as a part of the X-Men's first society. This makes for quite a few\u00a0powered characters appearing on the printed\u00a0page at any given time. Take Hellions, for example. This team has a core roster of Havok, Psylocke, Greycrow, Wild Child, Orphan-Maker, Nanny, and Empath. Mr. Sinister is their unreliable leader. While eight members is a manageable number of characters, one mention of The Five (who make resurrection possible) brings that number to 13. If the governing body of Krakoa (the Quiet Council)\u00a0appears, there are suddenly eight more mutants on the page.                 The introduction of mass resurrections in the world of the X-Men means that there is now a massive number of characters vying for time in the spotlight. This can result in quite a few internet searches even for the most seasoned fan of the team, possibly bringing with it a sense of disconnect among established readers. For new readers who might only be familiar with the X-Men movies or various animated versions, this huge cast of mutant characters is sure to be daunting, to say the least. Opening pages that give a roster of important characters appearing in the story is a step in the right direction, but may still be too much for more casual readers. As great as the recent transformation of the X-Men titles has been, it is essential for the rosters to be kept under control in order to sway from the danger of alienating both new and old readers alike.

Home Anime These Literary Classics Prove That Isekai Isn\u2019t Only a Japanese Thing    These Literary Classics Prove That Isekai Isn\u2019t Only a Japanese Thing  By Christopher Nishijima Published 21 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Tales of jumping between worlds may be associated with anime and Japanese light novels today, but these books shine a light on the trope's origins.                 There's no denying that isekai as a genre has only developed as far as it has thanks to its wide success in Japanese pop fiction. After all, the vast majority of works that utilize storylines wherein a protagonist is swept away to a new land come from light novels and anime.  Nevertheless, while many critics of the device dismiss it as otaku power fantasies, they often fail to recognize that the idea was inspired by various works of Western literature. Demonstrating the origins of this fantasy subgroup is a collection of\u00a0English isekai stories that have stood the test of time and proven their influence on the modern state of their Japanese successors. RELATED:\u00a0Wikipedia's April Fools' Gag Involves Isekai Anime\u2019s Most Common Trope          Peter Pan - The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up                With its emphasis on the idyllic and carefree nature of childhood,\u00a0Peter Pan creates an entire world around the idea of playing pretend. J.M. Barrie crafted one of the most iconic isekai of Western literature, filled with mermaids, feral children and pirates, to be visited by Wendy Darling and her brothers John and Michael. Although its plot may serve as a coming-of-age story, driving home the importance of growing up at some point in time, its legacy has solidified it as the image of escapism.  In essence, the dreamlike atmosphere of this tale is not unlike the wish-fulfillment distractions that fill modern isekai anime. Just as series like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero and\u00a0That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime base their realities on the hallmarks and mechanics of fantasy roleplay games, the logic and denizens of Neverland are ruled by a kind of childlike whimsy. Both function similarly for their fans, providing a welcome reprieve from the harsh realities of society.          The Chronicles of Narnia - The Land of the Great Lion                Originating with the classic novel\u00a0The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is another beloved isekai series from the British Isles. Following the friends and members of the Pevensie family, each entry transports a group of adolescents to the magical realm of Narnia to thwart some malicious threat. This world is inhabited by numerous fantastical races like centaurs and nymphs, along with humans and talking animals -- the greatest of which is the Great Lion Aslan, true ruler of all.  Even though the various child protagonists of the series ended up in Narnia through accidental circumstances, the books imply that Narnia called each of them specifically because they could help in its hour of need. In a way, this could be seen as an early precursor to anime like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero or\u00a0How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom wherein heroes are summoned to save the world from a looming evil. Indeed, with its sprawling geography and interconnected political workings, Narnia has all the key components of a thoroughly developed high fantasy isekai. RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai          The Wizard of Oz - Follow the Yellow Brick Road                One of the first American isekai to enjoy critical acclaim and wide publication, L. Frank Baum's\u00a0The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u00a0is one of history's most important pieces of fiction. Dorothy Gale's journey through Oz spawned a myriad of iconic characters and has inspired countless adaptations and retellings. In addition to acting as a muse for many later works, its movie version marked a massive change in the film and television industry. Although later books in the series would prolong the escapades of Dorothy and her acquaintances, the original novel was largely focused on the idea of her just trying to get back to her own world. This treatment of the fantasy adventure as secondary to the goal of returning home is something that many old school isekai implemented, such as\u00a0Digimon Adventure,\u00a0The Vision of Escaflowne and\u00a0Fushigi Yuugi. Still, just as the\u00a0Oz books eventually had Dorothy permanently relocate to Oz, today's isekai tend to leave their protagonists in another world indefinitely, either through reincarnation or by simply stranding them there with no means of return.          Alice in Wonderland - We're All Mad Here                Perhaps the most famous example of otherworldly travel in fiction is Lewis Carrol's\u00a0Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as its sequel\u00a0Through the Looking Glass. This piece of British literature\u00a0is often considered the first work to\u00a0ever formally use displacement in a parallel world as its central premise. As such, its introduction of the idea makes it the common ancestor of all isekai. Due to its surreal aesthetic, Alice in Wonderland may not have much in common thematically with the more plot-based stories that came after it. However, its influence on countless anime is impossible to ignore. This can be seen in isekai titles such as Magic Knight Rayearth, with its white rabbit-like Mokona, and\u00a0Inuyasha, where its protagonist literally falls down a hole to another reality. Even the gritty death game isekai\u00a0Alice In Borderland borrows from the playing card symbolism, showing just how deep the love for Carrol's masterpiece runs among isekai writers.

There's no denying that isekai as a genre has only developed as far as it has thanks to its wide success in Japanese pop fiction. After all, the vast majority of works that utilize storylines wherein a protagonist is swept away to a new land come from light novels and anime.  Nevertheless, while many critics of the device dismiss it as otaku power fantasies, they often fail to recognize that the idea was inspired by various works of Western literature. Demonstrating the origins of this fantasy subgroup is a collection of\u00a0English isekai stories that have stood the test of time and proven their influence on the modern state of their Japanese successors. RELATED:\u00a0Wikipedia's April Fools' Gag Involves Isekai Anime\u2019s Most Common Trope          Peter Pan - The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up                With its emphasis on the idyllic and carefree nature of childhood,\u00a0Peter Pan creates an entire world around the idea of playing pretend. J.M. Barrie crafted one of the most iconic isekai of Western literature, filled with mermaids, feral children and pirates, to be visited by Wendy Darling and her brothers John and Michael. Although its plot may serve as a coming-of-age story, driving home the importance of growing up at some point in time, its legacy has solidified it as the image of escapism.  In essence, the dreamlike atmosphere of this tale is not unlike the wish-fulfillment distractions that fill modern isekai anime. Just as series like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero and\u00a0That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime base their realities on the hallmarks and mechanics of fantasy roleplay games, the logic and denizens of Neverland are ruled by a kind of childlike whimsy. Both function similarly for their fans, providing a welcome reprieve from the harsh realities of society.          The Chronicles of Narnia - The Land of the Great Lion                Originating with the classic novel\u00a0The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, C.S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia is another beloved isekai series from the British Isles. Following the friends and members of the Pevensie family, each entry transports a group of adolescents to the magical realm of Narnia to thwart some malicious threat. This world is inhabited by numerous fantastical races like centaurs and nymphs, along with humans and talking animals -- the greatest of which is the Great Lion Aslan, true ruler of all.  Even though the various child protagonists of the series ended up in Narnia through accidental circumstances, the books imply that Narnia called each of them specifically because they could help in its hour of need. In a way, this could be seen as an early precursor to anime like\u00a0The Rising of the Shield Hero or\u00a0How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom wherein heroes are summoned to save the world from a looming evil. Indeed, with its sprawling geography and interconnected political workings, Narnia has all the key components of a thoroughly developed high fantasy isekai. RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai          The Wizard of Oz - Follow the Yellow Brick Road                One of the first American isekai to enjoy critical acclaim and wide publication, L. Frank Baum's\u00a0The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u00a0is one of history's most important pieces of fiction. Dorothy Gale's journey through Oz spawned a myriad of iconic characters and has inspired countless adaptations and retellings. In addition to acting as a muse for many later works, its movie version marked a massive change in the film and television industry. Although later books in the series would prolong the escapades of Dorothy and her acquaintances, the original novel was largely focused on the idea of her just trying to get back to her own world. This treatment of the fantasy adventure as secondary to the goal of returning home is something that many old school isekai implemented, such as\u00a0Digimon Adventure,\u00a0The Vision of Escaflowne and\u00a0Fushigi Yuugi. Still, just as the\u00a0Oz books eventually had Dorothy permanently relocate to Oz, today's isekai tend to leave their protagonists in another world indefinitely, either through reincarnation or by simply stranding them there with no means of return.          Alice in Wonderland - We're All Mad Here                Perhaps the most famous example of otherworldly travel in fiction is Lewis Carrol's\u00a0Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as its sequel\u00a0Through the Looking Glass. This piece of British literature\u00a0is often considered the first work to\u00a0ever formally use displacement in a parallel world as its central premise. As such, its introduction of the idea makes it the common ancestor of all isekai. Due to its surreal aesthetic, Alice in Wonderland may not have much in common thematically with the more plot-based stories that came after it. However, its influence on countless anime is impossible to ignore. This can be seen in isekai titles such as Magic Knight Rayearth, with its white rabbit-like Mokona, and\u00a0Inuyasha, where its protagonist literally falls down a hole to another reality. Even the gritty death game isekai\u00a0Alice In Borderland borrows from the playing card symbolism, showing just how deep the love for Carrol's masterpiece runs among isekai writers.

Marvel's Spider-Punk #1   Artist  Justin Mason    Colorist  Jim Charalampidis    Cover Artist  Alejandro Sanchez, Olivier Coipel    Letterer  VC's Travis Lanham    Price  3.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Cody Ziglar      Spider-Punk is among the wackiest alternate Earth versions of Spider-Man in the Marvel universe, who made their appearance during 2014\u2019s Spider-Verse saga. The foul-mouthed, punk-loving teenager Hobart Brown got his powers from a radioactive spider. Spider-Punk used his gifts to take down President Osborn, who had plunged his homeworld of Earth-138 into an authoritarian regime,\u00a0by bashing him to death with his guitar. Now, the anti-fascist hero, along with his anarchist friends, keeps their neighborhood and community safe from Nazis. Spider-Punk finally gets his much-deserved solo series, written by Cody Ziglar with artwork from Justin Mason and Jim Charalampidis and lettering from VC's Travis Lanham.  Spider-Punk #1 starts off the five-issue miniseries with a bang. Set in a dystopian world where punk rock reigns supreme, Hobie and his friends, the freedom fighter Karl Morningdew (Captain Anarchy) and the genius Riri Williams (Riot Heart), fight fascists like Nazi-punks Kraven\u00a0and the Hunters to keep their city safe. When a near-fatal altercation makes the Spider-Band takes a closer look at the tech brandished by Kraven and his gang, they are surprised at the energy level emanating from the weapon. Kraven returns for round two,\u00a0this time with an ace up in his sleeve. Spider-Punk and his band of anarchists\u00a0must step up to defeat this new threat.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Dark Ages #6 Comic Review                When the fascists come out to play, the friendly jammin' Spider-Punk and his trusty guitar are here to help. Cody Ziglar writes the character with a lot of spunk and spirit,\u00a0spewing profanities at every chance and never backing down from a good brawl. More importantly, he fights to keep his city free, with his friends having his back through thick and thin. Spider-Punk #1 moves in a linear fashion with little to no exposition hindering the progression of events and intermittent fight sequences, which keeps the intrigue going. Ziglar livens up the world of Earth-138 using colorful language and a plot-driven story, even giving some mainstream characters a cultural update.  The artwork of Spider-Punk #1 is an absolute blast, taking the wacky energy of punk rock and giving it life through a series of boldly inked and cartoonishly stylized illustrations. Artist Justin Mason employs striking action lines and frames the characters in dynamic poses to create eye-catching panels. However, the designs of newly introduced characters look generic and akin to their Earth-616 counterparts, with some punk motifs slapped on them. That said, the ultimate pizzazz emanates from the coloring of the book, creating a visual feast for the eyes. Colorist Jim Charalampidis uses the brightest of shades and a slew of tertiary colors, even incorporating Travis Lanham's lettering into the effects, to pop out the punk feel of the dystopian world.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Hulk #5 Comic Review                Spider-Punk #1 swings off to a great start with a pretty solid story told at an enthralling pace that keeps the readers rooted to their seats. The creative team aptly captures the vibrant world of Earth-138, filling it with spikes, mohawks, and emo hairstyles in a multitude of colors, each reflecting the personality of its wearer. Hobie is just as reckless as he was in his first appearance, but this time he has friends who keep him straight. It is endearing to hear them have a banter amongst themselves.\u00a0Spider-Punk #1 welcomes new and established readers with an end that promises even more\u00a0rockin' battles.

Marvel's Spider-Punk #1   Artist  Justin Mason    Colorist  Jim Charalampidis    Cover Artist  Alejandro Sanchez, Olivier Coipel    Letterer  VC's Travis Lanham    Price  3.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Cody Ziglar      Spider-Punk is among the wackiest alternate Earth versions of Spider-Man in the Marvel universe, who made their appearance during 2014\u2019s Spider-Verse saga. The foul-mouthed, punk-loving teenager Hobart Brown got his powers from a radioactive spider. Spider-Punk used his gifts to take down President Osborn, who had plunged his homeworld of Earth-138 into an authoritarian regime,\u00a0by bashing him to death with his guitar. Now, the anti-fascist hero, along with his anarchist friends, keeps their neighborhood and community safe from Nazis. Spider-Punk finally gets his much-deserved solo series, written by Cody Ziglar with artwork from Justin Mason and Jim Charalampidis and lettering from VC's Travis Lanham.  Spider-Punk #1 starts off the five-issue miniseries with a bang. Set in a dystopian world where punk rock reigns supreme, Hobie and his friends, the freedom fighter Karl Morningdew (Captain Anarchy) and the genius Riri Williams (Riot Heart), fight fascists like Nazi-punks Kraven\u00a0and the Hunters to keep their city safe. When a near-fatal altercation makes the Spider-Band takes a closer look at the tech brandished by Kraven and his gang, they are surprised at the energy level emanating from the weapon. Kraven returns for round two,\u00a0this time with an ace up in his sleeve. Spider-Punk and his band of anarchists\u00a0must step up to defeat this new threat.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Dark Ages #6 Comic Review                When the fascists come out to play, the friendly jammin' Spider-Punk and his trusty guitar are here to help. Cody Ziglar writes the character with a lot of spunk and spirit,\u00a0spewing profanities at every chance and never backing down from a good brawl. More importantly, he fights to keep his city free, with his friends having his back through thick and thin. Spider-Punk #1 moves in a linear fashion with little to no exposition hindering the progression of events and intermittent fight sequences, which keeps the intrigue going. Ziglar livens up the world of Earth-138 using colorful language and a plot-driven story, even giving some mainstream characters a cultural update.  The artwork of Spider-Punk #1 is an absolute blast, taking the wacky energy of punk rock and giving it life through a series of boldly inked and cartoonishly stylized illustrations. Artist Justin Mason employs striking action lines and frames the characters in dynamic poses to create eye-catching panels. However, the designs of newly introduced characters look generic and akin to their Earth-616 counterparts, with some punk motifs slapped on them. That said, the ultimate pizzazz emanates from the coloring of the book, creating a visual feast for the eyes. Colorist Jim Charalampidis uses the brightest of shades and a slew of tertiary colors, even incorporating Travis Lanham's lettering into the effects, to pop out the punk feel of the dystopian world.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Hulk #5 Comic Review                Spider-Punk #1 swings off to a great start with a pretty solid story told at an enthralling pace that keeps the readers rooted to their seats. The creative team aptly captures the vibrant world of Earth-138, filling it with spikes, mohawks, and emo hairstyles in a multitude of colors, each reflecting the personality of its wearer. Hobie is just as reckless as he was in his first appearance, but this time he has friends who keep him straight. It is endearing to hear them have a banter amongst themselves.\u00a0Spider-Punk #1 welcomes new and established readers with an end that promises even more\u00a0rockin' battles.

Brian Hagan, art director for DCUO, released art design featuring the Death Metal versions of Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman in conjunction with an interview about the new release. RELATED: Andy Biersack Channels His Batman 'Obsession' Into DC's Dark Nights: Death Metal Soundtrack                Dark Knights marks the newest chapter for D.C. Universe Online,\u00a0presenting the greatest threat since the arrival of Lex Luther's Legion of Doom which debuted in December of last year. A direct continuation of the previous stories in the Legion of Doom arc, the upcoming update will conclude the events from Metal Part I, Metal Part 2, Birds of Prey, Wonderverse and House of Legends.  The Dark Knights are a team of multiple evil and twisted versions of Batman from the Dark Multiverse assembled by a version of the Dark Knight known as The Batman Who Laughs. Having escaped the Source Wall, Perpetua is now remaking the Multiverse by destroying worlds and siphoning power from the evil ones. Perpetua freed The Batman Who Laughs to create his own twisted realities as he pleases. Now, an alliance of heroes and villains must come together to defeat Perpetua once and for all. RELATED: Whatever Happened to the Batman Who Laughs? Along with the explosive conclusion to this multi-story arc, there are a few gameplay mechanics players can expect from Dark Knights. Along with normal and elite versions of all On Duty content, Dark Knights offers level-agnostic event versions for a limited time. Dark Knights also includes open-world missions with storylines set across the Multiverse, including the almost-destroyed version of Washington D.C. and even the Source Wall itself. New players can expect something extra, too, as the episode launches new player rewards that include gear, styles and base items.  D.C. Universe Online marked its tenth anniversary in 2021, and at that time, Dimensional Ink CEO Jack Emmert assured players that significant changes were to come. \"Previously, each of our updates were very self-contained,\" he said. \"But now, we're going to be working towards something that takes place throughout the year. While each story will be complete unto itself, it's going to be part of something much bigger.\" Part of this promise may include the graphics upgrade coming to D.C. Universe Online sometime in 2023, as revealed by a third-quarter financial report last year. The report also revealed Dimensional Ink is developing a new big-budget MMO based on Marvel comics, with no confirmed release date.

Netflix released Ultraman's new Season 2 opening sequence.  The new title sequence shows off\u00a0several of the show's new characters, including the mysterious new alien Maya, and the series' newly expanded roster of galactic protectors, which sees\u00a0Season 1's Ultraman,\u00a0Ultraman Seven and Ultraman Taro joined by three new heroes: Ultraman Zoffy, Ultraman Jack, and Ultraman Ace. The six Ultramen\u00a0will have to combine their powers\u00a0to solve\u00a0the mystery surrounding a mass disappearance on Earth and protect the planet from the alien force known as Dark Star. RELATED:\u00a0Jim Lee Shares Explosive Ultraman Tribute Art    The second season of Ultraman is scheduled to premiere exclusively on Netflix on April 14. The season will be six episodes long.  The CG-animated series\u00a0is based on a 2011 manga written by Eiichi Shimizu and drawn by Tomohiro Shimoguchi. The series tells the story of Shinjiro Hayata, the son of original Ultraman\u00a0protagonist Shin Hayata, and serves as a direct sequel to the classic 1966 live-action series. While it continues the story of the original show, it is set in a different continuity that ignores the events of all of the franchise's subsequent sequel series and spinoffs. Season 2's new lineup of heroes is an homage to the franchise's original Six Ultra Brothers crossover, which appeared in 1972's\u00a0Ultraman Ace series.  RELATED:\u00a0Godzilla, Evangelion, Ultraman and Kamen Rider Team Up for Hideaki Anno Collab The anime adaptation is produced\u00a0by Production IG (Ghost in the Shell, Star Wars: Visions) and Sola Digital Arts (Lord of the Rings: War of Rohirrim). Production on the series is lead by the directorial duo of\u00a0Kenji Kamiya and Shinji Aramaki, who are best known for their work on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and who also recently teamed up to helm the new Blade Runner animated series, Black Lotus, which aired on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll this past fall. The two are now working on the second season of Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045, which will also stream as a Netflix exclusive next May.  Also premiering in Japan in May is Shin Ultraman, the live-action theatrical reboot of the franchise. The movie is being helmed\u00a0by Shin Godzilla co-director Shinji Higuchi and features a screenplay by Neon Genesis Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno. The movie is the second film in Anno's \"Shin\" series, and will be followed up by the release of Shin Kamen Rider, which Anno is directing himself, in 2023. Shimizu and Shimoguchi's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media. The first season of the anime is now\u00a0available for streaming on Netflix.

Season 2's new lineup of heroes is an homage to the franchise's original Six Ultra Brothers crossover, which appeared in 1972's\u00a0Ultraman Ace series.  RELATED:\u00a0Godzilla, Evangelion, Ultraman and Kamen Rider Team Up for Hideaki Anno Collab The anime adaptation is produced\u00a0by Production IG (Ghost in the Shell, Star Wars: Visions) and Sola Digital Arts (Lord of the Rings: War of Rohirrim). Production on the series is lead by the directorial duo of\u00a0Kenji Kamiya and Shinji Aramaki, who are best known for their work on Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and who also recently teamed up to helm the new Blade Runner animated series, Black Lotus, which aired on Adult Swim and Crunchyroll this past fall. The two are now working on the second season of Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045, which will also stream as a Netflix exclusive next May.  Also premiering in Japan in May is Shin Ultraman, the live-action theatrical reboot of the franchise. The movie is being helmed\u00a0by Shin Godzilla co-director Shinji Higuchi and features a screenplay by Neon Genesis Evangelion creator Hideaki Anno. The movie is the second film in Anno's \"Shin\" series, and will be followed up by the release of Shin Kamen Rider, which Anno is directing himself, in 2023. Shimizu and Shimoguchi's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media. The first season of the anime is now\u00a0available for streaming on Netflix.

A new poll named\u00a0Spy x Family the most anticipated anime of the season.  As reported by Crunchyroll, Japan's largest entertainment review site, Filmarks, asked its readers to vote for their most anticipated new series of the spring 2022 season, which includes heavy hitters such as the second season of the popular isekai anime The Rising of the Shield Hero, the third season of the acclaimed romantic-comedy series Kaguya-sama: Love is War and the new psychological thriller Summer Time Rendering, which is being released internationally as the first Disney+ exclusive anime series. These juggernauts were all bested by the\u00a0new anime adaptation of Spy x Family, which earned almost five times as many votes as the second place winner, Kaguya-sama. Shield Hero's second season rounded out the top three.  RELATED:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary The results shouldn't surprise anyone who has paid attention to the rise of Tatsuya Endo's critically lauded\u00a0espionage comedy: since the series' launch in 2019 as an exclusive title for Shueisha's digital\u00a0\u00a0Shonen Jump+ service, the manga\u00a0has achieved a global circulation of over 12 million copies. Endo's light-hearted take on the spy genre\u00a0has been a hit with critics as well, with praise being directed at its lovable cast of characters and impeccable sense of humor. In 2021, the manga was nominated for an Eisner Award, but ultimately lost to Junji Ito's Remina.  The anime has also garnered attention for its all-star cast crew. The new show is being produced as a collaboration between two of Japan's top animation studios,\u00a0Wit Studio and CloverWorks. Wit is best known for producing the first three seasons of the Attack on Titan anime, as well as last season's critically acclaimed sleeper hit, Ranking of Kings. CloverWorks is the studio behind the breakout show of the winter season,\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling. The show\u00a0is being directed by Kazuhiro Furuhashi, who previously worked on anime\u00a0such as Le Chevalier D'eon\u00a0and Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. RELATED:\u00a0Why Spy x Family's Plot, Premise & Characters Make the Series So Good  The show will star Takuya Eguchi as Loid Forger, a.k.a Twilight, a spy who goes undercover as a family man in order to get closer to his next target. Eguchi previously starred in Haikyuu!! and My Love Story. He is joined by Kakegurui star Saori Hayami, who will voice Yor, Loid's new wife who lives a double life of her own as the world's deadliest assassin. Mob Psycho 100's\u00a0Atsumi Tanezaki rounds out the cast as Anya Forger, Loid and Yor's adopted daughter, who is secretly an escaped government experiment with psychic powers. The Spy x Family anime will premiere its simulcast on Crunchyroll on April 9 \u00a0at 11:30 A.M. EST / 8:30 A.M.\u00a0PST. Endo's original manga is available in English from VIZ Media.

Ali blocked more kicks while Inoki kept to his conservative strategy; he stayed on his back, even while jeered at by the audience and taunted by Ali.

Unlike his father Ali Sr., he's not willing to risk his technique by venturing outside their protection. And yet, while Ali Jr.'s sportsmanly approach to fighting lands him into trouble with more ruthless fighters, his masterful trolling provides a rare instance where Yuujiro Hanma appears at a complete loss.                This palpable confusion is aided not only by Baki's typically intricate and expressive art but also by the incredible voice acting of Akio Otsuka. In the Japanese-language version, Yuujiro's soft, nonplussed \"huh\" -- compared to his usual booming and intimidating voice -- provides a subtle and hilarious touch.   While the high level of attention to esoteric detail is uncommon among anime inspired by martial arts, Baki takes this to the next level. Viewers are expecting an epic battle between accomplished fighters, which they don't receive.

Josh Bell 7 days ago                      Morbius\u2019 Rushed & Muddled Story Won\u2019t Quench Audiences' Thirst  Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be.  Sam Stone Mar 31, 2022                      The Contractor Drops Chris Pine in a Generic Spy Thriller With Little Depth  The Contractor is a standard spy story that makes an effort to engage with deeper themes about the treatment of veterans but falls short.  Josh Bell Mar 30, 2022                      Barbarians Compellingly Tackles Toxic Masculinity But Misses Its Landing  IFC Midnight's Barbarians examines toxic masculinity through the lens of a home invasion thriller that ultimately muddles its messaging.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 30, 2022                      Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out  Night's End brings a lot of intriguing ideas to the surface around the strange powers of isolation but it ultimately doesn't stick its landing.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 29, 2022                      Nitram Offers No Valuable Perspective On a Horrific, Real-Life Tragedy  Director Justin Kurzel's Nitram is somber and pointless. It neither honors victims of a real-life mass shooting nor asks for social change.  Josh Bell Mar 28, 2022                      Morbius' Creepy Motion Poster Is a Terrifying Sight  A terrifying motion poster for Sony and Marvel's Morbius brings the vampiric antihero to life.   Samuel Gelman Mar 22, 2022                      Measure of Revenge\u2019s Muddled Ambitions Lead to a Middling Thriller  Measure of Revenge features some interesting moments and a strong female lead but gets muddled in too many genres and styles to truly land.  Jon Mendelsohn Mar 21, 2022                      REVIEW: Umma Teases a Provocative Story But Overuses Haunted House Tropes  Although Umma opens as a film that's easy to root for -- due to its complex story and unique imagery -- it relies too much on haunted house tropes.  Caitlin Chappell Mar 21, 2022                      Everything Everywhere All At Once Flaunts Michelle Yeoh's Unmatched Star Power  A24's Everything Everywhere All At Once is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, filled with fantastic action set-pieces and loads of heart.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 21, 2022                      Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood Charmingly Melds Nostalgia & Space Fantasy  Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood is a quirky, delightful combination of a realistic \u201860s coming-of-age story with a boy\u2019s space fantasy.  Reuben Baron Mar 21, 2022                      The Lost City Elevates a Standard Plot With Humor & Chemistry  The Lost City's endearing characters, strong performances, and enthusiastic embrace of genre tropes elevate a by-the-numbers plot.  Brandon Zachary Mar 18, 2022                      Windfall Channels the Suspense & Wit of Vintage Thrillers  Full of dry, dark humor, Netflix's Windfall evokes vintage noir and suspense thrillers, with a slight modern strain of social commentary.  Josh Bell Mar 18, 2022                      REVIEW: Ti West's X Serves a Fun & Sensual Bloodbath With a Killer Message  From its opening scene, Ti West's X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 17, 2022                      Cheaper By the Dozen\u2019s Wholesome Family Delivers a Feel-Good Story  Disney+'s Cheaper By the Dozen reimagines the Baker family for a more representative and recognizable story about the power of familial love.  E.L. Meszaros Mar 17, 2022                      Deep Water Surfaces as a Half-Hearted & Murky Erotic Thriller  Deep Water treads along with little to no suspense -- minus its ending -- and centers on a couple with murky character development.

Home Anime Why the Yona of the Dawn Anime Deserves a Second Season    Why the Yona of the Dawn Anime Deserves a Second Season  By Jessie Xu Published 5 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Almost 8 years have passed since Yona of the Dawn was first serialized. It\u2019s time to discuss why it deserves to be renewed for a second installation. \r                  Yona of the Dawn is a reverse harem fantasy anime set in the historical kingdom of Kouka. It is based on the manga of the same name by Mizuho Kusanagi. The anime was decently popular upon its release though it hasn't risen to mainstream popularity like other shoujo anime such as\u00a0Vampire Knight or Fruits Basket. The manga, however, has displayed continuous popularity and success. Yona of the Dawn manga volumes frequently ranks within the Top 10 on Oricon charts upon release. That in itself is quite hard to achieve given the more profitable shounen genres frequently outrank and outsell shoujo mangas.  Despite the popularity of the manga, the anime itself has not been renewed for a second season. That said, the series lends itself to its refreshing take on the reverse harem genre as well as its cast of unique and interesting characters. Here\u2019s a deeper look into why Yona of the Dawn deserves a second season. RELATED:\u00a0Aharen-San's Premiere Episode Echoes Komi Can't Communicate's Shojo-Style Story          The Enthralling Plot and Setting                Yona is the sheltered and charming princess\u00a0of the kingdom of Kouka. She spends most of her days in Hiryuu Castle accompanied by her doting father, her childhood friend, and bodyguard, Son Hak, and her cousin and crush Su-won. But when she\u00a0discovers Su-won murdering her father one night, her entire world is shattered as she experiences the feeling of betrayal for the first time. Forced to flee with Hak into the outside world, Yona must find the strength to reclaim her kingdom once more, despite knowing that it would bring her into conflict with Su-won who she once believed was her friend and ally.\u00a0  Such strength does not come easily though and Yona quickly realizes that she doesn't have the power to protect the people she cares about, let alone have the strength to take back what is hers. This leads her to seek help from the priest who saves them at the bottom of a cliff. He tells Yona an old legend in Kouka that speaks of the Four Dragon Warriors that were tasked to protect the first king of Kouka, King Hiryuu. A prophecy reveals that Yona is the reincarnation of King Hiryuu and\u00a0could\u00a0find strength in the Four Dragon Warriors. The first season spans 24 episodes that follow Yona and Hak, as they search for the Four Dragon Warriors. The season ends just as they find the last dragon warrior, Yellow Dragon Zeno. It's an unfortunate cutoff point as the story in the manga only gets deeper and more intriguing past where the first season covered.  RELATED:\u00a0Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Yona of the Dawn Subverts Reverse Harem Tropes                Unlike traditional reverse harem anime like Amnesia, the men Yona surrounds herself with aren\u2019t presented as potential love interests. Instead, they play the role of her protectors and supporters. As her childhood friend and bodyguard, Hak is one of her closest compatriots. He bears witness to her strength and resilience after everything she ever knew is destroyed before her eyes in one night. He chooses to protect her of his own volition even if he wasn\u2019t obligated to as her bodyguard.  Although the Four Dragon Warriors are bound by legend to protect Yona as she is the reincarnation of King Hiryuu, they don\u2019t all start off willing to be bound to her. However, each of them comes to respect her character and eventually decides to follow her of their own will. Yona herself doesn\u2019t attempt to force them to follow her either, creating an equal balance of respect and free will. This in itself, sets Yona of the Dawn apart from other reverse harem anime. RELATED:\u00a0How Jujutsu Kaisen Justifies One of Shonen Battle Anime's Oldest Tropes          The Cast of Unique Characters                The characters in this series are undoubtedly the highlight of the story. They pull the whole story together and connect motivations to natural consequences that drive the plot forward. The reverse harem genre can often be boring with a lot of overused tropes. Stories in this genre aren\u2019t always the most fleshed out. Most series in this genre follow the trope of \u2018a maiden being surrounded by and attended to by multiple males\u2019. Yona of the Dawn proves that it is possible to not use this trope and does it very well.   Yona is first introduced as a naive and innocent princess shielded from the cruelties of the outside world. At first, it\u2019d be easy to assume that she would easily fall into the \u2018maiden in distress\u2019 role. However, she grows to possess an inordinate strength and maturity as the story progresses. She does not sit back and let the men around her take charge but fights her own battles and becomes a formidable yet compassionate leader. She is a refreshing representation of beauty in strength. Su-won is one of the deepest and most mysterious characters throughout the series. At the start, it is not understood why Su-won decides to betray both of his childhood friends by murdering Yona\u2019s father for the throne. He is often presented as cunning and heartless but the flashbacks to his childhood with Yona and Hak tell a different story. It is eventually revealed that he doesn\u2019t hate Yona nor does he want her dead. In fact, he once protected Yona from being discovered. So why then did he plan such an act of betrayal? It's questions like these that give Su-won much more depth than a traditional villain character. With such compelling characters and a riveting story, it\u2019s definitely prime time to give Yona of the Dawn the second season it deserves.

It\u2019s time to discuss why it deserves to be renewed for a second installation. \r                  Yona of the Dawn is a reverse harem fantasy anime set in the historical kingdom of Kouka. It is based on the manga of the same name by Mizuho Kusanagi. The anime was decently popular upon its release though it hasn't risen to mainstream popularity like other shoujo anime such as\u00a0Vampire Knight or Fruits Basket. The manga, however, has displayed continuous popularity and success. Yona of the Dawn manga volumes frequently ranks within the Top 10 on Oricon charts upon release. That in itself is quite hard to achieve given the more profitable shounen genres frequently outrank and outsell shoujo mangas.  Despite the popularity of the manga, the anime itself has not been renewed for a second season. That said, the series lends itself to its refreshing take on the reverse harem genre as well as its cast of unique and interesting characters. Here\u2019s a deeper look into why Yona of the Dawn deserves a second season. RELATED:\u00a0Aharen-San's Premiere Episode Echoes Komi Can't Communicate's Shojo-Style Story          The Enthralling Plot and Setting                Yona is the sheltered and charming princess\u00a0of the kingdom of Kouka. She spends most of her days in Hiryuu Castle accompanied by her doting father, her childhood friend, and bodyguard, Son Hak, and her cousin and crush Su-won. But when she\u00a0discovers Su-won murdering her father one night, her entire world is shattered as she experiences the feeling of betrayal for the first time. Forced to flee with Hak into the outside world, Yona must find the strength to reclaim her kingdom once more, despite knowing that it would bring her into conflict with Su-won who she once believed was her friend and ally.\u00a0  Such strength does not come easily though and Yona quickly realizes that she doesn't have the power to protect the people she cares about, let alone have the strength to take back what is hers. This leads her to seek help from the priest who saves them at the bottom of a cliff. He tells Yona an old legend in Kouka that speaks of the Four Dragon Warriors that were tasked to protect the first king of Kouka, King Hiryuu. A prophecy reveals that Yona is the reincarnation of King Hiryuu and\u00a0could\u00a0find strength in the Four Dragon Warriors. The first season spans 24 episodes that follow Yona and Hak, as they search for the Four Dragon Warriors. The season ends just as they find the last dragon warrior, Yellow Dragon Zeno. It's an unfortunate cutoff point as the story in the manga only gets deeper and more intriguing past where the first season covered.  RELATED:\u00a0Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Yona of the Dawn Subverts Reverse Harem Tropes                Unlike traditional reverse harem anime like Amnesia, the men Yona surrounds herself with aren\u2019t presented as potential love interests. Instead, they play the role of her protectors and supporters. As her childhood friend and bodyguard, Hak is one of her closest compatriots. He bears witness to her strength and resilience after everything she ever knew is destroyed before her eyes in one night. He chooses to protect her of his own volition even if he wasn\u2019t obligated to as her bodyguard.  Although the Four Dragon Warriors are bound by legend to protect Yona as she is the reincarnation of King Hiryuu, they don\u2019t all start off willing to be bound to her. However, each of them comes to respect her character and eventually decides to follow her of their own will. Yona herself doesn\u2019t attempt to force them to follow her either, creating an equal balance of respect and free will. This in itself, sets Yona of the Dawn apart from other reverse harem anime. RELATED:\u00a0How Jujutsu Kaisen Justifies One of Shonen Battle Anime's Oldest Tropes          The Cast of Unique Characters                The characters in this series are undoubtedly the highlight of the story. They pull the whole story together and connect motivations to natural consequences that drive the plot forward. The reverse harem genre can often be boring with a lot of overused tropes. Stories in this genre aren\u2019t always the most fleshed out. Most series in this genre follow the trope of \u2018a maiden being surrounded by and attended to by multiple males\u2019. Yona of the Dawn proves that it is possible to not use this trope and does it very well.   Yona is first introduced as a naive and innocent princess shielded from the cruelties of the outside world. At first, it\u2019d be easy to assume that she would easily fall into the \u2018maiden in distress\u2019 role. However, she grows to possess an inordinate strength and maturity as the story progresses. She does not sit back and let the men around her take charge but fights her own battles and becomes a formidable yet compassionate leader. She is a refreshing representation of beauty in strength. Su-won is one of the deepest and most mysterious characters throughout the series. At the start, it is not understood why Su-won decides to betray both of his childhood friends by murdering Yona\u2019s father for the throne. He is often presented as cunning and heartless but the flashbacks to his childhood with Yona and Hak tell a different story. It is eventually revealed that he doesn\u2019t hate Yona nor does he want her dead. In fact, he once protected Yona from being discovered. So why then did he plan such an act of betrayal? It's questions like these that give Su-won much more depth than a traditional villain character. With such compelling characters and a riveting story, it\u2019s definitely prime time to give Yona of the Dawn the second season it deserves.

Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media  By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   A new documentary explores the story behind the 20-year old Pok\u00e9mon musical, a now mostly forgotten facet of the popular franchise's history.                 A new documentary shines new light on\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live, a mostly forgotten musical from the video game and anime franchise's initial boom period.  The 68-minute long documentary, entitled Pok\u00e9mon Live: How Pikachu Nearly Took Broadway, was created by\u00a0Jonii Vee and Jamie D. Elms of the retro-gaming focused YouTube channel, Stuff We Play. While live show adaptations of popular kids' cartoons are often seen as shameless cash-ins, the new documentary explores the surprising amount of thought and effort\u00a0that went into\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live and why the play was never released on home video. The play is also notable for being one of the first professional acting jobs for Andrew Rannells, who played Team Rocket's James in the play and would later go on to star in The Book of Mormon and Girls.  RELATED:\u00a0Logan Paul Wore a $5 Million Pok\u00e9mon Card to the Ring for WrestleMania Match    The documentary includes interviews with playwright Michael Slade, actor Jesse Nager, who played the role of an original character named Joe the Deaf Trainer, and actor Patrick Frankfort, who portrayed Professor Oak. The doc\u00a0also features\u00a0rare archival footage of the musical itself, which was never officially released on VHS or DVD. The film reveals several notable bits of trivia\u00a0from the play's production, including a story about how the play's script had to be approved by Ikue Otani, the voice of Pikachu, and how the play's producers tried to create an all-new, original\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon\u00a0for the stage show.  The play itself told a story focused around Ash, Misty and Brock, as they try to stop a new plot from Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni, who has created Mecha Mewtwo, a new version of the original games' most powerful legendary. Mecha Mewtwo is capable of copying any other\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's moves, but still needs to learn how to copy Pikachu's particularly powerful electric attacks before it can be completed. Notably, the play features songs\u00a0about Misty coming to terms with her romantic feelings for Ash, and a song performed by an anthropomorphized representation of the series' electronic\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon encyclopedia, the\u00a0Pok\u00e9dex.

Nintendo and Game Freak previously spent the majority of 2021 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the video game franchise, and recently offered a peak\u00a0into the series' future with the first look at\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, a new set of games which will be released for the Nintendo Switch before the end of 2022.

Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media    Pok\u00e9mon Live! Doc Explores How the Short-Lived Stage Musical Became Lost Media  By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   A new documentary explores the story behind the 20-year old Pok\u00e9mon musical, a now mostly forgotten facet of the popular franchise's history.                 A new documentary shines new light on\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live, a mostly forgotten musical from the video game and anime franchise's initial boom period.  The 68-minute long documentary, entitled Pok\u00e9mon Live: How Pikachu Nearly Took Broadway, was created by\u00a0Jonii Vee and Jamie D. Elms of the retro-gaming focused YouTube channel, Stuff We Play. While live show adaptations of popular kids' cartoons are often seen as shameless cash-ins, the new documentary explores the surprising amount of thought and effort\u00a0that went into\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Live and why the play was never released on home video. The play is also notable for being one of the first professional acting jobs for Andrew Rannells, who played Team Rocket's James in the play and would later go on to star in The Book of Mormon and Girls.  RELATED:\u00a0Logan Paul Wore a $5 Million Pok\u00e9mon Card to the Ring for WrestleMania Match    The documentary includes interviews with playwright Michael Slade, actor Jesse Nager, who played the role of an original character named Joe the Deaf Trainer, and actor Patrick Frankfort, who portrayed Professor Oak. The doc\u00a0also features\u00a0rare archival footage of the musical itself, which was never officially released on VHS or DVD. The film reveals several notable bits of trivia\u00a0from the play's production, including a story about how the play's script had to be approved by Ikue Otani, the voice of Pikachu, and how the play's producers tried to create an all-new, original\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon\u00a0for the stage show.  The play itself told a story focused around Ash, Misty and Brock, as they try to stop a new plot from Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni, who has created Mecha Mewtwo, a new version of the original games' most powerful legendary. Mecha Mewtwo is capable of copying any other\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon's moves, but still needs to learn how to copy Pikachu's particularly powerful electric attacks before it can be completed. Notably, the play features songs\u00a0about Misty coming to terms with her romantic feelings for Ash, and a song performed by an anthropomorphized representation of the series' electronic\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon encyclopedia, the\u00a0Pok\u00e9dex.

Nintendo and Game Freak previously spent the majority of 2021 celebrating the 25th anniversary of the video game franchise, and recently offered a peak\u00a0into the series' future with the first look at\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, a new set of games which will be released for the Nintendo Switch before the end of 2022.

Armed with his iconic helmet and a jetpack, pilot Cliff Secord has gone toe-to-toe with nazis, mad scientists and all manner of outlandish villains. Now, IDW\u00a0is celebrating the hero's 40th anniversary with a new 4-part series written and drawn by Stephen Mooney.\u00a0The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 is a well-crafted first issue that celebrates Cliff's illustrious history.  When Cliff hears rumors of nazi spies lurking in the California woods, he grabs his rocket and leaps into action.\u00a0The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 begins when the aforementioned nazis prove to be tougher than he anticipated. They shoot him down and the hero barely escapes with his life. Much to his girlfriend Betty's delight, this close call is enough to convince Cliff that it's time to put his Rocketeering days behind him. But before Cliff can settle down to a life of leisure, a wealthy inventor makes him an offer he can't refuse, and Cliff enters a transatlantic race that will be more dangerous than he could ever imagine.  Related: IDW's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Annual 2022 #1 Comic Review                Mooney does an excellent job capturing the Rocketeer's voice. The dialogue is ham-fisted and goofy, but it feels natural in the context of the pulpy world Mooney has created. Much like Stevens' original\u00a0Rocketeer, it is easy to imagine each character starring in their own old-timey radio drama. As over-the-top as some elements of\u00a0The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 are, Mooney still makes space to sincerely explore Cliff and Betty's relationship. Her concern for his safety and frustration with their unpredictable lives creates a sincere tension that makes it easy to empathize with both characters. By blending the ridiculous and the old-fashioned with grounded emotional drama, Mooney creates a story that delivers plenty of nostalgia while venturing into new territory.  Much like his writing, Mooney's artwork captures the excitement of the original\u00a0Rocketeer comics while adding a new layer. Panel borders can't contain the excitement of\u00a0The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 as characters often leap out of each panel to create chaotic and dynamic pages. The bombastic nature of the character is reflected in almost every scene. Whether he is dodging bullets or talking to potential employers, Mooney draws Cliff with a sort of devil-may-care attitude that is downright infectious. Len O'Grady's colors are bright and vibrant, but he incorporates a wide array of subtle textures and shades to give this issue a modern look.  Related: Image Comics' Astro City: That Was Then... Special #1                The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 is a fun, action-packed celebration of the classic character. Mooney has a clear understanding of everything that makes Cliff Secord special. Longtime fans of the hero will be delighted by this faithful new representation, and new readers will enjoy the well-crafted adventure story that lays the foundation for a thrilling series.

As over-the-top as some elements of\u00a0The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 are, Mooney still makes space to sincerely explore Cliff and Betty's relationship. Her concern for his safety and frustration with their unpredictable lives creates a sincere tension that makes it easy to empathize with both characters. By blending the ridiculous and the old-fashioned with grounded emotional drama, Mooney creates a story that delivers plenty of nostalgia while venturing into new territory.  Much like his writing, Mooney's artwork captures the excitement of the original\u00a0Rocketeer comics while adding a new layer. Panel borders can't contain the excitement of\u00a0The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 as characters often leap out of each panel to create chaotic and dynamic pages. The bombastic nature of the character is reflected in almost every scene. Whether he is dodging bullets or talking to potential employers, Mooney draws Cliff with a sort of devil-may-care attitude that is downright infectious. Len O'Grady's colors are bright and vibrant, but he incorporates a wide array of subtle textures and shades to give this issue a modern look.  Related: Image Comics' Astro City: That Was Then... Special #1                The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 is a fun, action-packed celebration of the classic character. Mooney has a clear understanding of everything that makes Cliff Secord special. Longtime fans of the hero will be delighted by this faithful new representation, and new readers will enjoy the well-crafted adventure story that lays the foundation for a thrilling series.

Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba's Tanjiro Kamado received a makeover in a new visual for the upcoming theatrical adaptation of the popular Japanese manga series.  As reported by Otakomu, the recent poster featuring Tanjiro in his new outfit was illustrated by\u00a0Koyoharu Gotouge, the creator of\u00a0Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.\u00a0It depicts the young hero in customary Noh clothing that reflects the iconic black-and-green checkered haori he ordinarily dons in the series. RELATED:\u00a0Demon Slayer: Who Is Upper-Rank One?                   The upcoming theatrical performance will be a Noh-Kyogen show \u2014 Noh and Kyogen each respectively being some of the\u00a0oldest forms of classical theater still performed today. In Noh, actors usually wear masks to give dramatic performances featuring\u00a0elements of dance, music and poetry. On the other hand, Kyogen is more comedic through its use of dialogue and is usually staged in between Noh sets.  The Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u00a0Noh-Kyogen show will first be held at the\u00a0Ginza Six Noh theater from\u00a0July 26 to July 31 in a limited 6-day run. It will then be performed at the\u00a0Ohtsuki Noh Theater in\u00a0Osaka from Dec. 9 to Dec. 11. Nomura Mansai II, an\u00a0award-winning Kyogen performer, will be directing and acting in the shows. RELATED:\u00a0Demon Slayer: Why Does Muzan Hate Doma of the Twelve Kizuki? Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba takes place in Taisho-era Japan where dangerous former humans known as \"demons\" roam the planet. Protagonist Tanjiro Kamado witnesses these brutal beasts firsthand when he discovers his entire family slaughtered by a demon. While his younger sister, Nezuko, manages to survive the attack, this comes at the cost of her humanity as she begins to turn into a monster herself. In order to find a way to turn Nezuko back into a human again, Tanjiro joins an organization of warriors known as the Demon Slayer Survey Corps who are dedicated to eliminating the sinister creatures. Tanjiro embarks on an epic quest to battle various foes and track down the demon responsible for his family's demise.  Seasons 1 and 2 of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime are available to stream on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll, along with the film\u00a0Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Mugen Train. It was announced in February 2022 that the popular anime will return for a third season, which will adapt the manga's\u00a0\"Swordsmith Village\" arc.

In Noh, actors usually wear masks to give dramatic performances featuring\u00a0elements of dance, music and poetry. On the other hand, Kyogen is more comedic through its use of dialogue and is usually staged in between Noh sets.  The Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u00a0Noh-Kyogen show will first be held at the\u00a0Ginza Six Noh theater from\u00a0July 26 to July 31 in a limited 6-day run. It will then be performed at the\u00a0Ohtsuki Noh Theater in\u00a0Osaka from Dec. 9 to Dec. 11. Nomura Mansai II, an\u00a0award-winning Kyogen performer, will be directing and acting in the shows. RELATED:\u00a0Demon Slayer: Why Does Muzan Hate Doma of the Twelve Kizuki? Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba takes place in Taisho-era Japan where dangerous former humans known as \"demons\" roam the planet. Protagonist Tanjiro Kamado witnesses these brutal beasts firsthand when he discovers his entire family slaughtered by a demon. While his younger sister, Nezuko, manages to survive the attack, this comes at the cost of her humanity as she begins to turn into a monster herself. In order to find a way to turn Nezuko back into a human again, Tanjiro joins an organization of warriors known as the Demon Slayer Survey Corps who are dedicated to eliminating the sinister creatures. Tanjiro embarks on an epic quest to battle various foes and track down the demon responsible for his family's demise.  Seasons 1 and 2 of the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime are available to stream on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll, along with the film\u00a0Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 The Movie: Mugen Train. It was announced in February 2022 that the popular anime will return for a third season, which will adapt the manga's\u00a0\"Swordsmith Village\" arc.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.  Attack on Titan's Eren Yeager and Historia Reiss have\u00a0had a complicated history together.\u00a0Ever since the former started opening up more in Season 3, the latter started caring for her more as a person and wanting her to live her best life.\u00a0Eren and Historia have grown so close since then that many\u00a0AOT\u00a0fans ship the two of them over\u00a0Eren and Mikasa; there are even rumors that Eren is the real father of Historia's child. As close as these two are, there may be a Yeager with whom Historia shares an even closer connection-- Eren's father, Grisha. Narratively, Historia is destined to share the same grim fate as Grisha Yeager. Eren, however, recognizes this possibility and seeks to rectify it. The parallels become especially apparent during the finale of\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2.  RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                In a flashback in Episode 28 of\u00a0The Final Season,\u00a0\"The Dawn of Humanity,\"\u00a0 Eren talked with Historia about his plan to initiate the Rumbling. Historia was naturally against the plan; she would rather go with the Eldian Military's plan, which involved becoming a Titan, eating Zeke, bearing children, and eventually, being eaten by said children. This option was by no means in her best interest, but at least the rest of the world wouldn't have to die over it. Eren, on the other hand, was opposed to Historia's\u00a0inclination towards\u00a0self-sacrifice. He always wanted to be sure that she could live for herself, which she definitely couldn't do with the Military's plan. He also mentioned that he didn't want to let the cycle of parents being eaten by their children continue. The latter point is where the connection to Grisha can be drawn.  At first, the idea of \"children eating their parents\" seems like a parallel to Ymir's life. She too was\u00a0fed to her children in order for the powers of the Founding Titan to be passed on. This tradition was continued for generations as the Subjects of Ymir became what they are now. However, Eren's comment might revolve around\u00a0something a little more personal. Eren himself was forced to turn into a Titan and devour his own father. When he first realized this, it drove him crazy and left him racked with guilt. It's likely that Eren made his comment about children eating their parents with his own traumatic experience in mind. This would certainly explain why he's against the idea of Historia feeding herself to her own children.  RELATED: Why Do So Many Anime Protagonists Live Without Parents?                In a way, Historia and Grisha are also both accomplices and victims of Eren's plan. While they're both made privy to Eren's true agenda, neither of them\u00a0really wants to go along with it.\u00a0They hate the idea of consigning to a grim fate, but they also realize that Eren's alternative is much worse. Regardless, they are both inevitably coaxed by Eren into complying with his plan. They both have regrets about their decisions to follow Eren, but eventually learn to live with them. While Historia and Grisha don't share the exact same fate, they very well could have.\u00a0Ironically, it's Eren who both causes and prevents the cycle that would connect the two from repeating. If these two victims of fate had somehow met, they would have certainly had\u00a0plenty to talk about together.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.  Attack on Titan's Eren Yeager and Historia Reiss have\u00a0had a complicated history together.\u00a0Ever since the former started opening up more in Season 3, the latter started caring for her more as a person and wanting her to live her best life.\u00a0Eren and Historia have grown so close since then that many\u00a0AOT\u00a0fans ship the two of them over\u00a0Eren and Mikasa; there are even rumors that Eren is the real father of Historia's child. As close as these two are, there may be a Yeager with whom Historia shares an even closer connection-- Eren's father, Grisha. Narratively, Historia is destined to share the same grim fate as Grisha Yeager. Eren, however, recognizes this possibility and seeks to rectify it. The parallels become especially apparent during the finale of\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2.  RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                In a flashback in Episode 28 of\u00a0The Final Season,\u00a0\"The Dawn of Humanity,\"\u00a0 Eren talked with Historia about his plan to initiate the Rumbling. Historia was naturally against the plan; she would rather go with the Eldian Military's plan, which involved becoming a Titan, eating Zeke, bearing children, and eventually, being eaten by said children. This option was by no means in her best interest, but at least the rest of the world wouldn't have to die over it. Eren, on the other hand, was opposed to Historia's\u00a0inclination towards\u00a0self-sacrifice. He always wanted to be sure that she could live for herself, which she definitely couldn't do with the Military's plan. He also mentioned that he didn't want to let the cycle of parents being eaten by their children continue. The latter point is where the connection to Grisha can be drawn.  At first, the idea of \"children eating their parents\" seems like a parallel to Ymir's life. She too was\u00a0fed to her children in order for the powers of the Founding Titan to be passed on. This tradition was continued for generations as the Subjects of Ymir became what they are now. However, Eren's comment might revolve around\u00a0something a little more personal. Eren himself was forced to turn into a Titan and devour his own father. When he first realized this, it drove him crazy and left him racked with guilt. It's likely that Eren made his comment about children eating their parents with his own traumatic experience in mind. This would certainly explain why he's against the idea of Historia feeding herself to her own children.  RELATED: Why Do So Many Anime Protagonists Live Without Parents?                In a way, Historia and Grisha are also both accomplices and victims of Eren's plan. While they're both made privy to Eren's true agenda, neither of them\u00a0really wants to go along with it.\u00a0They hate the idea of consigning to a grim fate, but they also realize that Eren's alternative is much worse. Regardless, they are both inevitably coaxed by Eren into complying with his plan. They both have regrets about their decisions to follow Eren, but eventually learn to live with them. While Historia and Grisha don't share the exact same fate, they very well could have.\u00a0Ironically, it's Eren who both causes and prevents the cycle that would connect the two from repeating. If these two victims of fate had somehow met, they would have certainly had\u00a0plenty to talk about together.

The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart. Joe, the last remaining purple child, confronts his father in a heated battle, while an angry Daredevil savagely beats up\u00a0the disgraced Mayor. Writer Chip Zdarsky mixes that inner conflict with rage and grief, interlacing Daredevil\u2019s self-questioning narration over the events. Often, when drowning in despair, even the heroes can lose their way, but it is worth remembering that saving one's own soul is saving a life as well.  The artwork of Devil's Reign #6 is an orchestra of swashbuckling action, imposing panels, and pensive closeups. Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Elden Ring's stunning open world design and enticing combat can keep players hooked for hundreds of hours. In that time, they can encounter over 100 boss fights, each posing a unique challenge. However, for those only interested in the main story, there are just 12 that need to be defeated; Maliketh, the Black Blade is one of them.  Maliketh is found at the end of the Crumbling Farum Azula Legacy Dungeon, which becomes accessible after defeating the Fire Giant at the Forge of the Giants. He guards the Rune of Death in his initial form as the Beast Clergyman, before transforming into his agile Half-Wolf form as Maliketh, the Black Blade. Although his second phase is very tough, his attacks can be learned and read to effectively dodge and counterattack. RELATED:\u00a0Elden Ring's Fan-Made Seventh Ending Would Have Been Its Bleakest          Breaking Down The Fight Against Maliketh, The Black Blade                Upon entering the battle arena, the Tarnished will be met by the familiar face of the Beast Clergyman. This is Maliketh's alias and acts as the fight's first phase. He wields a short blade for stabbing, swiping and lunge attacks, but his real threat lies in his ranged attacks. The Beast Clergyman can conjure and throw a large boulder or several spiked rocks towards the Tarnished, dealing damage and knocking players back. He will also drag his dagger along the floor, before swiping upwards to launch rocks into the air, which will crash down upon an unsuspecting Tarnished.  Once The Beast Clergyman reaches half-health, a short animation will play out where he transforms into his true self: Maliketh, the Black Blade. Maliketh is an extremely agile Half-Wolf whose weapon can be devastating as it reduces the Tarnished's maximum health, while also sapping HP over time.\u00a0 Maliketh has a variety of attacks, most of which are launched from the air. One sees him leap onto the arena's pillars, before somersaulting off and launching a red wave of holy damage toward the player. He also has a combination attack where he jumps side to side three times, launching\u00a0a wave\u00a0with each jump, before diving towards the Tarnished with a large sweep attack. Another jump attack sees him move straight upwards, before slamming down. He will then jump back out of this landing, dealing damage around him.  Not all of his attacks are launched from the air, however. He has a surprisingly slow sword slam animation and a more agile 360 sword spin and forward slam combination. He can also roar to send out a wave of damage which knocks down the Tarnished and leaves them exposed. RELATED:\u00a0Elden Ring: How to Unlock the Secrets of Sellia          Strategies For Defeating\u00a0Maliketh, The Black Blade                As always, preparation is key. For players who have completed the Volcano Manor questline and been invaded by Recusant Bernahl, the Blasphemous Claw he drops can be very usefulm as it helps deflect the power of Maliketh's Black Blade. The mimic tear\u00a0will also be very useful as it can distract and draw fire from Maliketh. The boss himself is weak to physical attacks so a melee approach will work best. All players should avoid holy attacks as Maliketh has a 98% resistance to them.  The first stage of this boss fight is fairly straightforward. The Beast Clergyman's blade attacks are\u00a0fairly quick so players should dodge them and wait until the rock throw or dagger drag animations begin to move forwards and deal damage. Jump attacks will be particularly effective at breaking poise and opening him up for consecutive hits. Be patient and repeat these steps until he hits half health and transforms into Maliketh, the Black Blade. The second phase of this fight can prove difficult, as Maliketh's supreme agility means players\u00a0have little time to react. Ensure the camera is locked on early, as it's easy to lose the Half-Wolf as he moves quickly around the arena. For healing, players should utilize the arena's pillars to\u00a0block incoming attacks.  RELATED: Elden Ring: How to Defeat the Godskin Duo When Maliketh is airborne, players should simply prepare to read which attack he'll pull off and dodge, as he'll be practically impossible to hit in these moments. For example, as he jumps side to side, count three jumps, dodging the magic waves he sends with each one, before rolling forward to avoid his final lunge. Likewise, when Maliketh jumps straight upwards, he's about to slam straight down so players need to again roll forwards to dodge. As Maliketh recovers from his attacks, players can launch their offense. The boss'\u00a0non-airborne\u00a0attacks should be approached in the same way. Read his animation triggers before dodging sideways for his slam attack or forwards for his 360 blade spin and follow up forward slam attack. Once these animations are complete, move in and attack.\u00a0Players who can learn Maliketh's attack patterns and master these dodge and counterattack timings will soon emerge victoriously.          What You Get For Defeating\u00a0Maliketh, The Black Blade                Players will be rewarded with 220,000 runes and the Remembrance of the Black Blade for defeating Maliketh. The Remembrance can be traded for Maliketh's Black Blade and its attached Destined Death skill or the Black Blade incantation. Both deal holy damage, as well as reducing the opponent's maximum HP and dealing damage over time. After this fight, the Tarnished will be transported to Leyndell, Ashen Capital to continue their journey towards becoming Elden Lord.

Elden Ring's stunning open world design and enticing combat can keep players hooked for hundreds of hours. In that time, they can encounter over 100 boss fights, each posing a unique challenge. However, for those only interested in the main story, there are just 12 that need to be defeated; Maliketh, the Black Blade is one of them.  Maliketh is found at the end of the Crumbling Farum Azula Legacy Dungeon, which becomes accessible after defeating the Fire Giant at the Forge of the Giants. He guards the Rune of Death in his initial form as the Beast Clergyman, before transforming into his agile Half-Wolf form as Maliketh, the Black Blade. Although his second phase is very tough, his attacks can be learned and read to effectively dodge and counterattack. RELATED:\u00a0Elden Ring's Fan-Made Seventh Ending Would Have Been Its Bleakest          Breaking Down The Fight Against Maliketh, The Black Blade                Upon entering the battle arena, the Tarnished will be met by the familiar face of the Beast Clergyman. This is Maliketh's alias and acts as the fight's first phase. He wields a short blade for stabbing, swiping and lunge attacks, but his real threat lies in his ranged attacks. The Beast Clergyman can conjure and throw a large boulder or several spiked rocks towards the Tarnished, dealing damage and knocking players back. He will also drag his dagger along the floor, before swiping upwards to launch rocks into the air, which will crash down upon an unsuspecting Tarnished.  Once The Beast Clergyman reaches half-health, a short animation will play out where he transforms into his true self: Maliketh, the Black Blade. Maliketh is an extremely agile Half-Wolf whose weapon can be devastating as it reduces the Tarnished's maximum health, while also sapping HP over time.\u00a0 Maliketh has a variety of attacks, most of which are launched from the air. One sees him leap onto the arena's pillars, before somersaulting off and launching a red wave of holy damage toward the player. He also has a combination attack where he jumps side to side three times, launching\u00a0a wave\u00a0with each jump, before diving towards the Tarnished with a large sweep attack. Another jump attack sees him move straight upwards, before slamming down. He will then jump back out of this landing, dealing damage around him.  Not all of his attacks are launched from the air, however. He has a surprisingly slow sword slam animation and a more agile 360 sword spin and forward slam combination. He can also roar to send out a wave of damage which knocks down the Tarnished and leaves them exposed. RELATED:\u00a0Elden Ring: How to Unlock the Secrets of Sellia          Strategies For Defeating\u00a0Maliketh, The Black Blade                As always, preparation is key. For players who have completed the Volcano Manor questline and been invaded by Recusant Bernahl, the Blasphemous Claw he drops can be very usefulm as it helps deflect the power of Maliketh's Black Blade. The mimic tear\u00a0will also be very useful as it can distract and draw fire from Maliketh. The boss himself is weak to physical attacks so a melee approach will work best. All players should avoid holy attacks as Maliketh has a 98% resistance to them.  The first stage of this boss fight is fairly straightforward. The Beast Clergyman's blade attacks are\u00a0fairly quick so players should dodge them and wait until the rock throw or dagger drag animations begin to move forwards and deal damage. Jump attacks will be particularly effective at breaking poise and opening him up for consecutive hits. Be patient and repeat these steps until he hits half health and transforms into Maliketh, the Black Blade. The second phase of this fight can prove difficult, as Maliketh's supreme agility means players\u00a0have little time to react. Ensure the camera is locked on early, as it's easy to lose the Half-Wolf as he moves quickly around the arena. For healing, players should utilize the arena's pillars to\u00a0block incoming attacks.  RELATED: Elden Ring: How to Defeat the Godskin Duo When Maliketh is airborne, players should simply prepare to read which attack he'll pull off and dodge, as he'll be practically impossible to hit in these moments. For example, as he jumps side to side, count three jumps, dodging the magic waves he sends with each one, before rolling forward to avoid his final lunge. Likewise, when Maliketh jumps straight upwards, he's about to slam straight down so players need to again roll forwards to dodge. As Maliketh recovers from his attacks, players can launch their offense. The boss'\u00a0non-airborne\u00a0attacks should be approached in the same way. Read his animation triggers before dodging sideways for his slam attack or forwards for his 360 blade spin and follow up forward slam attack. Once these animations are complete, move in and attack.\u00a0Players who can learn Maliketh's attack patterns and master these dodge and counterattack timings will soon emerge victoriously.          What You Get For Defeating\u00a0Maliketh, The Black Blade                Players will be rewarded with 220,000 runes and the Remembrance of the Black Blade for defeating Maliketh. The Remembrance can be traded for Maliketh's Black Blade and its attached Destined Death skill or the Black Blade incantation. Both deal holy damage, as well as reducing the opponent's maximum HP and dealing damage over time. After this fight, the Tarnished will be transported to Leyndell, Ashen Capital to continue their journey towards becoming Elden Lord.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, \"Isn't This Too Close?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll.  The Spring 2022 anime season has arrived, and it features more than a few wholesome anime series, including the brand-new Aharen-san is Indecipherable, which feels like a sister to the ongoing series Komi Can't Communicate. Both anime shows feature a heroine who has trouble speaking to others, but even so, Aharen and Komi have their differences. These slice-of-life heroines are both shy girls who can't easily form friendships or romances with the people around them, but their personalities differ on a fundamental level, which helps set Aharen-san apart. While Komi Shoko is a traditional dandere anime character, Aharen Reina is a twist on the kuudere archetype, and that makes her more compelling than ever.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                In the course of just one episode, Aharen-san is Indecipherable establishes its namesake heroine as not just a kuudere anime character like Nifuji Hirotaka or Sohma Yuki, but one who is made more complex with elements from other -dere types, too. In anime, the -dere archetypes usually describe how a character expresses their affection, with hot-headed tsunderes being prickly and defensive before opening up, kuuderes being aloof and cool-headed before opening up to their chosen love interest and so on. A kuudere in particular simply chooses to not get too involved with the people around them; they are quiet and unexpressive as a matter of preference. This sets them apart from dandere characters like Shoko, who are shy and unassertive to the point of putting themselves down out of excessive modesty or insecurity. It could be said that danderes are less in control of their behavior than kuuderes are, but Aharen Reina blurs the line between these archetypes plus adds a little more.  In the series premiere, Aharen is compelling not just because of her cuteness or the humor of her silent mouth movements, but because she has the assertive nature of a kuudere combined with the insecurities of a dandere, making her something entirely new in modern anime. She is quiet and aloof by choice, as a true kuudere, and she is self-assured when she expresses affection for her new friend, her high school classmate Raido. At the same time, Aharen is insecure about her difficulty speaking to others and being heard, and she has unpleasant memories of her female classmates rejecting her offers of friendship in middle school.  Aharen is \"once bitten, twice shy,\" but she is only insecure about her ability to express herself, not her worthiness as a friend. Self-doubt and self-depreciation are major symptoms of being a dandere, but Aharen lacks those. She knows she can be a good friend to someone, but the barrier of silence stands in her way. For a time, she had chosen to give up trying to overcome that obstacle, but now she's fighting to be heard, and Raido wants to listen. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                Aharen's unusual combination of kuudere and dandere not only sets her apart in the story of Aharen-san is Indecipherable but also allows fans to make general predictions about the future of her character arc, her relationship with Raido and the story's overall tone. Fans can compare her hybrid -dere antics to similar characters such as Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi and certainly Komi Shoko from Komi Can't Communicate, to make some guesses about what she might say or do next.  In Episode 1, for example, Aharen chooses to only stay in Raido's company and direct all her affection toward him, kuudere-style, which suggests that she may act jealously in future episodes if anyone else tries to be Raido's friend. Aharen isn't necessarily a petty or selfish person, but it's clear that this new friendship is an important and symbolic step for her, and she might overreact and shoo away anyone else who wants her to share Raido with them. If so, this will likely happen in a humorous rather than dramatic way, given the series' rom-com tone. It's also possible that Aharen and Raido's relationship will become romantic sooner than expected, especially given Aharen's slight megadere streak, and she might get in over her head. In that case, her dandere side may take over, and she could get flustered and retreat back into her shell, which may take Raido by surprise. Aharen isn't afraid to assertively express her affection to Raido, but once a certain point is reached, she may lose her nerve and rethink her relationship with him. She will have to determine if she has the courage to get serious with Raido and let her kuudere nature triumph over her dandere insecurities.

Here are the best webtoons featuring these themes.                 Solo Leveling\u00a0may not be the first work of fiction that has incorporated video game elements in its narrative, but its success has inspired a lot of similar creations. The webtoon's\u00a0rise to glory is rooted\u00a0in turning a virtually worthless hunter into a peerless, overpowered monarch commanding thousands of shadows. It's a power fantasy that appeals to the audience's urge to dominate a modern world riddled\u00a0with creatures from fantasy stories.  While Solo Leveling's fame has inspired\u00a0similar works that can occasionally\u00a0induce an adrenaline rush, only a few are truly notable. Here are some amazing webtoons that not only feature game elements but are also set in an apocalyptic world. RELATED: Fantasy Manhwa With the Most Intricate & Unique Magic Systems          The Lone Necromancer Focuses On The Greatness Of Necromancy                When Seongwu returns to college after accomplishing his obligatory national service in the military, a mysterious phenomenon forces his entire university to choose a role. Seongwu hesitatingly chooses the necromancer after noticing the numerous stars it has. Almost immediately after, his classroom is attacked by goblins, which he bravely defeats with the little equipment available to him. He then discovers his ability to summon the undead and command them to fight for him -- an ability that will be of great use as various quests\u00a0pit his entire university against monsters.  The Lone Necromancer\u00a0mixes action with horror as it puts its characters in a game set in hard mode. Seongwu and company are literally thrown into chaos with barely any information, and they must struggle with everything they have if they want to survive. Fortunately, their hell greatly resembles RPGs, so they at least have some inkling of what to do next. Seongwu's calm-headedness allows him to bring the most out of his necromancy, resulting in badass action scenes and laudable power-ups. RELATED: What Webtoon and Manhwa to Read After Solo Leveling          Omniscient Reader Gives Livestreaming A Run For Its Money                Kim Dokja is an office worker whose only escape from reality is reading web novels. When his favorite novel, which he has been following for years, comes to an end, he receives a weird message from the author thanking him for being the sole reader and supporter from start to finish. He downloads what seems to be the full manuscript of the web novel -- and then a drastic change starts to occur. The apocalyptic world his web novel is set in suddenly starts overlapping with his reality. Omniscient Reader\u00a0may have realized a web novel, but it features a slew of game mechanics. This webtoon features numerous higher beings known as Constellations who generously spend on their Incarnations. The characters are also rewarded based on their actions, and these rewards are often supernatural abilities or useful aids. They\u00a0can also be awarded coins, which they can spend on a handy shop that sells various game-changing equipment.\u00a0One of the most efficient ways of earning these coins is to accomplish the missions and survive their hellish events.  RELATED: The Best Isekai Told From the 'Villain's' Perspective          The Earth's Chosen Savior Questions The Meaning Of The Word 'Savior'                After everything humanity has done to its beloved planet, Earth is finally meeting\u00a0its\u00a0end. However, the planet sends a message to all its inhabitants: it will be dying within 42 days, but there are a chosen few who can save it from its demise. However, these Saviors' mission is not as simple as it seems. They must not only fight ghastly monsters but also eliminate other people to maintain their Earth-saving powers. Putting a dark twist on being a savior,\u00a0The Earth's Chosen Savior\u00a0highlights the benefits of PK-ing, or player killing. Even though defeating the monsters can yield a certain amount of power, it's nowhere near enough to accomplish what the Saviors are tasked to do. That being said, these supposed Saviors are the most terrifying entities in this apocalyptic webtoon.

Here are the best webtoons featuring these themes.                 Solo Leveling\u00a0may not be the first work of fiction that has incorporated video game elements in its narrative, but its success has inspired a lot of similar creations. The webtoon's\u00a0rise to glory is rooted\u00a0in turning a virtually worthless hunter into a peerless, overpowered monarch commanding thousands of shadows. It's a power fantasy that appeals to the audience's urge to dominate a modern world riddled\u00a0with creatures from fantasy stories.  While Solo Leveling's fame has inspired\u00a0similar works that can occasionally\u00a0induce an adrenaline rush, only a few are truly notable. Here are some amazing webtoons that not only feature game elements but are also set in an apocalyptic world. RELATED: Fantasy Manhwa With the Most Intricate & Unique Magic Systems          The Lone Necromancer Focuses On The Greatness Of Necromancy                When Seongwu returns to college after accomplishing his obligatory national service in the military, a mysterious phenomenon forces his entire university to choose a role. Seongwu hesitatingly chooses the necromancer after noticing the numerous stars it has. Almost immediately after, his classroom is attacked by goblins, which he bravely defeats with the little equipment available to him. He then discovers his ability to summon the undead and command them to fight for him -- an ability that will be of great use as various quests\u00a0pit his entire university against monsters.  The Lone Necromancer\u00a0mixes action with horror as it puts its characters in a game set in hard mode. Seongwu and company are literally thrown into chaos with barely any information, and they must struggle with everything they have if they want to survive. Fortunately, their hell greatly resembles RPGs, so they at least have some inkling of what to do next. Seongwu's calm-headedness allows him to bring the most out of his necromancy, resulting in badass action scenes and laudable power-ups. RELATED: What Webtoon and Manhwa to Read After Solo Leveling          Omniscient Reader Gives Livestreaming A Run For Its Money                Kim Dokja is an office worker whose only escape from reality is reading web novels. When his favorite novel, which he has been following for years, comes to an end, he receives a weird message from the author thanking him for being the sole reader and supporter from start to finish. He downloads what seems to be the full manuscript of the web novel -- and then a drastic change starts to occur. The apocalyptic world his web novel is set in suddenly starts overlapping with his reality. Omniscient Reader\u00a0may have realized a web novel, but it features a slew of game mechanics. This webtoon features numerous higher beings known as Constellations who generously spend on their Incarnations. The characters are also rewarded based on their actions, and these rewards are often supernatural abilities or useful aids. They\u00a0can also be awarded coins, which they can spend on a handy shop that sells various game-changing equipment.\u00a0One of the most efficient ways of earning these coins is to accomplish the missions and survive their hellish events.  RELATED: The Best Isekai Told From the 'Villain's' Perspective          The Earth's Chosen Savior Questions The Meaning Of The Word 'Savior'                After everything humanity has done to its beloved planet, Earth is finally meeting\u00a0its\u00a0end. However, the planet sends a message to all its inhabitants: it will be dying within 42 days, but there are a chosen few who can save it from its demise. However, these Saviors' mission is not as simple as it seems. They must not only fight ghastly monsters but also eliminate other people to maintain their Earth-saving powers. Putting a dark twist on being a savior,\u00a0The Earth's Chosen Savior\u00a0highlights the benefits of PK-ing, or player killing. Even though defeating the monsters can yield a certain amount of power, it's nowhere near enough to accomplish what the Saviors are tasked to do. That being said, these supposed Saviors are the most terrifying entities in this apocalyptic webtoon.

A recently discovered promotional banner for\u00a0Thor: Love and Thunder\u00a0reveals fans' best look yet at Thor and Jane Foster's new costumes.  The image, posted to Twitter by @lovethundernews, features the film's electrifying protagonists as they seemingly fly through space. Thor can be seen wielding Stormbreaker while Jane, adorned in her Asgardian armor, brandishes the reforged Mjolnir. While previously unveiled toys and LEGO sets have hinted that the character's costumes would undergo a major redesign, the banner is the clearest look yet at their new outfits. Thor's armor is predominately blue with gold accents while Jane's is largely silver with streaks of red. Related:\u00a0Chris Hemsworth Celebrates His Sons' Birthday with Thor Cosplay Fit for the Gods     The purpose of the banner is currently unknown but some fans suspect that it will serve as the basis for a popcorn tub that could be offered to audiences who see the film in theaters. Some speculate that these images will act as variants as another recent leak revealed a different set of popcorn containers that bear the protagonists in a similar pose alongside close-ups of their respective weapons. While\u00a0Thor: Love and Thunder\u00a0is only months from launch, Marvel Studios has yet to drop the film's first trailer. While some fans have expressed concerns over the lack of formal marketing material, some believe that the trailer may not be too far off. A photo from the film's press tour was recently highlighted as a potential hint for when audiences can expect to see their first glimpse at the next\u00a0Thor\u00a0movie. The image features stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson sitting alongside director Taika Waititi, all of whom are holding up their hands in differing patterns. Some fans have taken this to mean that a trailer will finally arrive on April 11.

By Marc York Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Chapter 328 of Black Clover seems to suggest that Asta will finally get to know his mother.                  WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Black Clover Chapter 328, by Y\u016bki Tabata, available in English from Viz Media.  For most of Black Clover, Asta's mother Licita has remained a mystery to the boy, because she left him at the Hage Village\u00a0church when he was a baby. He grew up healthy, but it nevertheless would have been nice if he'd gotten to know his mom, at least a little. However, that gap in Asta's knowledge might be filled in the near future. Chapter 328 of the manga, \"Always,\" puts a\u00a0good amount of focus on Licita. For how much she's emphasized, it wouldn't be surprising if Asta\u00a0finally found out about her. Here's a look at what happened, how it could lead to Asta learning the truth, and what it could mean for the future of\u00a0Black Clover.  RELATED:\u00a0Black Clover Movie Teaser Trailer Reveals 2023 Premiere Window                In actuality, the primary focus of this chapter was the finale of the long\u00a0battle between Asta and Liebe and Lucifero. With only seconds of their Devil Union left, Asta and Liebe had to finish off this ruler of the underworld quickly. In classic shonen fashion, such an\u00a0epic climax caused the characters to think about everything that led to it. In this case, Liebe apparently flashed back to his time with Licita. As the two watch the sunset over Hage's demon skeleton, Licita tells the young demon about how she had to leave her son\u00a0lest her ability drains him of his life. She insists that despite failing Asta as a mom, she will always love him.  It's possible that Asta can see Liebe's memories of Licita since they're sharing a body through Devil Union. If this is the case, then he might be able to tell who she is either from the context clues or the uncanny resemblance to himself. Even if Asta can't see these memories, Liebe will have to share what he knows eventually. Lucifero was also able to pick up on the connection through different means. In his case, he recognized the look in Asta's eyes; to him, it was like that of Licita, whom he is responsible for killing. He almost commented on this out loud, saying \"that blasted, worthless woman. The one who got in my way. She's your-!!!\" However, Asta cut him off with the business end of his Demon-Slasher Katana.  RELATED: Black Clover, Kageki Shojo Headline Funimation's Home Video Lineup It's likely that Asta and Liebe heard what Lucifero was trying to say. They responded to his line by saying \"you're the one who's worthless,\" which means they were definitely listening to him. While the word \"mother\" never left the demon lord's mouth, either Asta or Liebe could easily fill in the blank.                While learning about his mother won't necessarily affect him, Asta should at least have his curiosity piqued by the opportunity. Assuming Asta does, in fact, find out about Licita, it could change a lot about his dynamic with Liebe.\u00a0 It could further strengthen the bond between the two boys; they're already good friends, but\u00a0realizing that they shared a mother could cause them to grow as close as siblings, closer than even Asta and Yuno. It might even lead the two of them to find a more refined form of Devil Union; if Black Clover\u00a0really does continue after this arc, they'll probably need it. In any case, Asta figuring out the truth can only benefit the story.  Whether Asta found out about his mother or not in this chapter, the door has been left open. Should he end up walking through it, it gives both him and Liebe a good chance to develop as both characters and as siblings. As long as the two of them remain connected, the topic will have to come up sooner or later. Everyone deserves to know about their mother, especially anime protagonists; it worked out for Naruto, so it should definitely do wonders for Asta.

Black Clover: Will Asta Finally Learn Who His Mom Is?  By Marc York Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Chapter 328 of Black Clover seems to suggest that Asta will finally get to know his mother.                  WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Black Clover Chapter 328, by Y\u016bki Tabata, available in English from Viz Media.  For most of Black Clover, Asta's mother Licita has remained a mystery to the boy, because she left him at the Hage Village\u00a0church when he was a baby. He grew up healthy, but it nevertheless would have been nice if he'd gotten to know his mom, at least a little. However, that gap in Asta's knowledge might be filled in the near future. Chapter 328 of the manga, \"Always,\" puts a\u00a0good amount of focus on Licita. For how much she's emphasized, it wouldn't be surprising if Asta\u00a0finally found out about her. Here's a look at what happened, how it could lead to Asta learning the truth, and what it could mean for the future of\u00a0Black Clover.  RELATED:\u00a0Black Clover Movie Teaser Trailer Reveals 2023 Premiere Window                In actuality, the primary focus of this chapter was the finale of the long\u00a0battle between Asta and Liebe and Lucifero. With only seconds of their Devil Union left, Asta and Liebe had to finish off this ruler of the underworld quickly. In classic shonen fashion, such an\u00a0epic climax caused the characters to think about everything that led to it. In this case, Liebe apparently flashed back to his time with Licita. As the two watch the sunset over Hage's demon skeleton, Licita tells the young demon about how she had to leave her son\u00a0lest her ability drains him of his life. She insists that despite failing Asta as a mom, she will always love him.  It's possible that Asta can see Liebe's memories of Licita since they're sharing a body through Devil Union. If this is the case, then he might be able to tell who she is either from the context clues or the uncanny resemblance to himself. Even if Asta can't see these memories, Liebe will have to share what he knows eventually. Lucifero was also able to pick up on the connection through different means. In his case, he recognized the look in Asta's eyes; to him, it was like that of Licita, whom he is responsible for killing. He almost commented on this out loud, saying \"that blasted, worthless woman. The one who got in my way. She's your-!!!\" However, Asta cut him off with the business end of his Demon-Slasher Katana.  RELATED: Black Clover, Kageki Shojo Headline Funimation's Home Video Lineup It's likely that Asta and Liebe heard what Lucifero was trying to say. They responded to his line by saying \"you're the one who's worthless,\" which means they were definitely listening to him. While the word \"mother\" never left the demon lord's mouth, either Asta or Liebe could easily fill in the blank.                While learning about his mother won't necessarily affect him, Asta should at least have his curiosity piqued by the opportunity. Assuming Asta does, in fact, find out about Licita, it could change a lot about his dynamic with Liebe.\u00a0 It could further strengthen the bond between the two boys; they're already good friends, but\u00a0realizing that they shared a mother could cause them to grow as close as siblings, closer than even Asta and Yuno. It might even lead the two of them to find a more refined form of Devil Union; if Black Clover\u00a0really does continue after this arc, they'll probably need it. In any case, Asta figuring out the truth can only benefit the story.  Whether Asta found out about his mother or not in this chapter, the door has been left open. Should he end up walking through it, it gives both him and Liebe a good chance to develop as both characters and as siblings. As long as the two of them remain connected, the topic will have to come up sooner or later. Everyone deserves to know about their mother, especially anime protagonists; it worked out for Naruto, so it should definitely do wonders for Asta.

Here's where to find them in Fast-Flowing Waterworks.                 Kirby and the Forgotten Land, a wonderful foray into the first fully 3D world in the series, has classic Kirby gameplay qualities\u00a0along with\u00a0some new twists. With a larger world and open levels to explore, there is a lot for players to experiment with when using abilities as well as plenty of places to hide different collectibles, the most important ones being the\u00a0kidnapped Waddle Dees. These foes-turned-friends are hidden all across the Forgotten Land and play an important role in forging ahead.  Waddle Dees set up camp in the new world by building Waddle Dee Town, a nice little spot where Kirby\u00a0can select abilities, power them up, watch cutscenes and receive special code gifts like the ones gained from the demo.\u00a0The Waddle Dees will\u00a0even build Kirby a home, making the game one of the rare times where players actually get to go into Kirby's house. To get it, players will need to find some Waddle Dees first. Three of them can be unlocked just for completing this next level, Fast-Flowing Waterworks. RELATED: Kirby and the Forgotten Land: How to Find Every Waddle Dee in Rocky Rollin' Road          How To Find The Hidden Waddle Dees                There are five hidden Waddle Dees in this level. The first is easy to find, as it's in plain sight in a pipe part that can be found while traveling down the flow of water at the beginning of the level. The second Waddle Dee is just after the big enemy brawl in a hidden area. Just north of a steel wall is a bomb block on the right\u00a0that will blow it up to reveal\u00a0a hidden passage. Players should head through and complete the timed boat maze by going right, left, then down the middle. After Kirby\u00a0defeats the crocs at the end, the Waddle Dee will be waiting. The third and fourth Waddle Dees are located in the third area, practically next to each other, and require the Ice ability to reach. Players need to use the second set of stairs to press the switch in front of the gates where the Waddle Dees are kept. This will unlock the first door and Waddle Dee three.\u00a0Kirby's Ice ability\u00a0can be used to remove the flaming stumps on the bridge to the right. Players can then retrieve the third set of stairs and use it to trigger the two switches to the right of the gates.\u00a0This will trigger the second one and reveal the fourth Waddle Dee.  The fifth and last\u00a0Waddle Dee is located in the fourth area, floating over the second whirlpool. On the right side of the room, there is a switch hiding atop a platform. Hitting it will make new platforms appear, creating an easy path to the final Waddle Dee. RELATED: Kirby and the Forgotten Land: How to Find Every Waddle Dee in Scale the Cement Summit          How To Find The Tins of Fish\u00a0& Unlock An Additional Waddle Dee                In Fast-Flowing Waterworks, there are three Tins of Fish for Kirby to find and eat. Doing so\u00a0will unlock\u00a0an additional\u00a0Waddle Dee. The first is near the door at the end of the first area. Just hop onto the fuse boxes on the right wall to trigger a shiny spot. Stand in it to make the Tin appear on the left.  The second Tin of Fish is near the third and fourth Waddle Dees and requires the Ice ability to reach. On the bridge leading to them is an area with a button and a fiery alcove. Players should place the second set of stairs to climb to the alcove and use the Ice ability to reveal the Tin of Fish. The last Tin of Fish is sneakily floating around the first whirlpool encountered in area four.

To do this,\u00a0players\u00a0need to pay attention to Kirby's footing and stay on the iron bridge.\u00a0Players should grab the Bomb ability for range and toss them at the enemies\u00a0that spawn. The bombs will float in water too deep for enemies to run into.          How To Find The Golden Fish                Another mission that players must complete is to find the Golden Fish. Located in the third room with the second set of stairs, the Golden Fish can be found just to the left, in one of the schools of fish that can be seen in still waters. All Kirby needs to do is\u00a0touch\u00a0the fish before it swims off. Once all the level's missions are complete, the remaining three Waddle Dees will be unlocked.

Hitting it will make new platforms appear, creating an easy path to the final Waddle Dee.

Doing so\u00a0will unlock\u00a0an additional\u00a0Waddle Dee. The first is near the door at the end of the first area. Just hop onto the fuse boxes on the right wall to trigger a shiny spot. Stand in it to make the Tin appear on the left.  The second Tin of Fish is near the third and fourth Waddle Dees and requires the Ice ability to reach. On the bridge leading to them is an area with a button and a fiery alcove. Players should place the second set of stairs to climb to the alcove and use the Ice ability to reveal the Tin of Fish. The last Tin of Fish is sneakily floating around the first whirlpool encountered in area four. RELATED:\u00a0Kirby and the Forgotten Land: How to Find Every Waddle Dee in Welcome to Wondaria          How to Win the Battle Without Falling into the Water                To complete the\u00a0level and unlock the remaining Waddle Dees, players need to avoid falling into the water. To do this,\u00a0players\u00a0need to pay attention to Kirby's footing and stay on the iron bridge.\u00a0Players should grab the Bomb ability for range and toss them at the enemies\u00a0that spawn. The bombs will float in water too deep for enemies to run into.          How To Find The Golden Fish                Another mission that players must complete is to find the Golden Fish. Located in the third room with the second set of stairs, the Golden Fish can be found just to the left, in one of the schools of fish that can be seen in still waters. All Kirby needs to do is\u00a0touch\u00a0the fish before it swims off. Once all the level's missions are complete, the remaining three Waddle Dees will be unlocked.

Marvel's X-Men: Red #1   Artist  Stefano Caselli    Colorist  Federico Blee    Cover Artist  Matthew Wilson, Russell Dauterman    Letterer  Ariana Maher    Price  4.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Al Ewing      X-Men: Red #1 continues the massive Destiny of X roll-out as the cosmic reach of X-Men extends even further. Marvel mainstays and collaborators on S.W.O.R.D., writer Al Ewing and artist Stefano Caselli are reuniting for this ambitious new project, with colors by Federico Blee and letters by Ariana Maher. After\u00a0terraforming Mars, Arakki mutants are gradually inhabiting their recently claimed homeworld. However, with a new planet comes old problems that form the basis of\u00a0X-Men: Red.  The first issue of X-Men: Red naturally falls into three distinct parts, each following an iconic mutant through personal transformation and upheaval on the newly dubbed planet Arakko. Storm wrestles with her status as the Queen of Mars. Faced with a critical juncture in the future of Arakko and external pressure from Earth, she is forced to decide what kind of ruler she will be. Elsewhere on Arakko, Magneto searches for solitude to live out his twilight years. Finally, Sunspot has opened a bar, drifting through life and wondering about his chances of bringing disco to space. With the appearance of some unexpected characters, Sunspot realizes that old tensions, both personal and political, are more dangerous than ever on a new planet. All three characters converge for the conclusion, setting the foundations of a new schism in mutant-kind that might tear apart the fragile peace on Arakko for good.  RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: X-Men Red Gets Stunning Variants From Peach Momoko and More                Ewing proves his mettle as a veteran writer in X-Men: Red #1, weaving together a complex story with countless moving parts without the narrative feeling mechanical. In fact, the plot feels extremely character-driven in an organic way, with each depiction feeling well-considered and authentic. X-Men: Red #1\u00a0is tightly intertwined with the current X-Men continuity, meaning that the referenced past storylines and character beats are largely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't kept up with recent titles. Even the most eagle-eyed hunters of context clues will struggle to keep abreast without an idea of the developments of last year's inaugural Hellfire Gala.\u00a0This\u00a0is not a weakness of the writing per se, but an undeniable factor in how much any given reader will enjoy the issue.  Caselli's art is expressive and utterly gorgeous, handling dramatic Martian scenery and subtle dialogue with equally high standards of execution. The action scenes are visually dynamic and imbued with a tautness that drives the momentum of the sequence and also gives resonance to the emotions behind the violence. Caselli has a beautiful style for capturing faces and expressions, which beyond being very technically impressive delivers some deeply emotive panels that reinforce the character development and its poignancy. RELATED:\u00a0Writer of Upcoming X-Men Red Series Drops Mysterious Spotify Playlist  Blee's fantastic colors are what really sell the comic as an extraterrestrial adventure, with the titular red dominating the pages. The sky shifts miasmically between a dusty brick color and something closer to magenta, and even indoors a ruddy glow persists. Another byproduct, besides the undeniable atmosphere, is that all flashbacks or scenes not set on Arakko lack that flavor, giving it a distinctive and individual identity. The lettering by Maher is solidly impressive throughout, including some excellent sound effects amid action sequences that almost merge the lettering with the art itself. The combination is visually stunning and keeps the reader immersed in the action.  X-Men: Red #1 is a gripping and ground-breaking debut that does an excellent job of drawing together disparate threads of the sprawling X-Men canon to springboard into an exciting new chapter. The bold finale is perfectly crafted to leave the reader eager for more. Now that all the pieces on the board have been arranged, the next issue can't come soon enough.

Marvel's X-Men: Red #1   Artist  Stefano Caselli    Colorist  Federico Blee    Cover Artist  Matthew Wilson, Russell Dauterman    Letterer  Ariana Maher    Price  4.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Al Ewing      X-Men: Red #1 continues the massive Destiny of X roll-out as the cosmic reach of X-Men extends even further. Marvel mainstays and collaborators on S.W.O.R.D., writer Al Ewing and artist Stefano Caselli are reuniting for this ambitious new project, with colors by Federico Blee and letters by Ariana Maher. After\u00a0terraforming Mars, Arakki mutants are gradually inhabiting their recently claimed homeworld. However, with a new planet comes old problems that form the basis of\u00a0X-Men: Red.  The first issue of X-Men: Red naturally falls into three distinct parts, each following an iconic mutant through personal transformation and upheaval on the newly dubbed planet Arakko. Storm wrestles with her status as the Queen of Mars. Faced with a critical juncture in the future of Arakko and external pressure from Earth, she is forced to decide what kind of ruler she will be. Elsewhere on Arakko, Magneto searches for solitude to live out his twilight years. Finally, Sunspot has opened a bar, drifting through life and wondering about his chances of bringing disco to space. With the appearance of some unexpected characters, Sunspot realizes that old tensions, both personal and political, are more dangerous than ever on a new planet. All three characters converge for the conclusion, setting the foundations of a new schism in mutant-kind that might tear apart the fragile peace on Arakko for good.  RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: X-Men Red Gets Stunning Variants From Peach Momoko and More                Ewing proves his mettle as a veteran writer in X-Men: Red #1, weaving together a complex story with countless moving parts without the narrative feeling mechanical. In fact, the plot feels extremely character-driven in an organic way, with each depiction feeling well-considered and authentic. X-Men: Red #1\u00a0is tightly intertwined with the current X-Men continuity, meaning that the referenced past storylines and character beats are largely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't kept up with recent titles. Even the most eagle-eyed hunters of context clues will struggle to keep abreast without an idea of the developments of last year's inaugural Hellfire Gala.\u00a0This\u00a0is not a weakness of the writing per se, but an undeniable factor in how much any given reader will enjoy the issue.  Caselli's art is expressive and utterly gorgeous, handling dramatic Martian scenery and subtle dialogue with equally high standards of execution. The action scenes are visually dynamic and imbued with a tautness that drives the momentum of the sequence and also gives resonance to the emotions behind the violence. Caselli has a beautiful style for capturing faces and expressions, which beyond being very technically impressive delivers some deeply emotive panels that reinforce the character development and its poignancy. RELATED:\u00a0Writer of Upcoming X-Men Red Series Drops Mysterious Spotify Playlist  Blee's fantastic colors are what really sell the comic as an extraterrestrial adventure, with the titular red dominating the pages. The sky shifts miasmically between a dusty brick color and something closer to magenta, and even indoors a ruddy glow persists. Another byproduct, besides the undeniable atmosphere, is that all flashbacks or scenes not set on Arakko lack that flavor, giving it a distinctive and individual identity. The lettering by Maher is solidly impressive throughout, including some excellent sound effects amid action sequences that almost merge the lettering with the art itself. The combination is visually stunning and keeps the reader immersed in the action.  X-Men: Red #1 is a gripping and ground-breaking debut that does an excellent job of drawing together disparate threads of the sprawling X-Men canon to springboard into an exciting new chapter. The bold finale is perfectly crafted to leave the reader eager for more. Now that all the pieces on the board have been arranged, the next issue can't come soon enough.

Here's why Brotherhood's Scar would dominate his old counterpart.                 The 2003 anime version of\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist is drastically and dramatically different from the more faithful 2009 manga adaption,\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. These differences resulted\u00a0from\u00a0the manga's ongoing status at the time of the\u00a0first\u00a0series, resulting in an anime-original storyline for the latter half of the plot.  One of the biggest differences is the anti-hero Scar and how he grows throughout the respective series. By the end of FMAB, it's clear that Scar has transformed into a man\u00a0who surpasses his old self in every way. Here's how. RELATED: Why Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa Had the Worst Possible Ending                In Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003, Scar\u2019s brother attempted to bring back his deceased love using the forbidden art of human transmutation. This act failed, however, and created the homunculus known as Lust which would serve to be the impetus for the brother\u2019s banishment. Later on during\u00a0the Ishvalan Civil War\u00a0he sought the Grand Arcanum, an ancient forbidden alchemy that was taught to Scar\u2019s brother by the Ishvalan Exile. By drawing a series of transmutation circles on one\u2019s body, they are able to take the souls of either the deceased or living and use them to create a Philosopher\u2019s Stone inside themselves.  Unlike alchemists who go through three distinct processes to transmute objects, Scar is unique in that he chooses to only use the first two processes. The three processes of alchemy are 1) understanding of the molecular composition, 2) destruction of the material and 3) reconstruction into a new form. Ishvalans are philosophically opposed to the third process, believing it is heretical to make god\u2019s creations better than they already were. RELATED:\u00a0How Tall Is Fullmetal Alchemist's Edward Elric - and How Did He Grow Taller?                When Scar and his brother try to escape the war, State Alchemist Kimblee intercepts\u00a0them, giving Scar his eponymous injury and blowing off his right arm. Before dying,\u00a0his brother attaches his own arm, tattooed with the Grand Arcanum, onto Scar and tells him to continue living. This procedure saved Scar\u2019s life and gifted him with his most dangerous weapon: an arm that can perform the first two processes of alchemic transmutation. With this newfound power of destruction, Scar began a campaign as the \u201cwrath of God\u201d to massacre Amestrian soldiers and State Alchemists by destroying their organs with his right hand.  Scar later manipulates the people of Liore into helping him create a giant transmutation circle throughout their city. In a final battle against Alphonse and Scar at the end of 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist, Kimblee uses the last of his strength to transmute Alphonse into a living bomb while Scar is fatally shot by an Amestrian soldier. Recognizing his imminent demise, Scar uses the last of his power to complete the city-wide transmutation circle he drew and create a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse to save him. This circle ended up killing hundreds if not thousands of Amestrian soldiers and alchemists, and would serve to horrify the man Scar became in Brotherhood.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Teases New Movie for Series' 20th Anniversary                In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Scar lost his arm in an almost identical way. State Alchemist Kimblee ambushed a group of Ishvalans and blew them up with his explosive alchemy.\u00a0Scar was left in shock from blood loss due to losing his right arm in the blast, so his brother attached his own arm to young Scar. This gave\u00a0him the ability to access the first two processes of alchemy merely by touching it. As Ed notes later in the series, whether Scar chooses to admit it or not, he is a very skilled alchemist and\u00a0highly\u00a0intelligent to be able to recognize the materials of what he transmutes at a glance.  Like his 2003 counterpart, Scar went on a quest of vengeance to kill State Alchemists and Amestrian soldiers. An important difference, however, is that\u00a0he is not trapping their souls anymore in FMAB. This likewise signals a\u00a0change in character,\u00a0owing to his more compassionate portrayal. As Scar's quest goes on and he begins killing high-ranking military offers, Ed and Al confront him\u00a0over his actions. Winry catches up to the three and learns that Scar was the one who killed her parents, leading her to hold him at gunpoint. Ed leaps over Scar in front of Winry, shielding her from\u00a0his grasp. Reminded of his brother's courage in shielding him\u00a0when Kimblee attacked, Scar began to have a change of heart over the extremity of his mission.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer                 Scar later continues his journey with Yoki, Marcoh and\u00a0Mei Chang.\u00a0This part of his character arc in FMAB is notable for his increasingly relaxed demeanor and decrease in\u00a0acts of violence against random Amestrian soldiers. After\u00a0fighting with Ed and Al in the North\u00a0City,\u00a0Scar is wounded and captured. He is bandaged by Winry and introduced to Major Miles, a fellow Ishvalan who is trying to change the military's perception of Ishvalans from the inside. Scar is\u00a0visibly touched by speaking to Miles and\u00a0begins to truly\u00a0scrutinize\u00a0whether\u00a0his actions are for the greater good.  All of Scar's character growth would\u00a0pay dividends in\u00a0his ultimate fight\u00a0against King Bradley. After stabbing and pinning Scar's right arm to the ground,\u00a0the King attempts to finish\u00a0him off by thrusting his sword into Scar as he is lying on his back unarmed. If this were\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003's Scar, he would've died right here. However, Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0managed to turn the tides by surprising both Bradley and the audience. In the interim leading up to the Promised Day, Scar tattooed his left arm with the symbols of\u00a0all three alchemic processes. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                 This allowed\u00a0Scar to transmute the ground below him into a jagged mass of rocks that served to pierce Bradley's dominant right arm and throw him completely off guard. Instead of relying on the vast network of Philosopher's Stones that ran underground -- as they had unknowingly been doing since Amestria's inception -- Scar, using his knowledge of alkahestry, activates a reversed transmutation circle to allow alchemists to tap into the power of tectonics. If the two Scars were to ever fight, it would result in\u00a0Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0coming out on top using a lethal combination of his destructive and constructive alchemy.\u00a0The emotional growth Scar undergoes in FMAB\u00a0would make him pity the man he was in the 2003 adaptation. Brotherhood's Scar would even compare his old self to Bradley, likely saying they are both using giant human transmutation circles for petty reasons.  Using the wisdom and patience acquired from being an Ishvalan monk, Fullmetal Alchemist:\u00a0Brotherhood's Scar would not only incapacitate his old self but likely also attempt to reason with him. If words fail, he\u00a0still has the unique ability to use his left arm to transmute the surroundings of his old self, incapacitating\u00a0his opponent and his arm, then\u00a0use his own right arm\u00a0for the finishing blow.

Here's why Brotherhood's Scar would dominate his old counterpart.                 The 2003 anime version of\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist is drastically and dramatically different from the more faithful 2009 manga adaption,\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. These differences resulted\u00a0from\u00a0the manga's ongoing status at the time of the\u00a0first\u00a0series, resulting in an anime-original storyline for the latter half of the plot.  One of the biggest differences is the anti-hero Scar and how he grows throughout the respective series. By the end of FMAB, it's clear that Scar has transformed into a man\u00a0who surpasses his old self in every way. Here's how. RELATED: Why Fullmetal Alchemist: Conqueror of Shamballa Had the Worst Possible Ending                In Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003, Scar\u2019s brother attempted to bring back his deceased love using the forbidden art of human transmutation. This act failed, however, and created the homunculus known as Lust which would serve to be the impetus for the brother\u2019s banishment. Later on during\u00a0the Ishvalan Civil War\u00a0he sought the Grand Arcanum, an ancient forbidden alchemy that was taught to Scar\u2019s brother by the Ishvalan Exile. By drawing a series of transmutation circles on one\u2019s body, they are able to take the souls of either the deceased or living and use them to create a Philosopher\u2019s Stone inside themselves.  Unlike alchemists who go through three distinct processes to transmute objects, Scar is unique in that he chooses to only use the first two processes. The three processes of alchemy are 1) understanding of the molecular composition, 2) destruction of the material and 3) reconstruction into a new form. Ishvalans are philosophically opposed to the third process, believing it is heretical to make god\u2019s creations better than they already were. RELATED:\u00a0How Tall Is Fullmetal Alchemist's Edward Elric - and How Did He Grow Taller?                When Scar and his brother try to escape the war, State Alchemist Kimblee intercepts\u00a0them, giving Scar his eponymous injury and blowing off his right arm. Before dying,\u00a0his brother attaches his own arm, tattooed with the Grand Arcanum, onto Scar and tells him to continue living. This procedure saved Scar\u2019s life and gifted him with his most dangerous weapon: an arm that can perform the first two processes of alchemic transmutation. With this newfound power of destruction, Scar began a campaign as the \u201cwrath of God\u201d to massacre Amestrian soldiers and State Alchemists by destroying their organs with his right hand.  Scar later manipulates the people of Liore into helping him create a giant transmutation circle throughout their city. In a final battle against Alphonse and Scar at the end of 2003's Fullmetal Alchemist, Kimblee uses the last of his strength to transmute Alphonse into a living bomb while Scar is fatally shot by an Amestrian soldier. Recognizing his imminent demise, Scar uses the last of his power to complete the city-wide transmutation circle he drew and create a Philosopher's Stone within Alphonse to save him. This circle ended up killing hundreds if not thousands of Amestrian soldiers and alchemists, and would serve to horrify the man Scar became in Brotherhood.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Teases New Movie for Series' 20th Anniversary                In Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Scar lost his arm in an almost identical way. State Alchemist Kimblee ambushed a group of Ishvalans and blew them up with his explosive alchemy.\u00a0Scar was left in shock from blood loss due to losing his right arm in the blast, so his brother attached his own arm to young Scar. This gave\u00a0him the ability to access the first two processes of alchemy merely by touching it. As Ed notes later in the series, whether Scar chooses to admit it or not, he is a very skilled alchemist and\u00a0highly\u00a0intelligent to be able to recognize the materials of what he transmutes at a glance.  Like his 2003 counterpart, Scar went on a quest of vengeance to kill State Alchemists and Amestrian soldiers. An important difference, however, is that\u00a0he is not trapping their souls anymore in FMAB. This likewise signals a\u00a0change in character,\u00a0owing to his more compassionate portrayal. As Scar's quest goes on and he begins killing high-ranking military offers, Ed and Al confront him\u00a0over his actions. Winry catches up to the three and learns that Scar was the one who killed her parents, leading her to hold him at gunpoint. Ed leaps over Scar in front of Winry, shielding her from\u00a0his grasp. Reminded of his brother's courage in shielding him\u00a0when Kimblee attacked, Scar began to have a change of heart over the extremity of his mission.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer                 Scar later continues his journey with Yoki, Marcoh and\u00a0Mei Chang.\u00a0This part of his character arc in FMAB is notable for his increasingly relaxed demeanor and decrease in\u00a0acts of violence against random Amestrian soldiers. After\u00a0fighting with Ed and Al in the North\u00a0City,\u00a0Scar is wounded and captured. He is bandaged by Winry and introduced to Major Miles, a fellow Ishvalan who is trying to change the military's perception of Ishvalans from the inside. Scar is\u00a0visibly touched by speaking to Miles and\u00a0begins to truly\u00a0scrutinize\u00a0whether\u00a0his actions are for the greater good.  All of Scar's character growth would\u00a0pay dividends in\u00a0his ultimate fight\u00a0against King Bradley. After stabbing and pinning Scar's right arm to the ground,\u00a0the King attempts to finish\u00a0him off by thrusting his sword into Scar as he is lying on his back unarmed. If this were\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist\u00a02003's Scar, he would've died right here. However, Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0managed to turn the tides by surprising both Bradley and the audience. In the interim leading up to the Promised Day, Scar tattooed his left arm with the symbols of\u00a0all three alchemic processes. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                 This allowed\u00a0Scar to transmute the ground below him into a jagged mass of rocks that served to pierce Bradley's dominant right arm and throw him completely off guard. Instead of relying on the vast network of Philosopher's Stones that ran underground -- as they had unknowingly been doing since Amestria's inception -- Scar, using his knowledge of alkahestry, activates a reversed transmutation circle to allow alchemists to tap into the power of tectonics. If the two Scars were to ever fight, it would result in\u00a0Brotherhood's\u00a0version\u00a0coming out on top using a lethal combination of his destructive and constructive alchemy.\u00a0The emotional growth Scar undergoes in FMAB\u00a0would make him pity the man he was in the 2003 adaptation. Brotherhood's Scar would even compare his old self to Bradley, likely saying they are both using giant human transmutation circles for petty reasons.  Using the wisdom and patience acquired from being an Ishvalan monk, Fullmetal Alchemist:\u00a0Brotherhood's Scar would not only incapacitate his old self but likely also attempt to reason with him. If words fail, he\u00a0still has the unique ability to use his left arm to transmute the surroundings of his old self, incapacitating\u00a0his opponent and his arm, then\u00a0use his own right arm\u00a0for the finishing blow.

Sony Pictures responded to Marvel fans demanding a Sam Raimi-directed, Tobey Maguire-starring\u00a0Spider-Man 4.  In a recent interview, Raimi -- who's helming\u00a0Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- addressed the possibility of another\u00a0Spider-Man project with Maguire. A snippet of that response began making the rounds on social media, and Sony naturally caught wind of the situation. \"Well this has been fun for our mentions today,\" the studio tweeted. \"Friendly reminder, we\u2019re just the social team!\"    RELATED:\u00a0Sony Already Has a Killer Send-Off for Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man in Kraven's Last Hunt    \"I've come to realize after making Doctor Strange that anything is possible, really anything in the Marvel universe, any team-ups,\" Raimi said when asked about picking up where the Spider-Man trilogy from the 2000s and\u00a0Spider-Man: No Way Home left off. \"I love Tobey. I love Kirsten Dunst. I think all things are possible. I don't really have a story or a plan. I don't know if Marvel would be interested in that right now. I don't know what their thoughts are about that. I haven't really pursued that. But it sounds beautiful. Even if it wasn't a Spider-Man movie, I'd love to work with Tobey again, in a different role.\"  RELATED:\u00a0No Way Home Hides a Sneaky Nod to Tobey Maguire\u2019s First Spider-Man Film Fans have been campaigning for\u00a0Spider-Man 4 since shortly after the release of\u00a0No Way Home, which saw Maguire reprise his role as Peter Parker for the first time since 2007's\u00a0Spider-Man 3. A\u00a0fourth entry featuring the Vulture as the main villain entered development in 2007, but those plans were scrapped when Raimi departed the project, and the franchise was rebooted in the 201os with The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel, both starring Andrew Garfield. That series would similarly fizzle out, paving the way for the Tom Holland-led Spider-Man movies under both Sony and Marvel Studios.  \"I think about it all the time,\" Raimi said in 2019 in reference to Spider-Man 4. \"It\u2019s hard not to, because each summer another Spider-Man film comes out! So when you have an unborn one, you can\u2019t help but think what might have been. But I try to focus on what will be, and not look into the past.\" RELATED:\u00a0Spider-Man: No Way Home Sizzle Reel Debuts New Garfield, Maguire Outtakes As for the reason Raimi left Spider-Man 4, he explained in 2013 that \"It really was the most amicable and undramatic of breakups: It was simply that we had a deadline and I couldn't get the story to work on a level that I wanted it to work. I was very unhappy with Spider-Man 3, and I wanted to make Spider-Man 4 to end on a very high note, the best Spider-Man of them all. But I couldn't get the script together in time, due to my own failings, and I said to Sony, 'I don't want to make a movie that is less than great, so I think we shouldn't make this picture. Go ahead with your reboot, which you've been planning anyway.'\"  Spider-Man: No Way Home is available on digital platforms. The movie arrives on Blu-ray, 4K UHD and DVD April 12.

Sony Pictures responded to Marvel fans demanding a Sam Raimi-directed, Tobey Maguire-starring\u00a0Spider-Man 4.  In a recent interview, Raimi -- who's helming\u00a0Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- addressed the possibility of another\u00a0Spider-Man project with Maguire. A snippet of that response began making the rounds on social media, and Sony naturally caught wind of the situation. \"Well this has been fun for our mentions today,\" the studio tweeted. \"Friendly reminder, we\u2019re just the social team!\"    RELATED:\u00a0Sony Already Has a Killer Send-Off for Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man in Kraven's Last Hunt    \"I've come to realize after making Doctor Strange that anything is possible, really anything in the Marvel universe, any team-ups,\" Raimi said when asked about picking up where the Spider-Man trilogy from the 2000s and\u00a0Spider-Man: No Way Home left off. \"I love Tobey. I love Kirsten Dunst. I think all things are possible. I don't really have a story or a plan. I don't know if Marvel would be interested in that right now. I don't know what their thoughts are about that. I haven't really pursued that. But it sounds beautiful. Even if it wasn't a Spider-Man movie, I'd love to work with Tobey again, in a different role.\"  RELATED:\u00a0No Way Home Hides a Sneaky Nod to Tobey Maguire\u2019s First Spider-Man Film Fans have been campaigning for\u00a0Spider-Man 4 since shortly after the release of\u00a0No Way Home, which saw Maguire reprise his role as Peter Parker for the first time since 2007's\u00a0Spider-Man 3. A\u00a0fourth entry featuring the Vulture as the main villain entered development in 2007, but those plans were scrapped when Raimi departed the project, and the franchise was rebooted in the 201os with The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel, both starring Andrew Garfield. That series would similarly fizzle out, paving the way for the Tom Holland-led Spider-Man movies under both Sony and Marvel Studios.  \"I think about it all the time,\" Raimi said in 2019 in reference to Spider-Man 4. \"It\u2019s hard not to, because each summer another Spider-Man film comes out! So when you have an unborn one, you can\u2019t help but think what might have been. But I try to focus on what will be, and not look into the past.\" RELATED:\u00a0Spider-Man: No Way Home Sizzle Reel Debuts New Garfield, Maguire Outtakes As for the reason Raimi left Spider-Man 4, he explained in 2013 that \"It really was the most amicable and undramatic of breakups: It was simply that we had a deadline and I couldn't get the story to work on a level that I wanted it to work. I was very unhappy with Spider-Man 3, and I wanted to make Spider-Man 4 to end on a very high note, the best Spider-Man of them all. But I couldn't get the script together in time, due to my own failings, and I said to Sony, 'I don't want to make a movie that is less than great, so I think we shouldn't make this picture. Go ahead with your reboot, which you've been planning anyway.'\"  Spider-Man: No Way Home is available on digital platforms. The movie arrives on Blu-ray, 4K UHD and DVD April 12.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Episode 26, now streaming on Funimation.  Throughout\u00a0its two-part first season, How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom made an impression as an isekai with a difference. Kazuya Souma was summoned to the Kingdom of Elfrieden to be its king, and\u00a0has used his knowledge of Earth's politics to turn it into a fairer society. However, just as Souma had a moment to relax, he was called upon\u00a0for an audience with the previous king, Albert, and his wife Elisha. In the isekai's Part 2\u00a0finale, the\u00a0couple revealed a secret to Souma that completely changes the nature of his arrival. Albert revealed that, in another time, he had made Souma prime minister instead of king. In this alternate timeline, Albert had succumbed to paranoia and suspicion, banishing Souma for crimes he did not commit. When this resulted in disaster, Elisha used her dark magic to transfer Albert's memories to his younger self so his fatal mistake would not come to pass. This resulted in the story\u00a0Realist Hero fans are familiar with --\u00a0but how \"real\" is the doomed kingdom from Albert's memories?  RELATED: The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home                Souma asked why Albert had trusted him so much when they first met, but refused to converse with him since. Albert began by recounting a familiar story of a hero being summoned from another world. The nostalgic, fairy-tale way\u00a0he described his first meeting with Souma was exemplified by appealing and strikingly stylized watercolor illustrations. However, using short animated scenes may have made this glimpse into an alternate Realist Hero story more immersive. Albert continued that this hero\u00a0was appointed prime minister rather than king, but like his familiar counterpart\u00a0had enacted policies that were popular with average people but enraged\u00a0the aristocracy. The nobles swayed Albert's judgment with false accusations until he dismissed Souma. The kingdom's enemies took advantage of his absence\u00a0to invade, and\u00a0Elfrieden collapsed. Elisha transferred\u00a0Albert's memories (and presumably her own) back in time as they were crushed by their own castle, and Albert rectified his mistake by making Souma king and allowing\u00a0him to rule as he saw fit.  If receiving his future memories caused Albert to change his behavior, is there still a timeline in which he and Elisha died? When they smiled as the castle crumbled, did they feel\u00a0their deaths would have meaning, or that they weren't dying at all? Upon hearing the story, Souma's response revealed how his modern-day\u00a0perspective was shaped by science fiction, rephrasing Elisha's magical abilities as a \"time slip\" or \"time leap.\" RELATED: The Women of Realist Hero Hold Souma Accountable in Episode 24                Souma asked about Liscia, his fianc\u00e9e and Albert and Elisha's daughter. Albert explained that this version of Liscia loved\u00a0him from afar, and lobbied unsuccessfully to overturn his dismissal. Liscia was the only member of Souma's court\u00a0whom he met even without the recruitment broadcast he couldn't make in this timeline. A brief scene of Liscia walking away was unfortunately her only appearance in the flashback. It would have been interesting to see Prime Minister Souma interact with this equally\u00a0different variant of Liscia, who was not promised as his fianc\u00e9e and did not fight for him in the civil war.  Liscia had returned to Randel Castle, which Elisha pointed out was destroyed by the aristocrats in the old world. As he left, Souma took a moment to assure them\u00a0that even the old version of himself would have protected Liscia, and they may have survived the onslaught. This appeared to provide a great deal of relief for the couple, despite the fact that Liscia and the man she loved were alive and well anyway. RELATED: The Best Isekai Told From the 'Villain's' Perspective                This relief could theoretically have been\u00a0because\u00a0the world of their memories still existed in some capacity\u00a0due to\u00a0Elisha's magic, and they wanted to believe Liscia could still be alive in it. This would make the\u00a0finale's timelines\u00a0into\u00a0a more traditional multiverse scenario. However, it is more likely\u00a0that Albert and Elisha's love for their daughter was so strong that they hated the idea of her having died -- even in a timeline that would never come to pass. Albert reminded Souma that his memories were the same as if\u00a0he had lived through the kingdom's collapse; it is unsurprising that he would not want to\u00a0believe he had memories of a time when his daughter was dead.  Albert revealed the only other person\u00a0who knew about his\u00a0dark memories of the future was Duke Georg Carmine. Carmine\u00a0had lost his reputation and ultimately his life\u00a0in a secret plan to help Souma identify corrupt nobles. Souma lamented that, \"We were running along the track that had been laid out for us.\" However, there are some ways in which\u00a0this revelation defied the fatalistic\u00a0sense of powerlessness and pointlessness that often comes with prophecy stories. Souma's skill as a leader may have been a foregone conclusion to Albert and Carmine, but he\u00a0still ruled with his own judgment and creativity in both timelines.  Episode 26 ended with Souma proposing outright to Liscia, and addressing his court with some words of encouragement. He may have been spurred to express his appreciation by the reminder of how close he had come to never meeting them. Realist Hero's finale may not have featured a typical multiverse, but it exemplified what makes the concept so fascinating: people\u00a0are only\u00a0a few different choices\u00a0away from a completely different life.

Vault's West of Sundown #1   Artist  Jim Terry    Colorist  Triona Farrell    Cover Artist  Tim Daniel, Aaron Campbell    Letterer  Crank!    Price  3.99    Publisher  Vault Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Tim Seeley, Aaron Campbell      DC Comics veterans Tim Seeley and Aaron Campbell have penned their own original story, an ambitious amalgam of vampire thriller, monster horror, and Old Western, debuting this week from Vault Comics. Besides its illustrious writing team, West of Sundown #1 is created by artist Jim Terry, with colors by Triona Farrell and letters by Crank!.\u00a0The cover touts a vintage monster story, framed by expressionistic art, gorgeous enough that many people will be buying this comic based on the outward aesthetic alone.  West of Sundown #1 follows the unexpected and untimely waking of vampire Constance Der Abend midway through a civil war she had very much intended to sleep through. Stumbling across her resting place, Dooley O'Shaughnessy, a confederate soldier without a cause, jumps at the opportunity to bail out of the war and become a full-time vampire manservant. When an unfortunate twist of fate drives them out of their fashionable New York upper-crust life, the pair must return to Constance's homeland of New Mexico to a much-changed landscape teeming with threats and lurking monsters. RELATED:\u00a0DC's Batman #122 Comic Review                 Seeley and Campbell have delivered an extremely functional prologue to their vampire Western, although largely devoid of the kind of flair or style\u00a0expected from the intersection of two incredibly dramatic genres. The plot itself has admirable clarity, but there is very little wit or elegance to the dialogue, especially with such colorful characters to play with. The dynamic between Dooley and Constance is touching, arguably the most interesting and novel part of the whole comic. Their relationship, somewhere between maternal and benevolent god, feels authentic and has lots of room to grow. Disappointingly, West of Sundown #1 does little to add to or complicate existing vampire lore, dealing mostly in already overplayed stereotypes with a\u00a0 pale, dark-haired rich socialite who feeds off only those who deserve it. The twist of Constance's homeland and its importance is a much-needed detail that makes the story infinitely more memorable. Perhaps West of Sundown is hoarding its best and most inventive ideas for later in the story,\u00a0which would only suggest some problems with the first issue's\u00a0pacing and judgment.  The art, all produced by Terry, presents some of the strongest moments of West of Sundown #1. His depiction of Constance is appropriately inhuman in her perfection. Frequently the humans appear monstrous in contrast to her, a fascinating subversion waiting to be experimented with. The expressionist style of the cover is scarcely visible in the comic itself, generally working in much more conventional lines, which adds to the clarity but detracts from the distinct mood the comic is trying to set. The two-page spreads are the most artistically ambitious moments of the issue, with smaller undefined panels looping around a centerpiece in a way that feels chaotic and miasmic in equal measure, to stunning results.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review Farrell's colors are understated, often softened and neutral even in intense moments. The sepia undertone sells the vintage angle, making the comic feel like it is moving through the lens of the past. However, it means that any expectations built from the gorgeous cover of an ethereal, experimental visual experience are disappointed,\u00a0met instead with a more lifelike and pedestrian approach. The letters, courtesy of Crank!, add a huge amount of much-needed dimension to the dialogue. The sound effects are also very well considered. The choice to change up the lettering for Dooley's internal monologue does a great job of setting a tone for the comic's second half and communicating more about Dooley's personality.  West of Sundown #1 has all the ingredients to be a terrific horror/Western, but the debut issue lacks edge or\u00a0bite. There are moments of visual flair or satisfying character development, but overall, it fails to shock or awe or deliver on the aesthetic hinted at by the cover art. The comic's conclusion promises that conflict is just around the corner, and this team has put together an intriguing enough premise to make the next installments worth investigating.

Vault's West of Sundown #1   Artist  Jim Terry    Colorist  Triona Farrell    Cover Artist  Tim Daniel, Aaron Campbell    Letterer  Crank!    Price  3.99    Publisher  Vault Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Tim Seeley, Aaron Campbell      DC Comics veterans Tim Seeley and Aaron Campbell have penned their own original story, an ambitious amalgam of vampire thriller, monster horror, and Old Western, debuting this week from Vault Comics. Besides its illustrious writing team, West of Sundown #1 is created by artist Jim Terry, with colors by Triona Farrell and letters by Crank!.\u00a0The cover touts a vintage monster story, framed by expressionistic art, gorgeous enough that many people will be buying this comic based on the outward aesthetic alone.  West of Sundown #1 follows the unexpected and untimely waking of vampire Constance Der Abend midway through a civil war she had very much intended to sleep through. Stumbling across her resting place, Dooley O'Shaughnessy, a confederate soldier without a cause, jumps at the opportunity to bail out of the war and become a full-time vampire manservant. When an unfortunate twist of fate drives them out of their fashionable New York upper-crust life, the pair must return to Constance's homeland of New Mexico to a much-changed landscape teeming with threats and lurking monsters. RELATED:\u00a0DC's Batman #122 Comic Review                 Seeley and Campbell have delivered an extremely functional prologue to their vampire Western, although largely devoid of the kind of flair or style\u00a0expected from the intersection of two incredibly dramatic genres. The plot itself has admirable clarity, but there is very little wit or elegance to the dialogue, especially with such colorful characters to play with. The dynamic between Dooley and Constance is touching, arguably the most interesting and novel part of the whole comic. Their relationship, somewhere between maternal and benevolent god, feels authentic and has lots of room to grow. Disappointingly, West of Sundown #1 does little to add to or complicate existing vampire lore, dealing mostly in already overplayed stereotypes with a\u00a0 pale, dark-haired rich socialite who feeds off only those who deserve it. The twist of Constance's homeland and its importance is a much-needed detail that makes the story infinitely more memorable. Perhaps West of Sundown is hoarding its best and most inventive ideas for later in the story,\u00a0which would only suggest some problems with the first issue's\u00a0pacing and judgment.  The art, all produced by Terry, presents some of the strongest moments of West of Sundown #1. His depiction of Constance is appropriately inhuman in her perfection. Frequently the humans appear monstrous in contrast to her, a fascinating subversion waiting to be experimented with. The expressionist style of the cover is scarcely visible in the comic itself, generally working in much more conventional lines, which adds to the clarity but detracts from the distinct mood the comic is trying to set. The two-page spreads are the most artistically ambitious moments of the issue, with smaller undefined panels looping around a centerpiece in a way that feels chaotic and miasmic in equal measure, to stunning results.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review Farrell's colors are understated, often softened and neutral even in intense moments. The sepia undertone sells the vintage angle, making the comic feel like it is moving through the lens of the past. However, it means that any expectations built from the gorgeous cover of an ethereal, experimental visual experience are disappointed,\u00a0met instead with a more lifelike and pedestrian approach. The letters, courtesy of Crank!, add a huge amount of much-needed dimension to the dialogue. The sound effects are also very well considered. The choice to change up the lettering for Dooley's internal monologue does a great job of setting a tone for the comic's second half and communicating more about Dooley's personality.  West of Sundown #1 has all the ingredients to be a terrific horror/Western, but the debut issue lacks edge or\u00a0bite. There are moments of visual flair or satisfying character development, but overall, it fails to shock or awe or deliver on the aesthetic hinted at by the cover art. The comic's conclusion promises that conflict is just around the corner, and this team has put together an intriguing enough premise to make the next installments worth investigating.

By Calum Nicholson-Walker Published 6 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The mystery of Marijoa's treasure has haunted One Piece ever since the Dressrosa arc, but Chapter 1045 may have just revealed a vital clue.                 WARNING: The following contains spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1045, \"Next Level,\" by Eiichiro Oda, Stephen Paul and Vanessa Satone, available in English from Viz Media.  One Piece\u00a0is a series of many, many mysteries, and the sacred treasure of Marijoa is one of the most pressing. Ever since it was first mentioned in Chapter 761 by Donquixote Doflamingo, the question of the treasure's true nature has loomed large over the story. At that point, all that was revealed was that it had the power to ''shake the world to its foundations',' and that Doflamingo was able to use this knowledge as leverage over the Celestial Dragons. It wouldn't be until One Piece Chapter 906 that the treasure was finally shown, but its appearance\u00a0only raised further questions.\u00a0Kept in a frozen vault beneath Pangaea Castle, seemingly only accessible by the World Government's true leader Imu, is a giant Straw Hat -- identical to that of Luffy's, other than its immense size.  RELATED:\u00a0One Piece Debuts New Straw Hat Pirates Costumes in Full Color                  How exactly a giant Straw Hat could wield immense power in the\u00a0One Piece\u00a0world has led to countless speculation, including who the original wearer of the hat might be. The most popular theory is that it belonged to Joy Boy -- a figure from the Void Century who wielded immense influence by having ties to the\u00a0Ryugu Kingdom, being comrades with the ancient elephant Zunesha, and even potentially being the original owner of the One Piece itself. That said, the\u00a0Joy Boy theory would also mean that he has to be a giant to match his headwear. While not out of the realm of possibility by any means, it's an extra wrinkle that remained unconfirmed by the story, meaning the\u00a0idea was not ironclad.  Recent revelations, however, have added credence to the theory. After nearly dying in Chapter 1043, Luffy regains consciousness and his Devil Fruit awakens -- an event\u00a0that Zunesha heralds as the return of Joy Boy. RELATED:\u00a0Is a Turn-Based Battle System Right for One Piece Odyssey?                  In the next Chapter, the Five Elders discuss the true nature of Luffy's fruit -- that it is in actuality the Human-Human Fruit Model: Nika, an incredibly mighty Zoan Fruit that grants its user the power of the Sun God. Given Zunesha's comment, it seems incredibly likely that Joy Boy was the previous wielder of the fruit.  If this is the case, then the giant Straw Hat finally has an explanation. In One Piece Chapter 1045, Luffy proceeds to test out his newly awakened fruit's powers -- including\u00a0gigantification, which Luffy humorously uses to play jump-rope with Kaido's body. If Joy Boy was indeed the previous user of the Human-Human Fruit Model: Nika, then it goes a long way toward explaining why the Straw Hat was\u00a0so massive in size. After all, Luffy's clothes grew in conjunction with his body -- it's entirely possible that Joy Boy's hat was a regular-sized one that grew thanks to the fruit's powers. Alternatively, it could be that Joy Boy used the fruit to remain in giant form all the time, and the hat being giant was its default state.  RELATED:\u00a0One Piece: Will Luffy's New Powers Appear in the Upcoming Movie?                  While these revelations go a long way to explain why the Straw Hat in Marijoa's vault is\u00a0that size, much about the treasure remains a mystery. Why it wields such immense political power -- aside from being the headwear of such a notorious figure -- is unknown at this point, as well as why it needs to be kept in cold storage specifically. Nonetheless, the pieces of the puzzle of Marijoa's sacred treasure are slowly but surely coming together.\u00a0One Piece\u00a0may still be a story built on a foundation of many, many mysteries, but with Luffy's awakening, the series has gone a long way to answering readers' many, many questions. As the ''Wano'' arc hurtles toward its climax, no doubt many more revelations are on their way.

Did One Piece Just Reveal the Secret of Marijoa's Treasure?  By Calum Nicholson-Walker Published 6 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The mystery of Marijoa's treasure has haunted One Piece ever since the Dressrosa arc, but Chapter 1045 may have just revealed a vital clue.                 WARNING: The following contains spoilers for One Piece Chapter 1045, \"Next Level,\" by Eiichiro Oda, Stephen Paul and Vanessa Satone, available in English from Viz Media.  One Piece\u00a0is a series of many, many mysteries, and the sacred treasure of Marijoa is one of the most pressing. Ever since it was first mentioned in Chapter 761 by Donquixote Doflamingo, the question of the treasure's true nature has loomed large over the story. At that point, all that was revealed was that it had the power to ''shake the world to its foundations',' and that Doflamingo was able to use this knowledge as leverage over the Celestial Dragons. It wouldn't be until One Piece Chapter 906 that the treasure was finally shown, but its appearance\u00a0only raised further questions.\u00a0Kept in a frozen vault beneath Pangaea Castle, seemingly only accessible by the World Government's true leader Imu, is a giant Straw Hat -- identical to that of Luffy's, other than its immense size.  RELATED:\u00a0One Piece Debuts New Straw Hat Pirates Costumes in Full Color                  How exactly a giant Straw Hat could wield immense power in the\u00a0One Piece\u00a0world has led to countless speculation, including who the original wearer of the hat might be. The most popular theory is that it belonged to Joy Boy -- a figure from the Void Century who wielded immense influence by having ties to the\u00a0Ryugu Kingdom, being comrades with the ancient elephant Zunesha, and even potentially being the original owner of the One Piece itself. That said, the\u00a0Joy Boy theory would also mean that he has to be a giant to match his headwear. While not out of the realm of possibility by any means, it's an extra wrinkle that remained unconfirmed by the story, meaning the\u00a0idea was not ironclad.  Recent revelations, however, have added credence to the theory. After nearly dying in Chapter 1043, Luffy regains consciousness and his Devil Fruit awakens -- an event\u00a0that Zunesha heralds as the return of Joy Boy. RELATED:\u00a0Is a Turn-Based Battle System Right for One Piece Odyssey?                  In the next Chapter, the Five Elders discuss the true nature of Luffy's fruit -- that it is in actuality the Human-Human Fruit Model: Nika, an incredibly mighty Zoan Fruit that grants its user the power of the Sun God. Given Zunesha's comment, it seems incredibly likely that Joy Boy was the previous wielder of the fruit.  If this is the case, then the giant Straw Hat finally has an explanation. In One Piece Chapter 1045, Luffy proceeds to test out his newly awakened fruit's powers -- including\u00a0gigantification, which Luffy humorously uses to play jump-rope with Kaido's body. If Joy Boy was indeed the previous user of the Human-Human Fruit Model: Nika, then it goes a long way toward explaining why the Straw Hat was\u00a0so massive in size. After all, Luffy's clothes grew in conjunction with his body -- it's entirely possible that Joy Boy's hat was a regular-sized one that grew thanks to the fruit's powers. Alternatively, it could be that Joy Boy used the fruit to remain in giant form all the time, and the hat being giant was its default state.  RELATED:\u00a0One Piece: Will Luffy's New Powers Appear in the Upcoming Movie?                  While these revelations go a long way to explain why the Straw Hat in Marijoa's vault is\u00a0that size, much about the treasure remains a mystery. Why it wields such immense political power -- aside from being the headwear of such a notorious figure -- is unknown at this point, as well as why it needs to be kept in cold storage specifically. Nonetheless, the pieces of the puzzle of Marijoa's sacred treasure are slowly but surely coming together.\u00a0One Piece\u00a0may still be a story built on a foundation of many, many mysteries, but with Luffy's awakening, the series has gone a long way to answering readers' many, many questions. As the ''Wano'' arc hurtles toward its climax, no doubt many more revelations are on their way.
