             Much like the first season, Beastars 2 sets the bar high for CGI animation and still manages to knock it out of the park. The continuing story of Legosi and his internal struggles is a joy to follow, and leaves me hoping a Season 3 is on the books. \r Story: Continuing from where Season 1 left off, Legosi and Louis set out to face the consequences of their attack on the Shishigumi/Lion Group. Their internal conflicts are told in parrallel with a very satisfying conclusion that perfectly contrasts their experiences. There are a number of moments that feel slightly forced, like the author couldn't quite make the next scene happen naturally, but overall the progression felt very convincing. 9/10; certainly not perfect, but immensely satisfying. \r Animation: Top notch all the way through. The models, animation rigging, color palletes, and camera angles are all on point. Easily the best Full-CGI animation I've ever seen in an anime, and in many ways even better than some traditional-medium shows.  10/10; I'm excited to see where the studio takes this 3d animation in the future \r Sound: Also top notch. Everything lines up perfectly, the voice acting is stellar, and the soundtrack is the sort that you find yourself humming in the shower out of nowhere. 10/10; absolutely amazing \r Characters: While the main characters have strong convictions, they're presented as movable and impressionable. They claim ideals and proclaim motivations that they can later go back on after experiencing growth and change. They're dynamic and believable in almost every way. That said, a few of the side characters felt a fair bit less believable - is it because they didn't get enough screen time to fully flesh out their own growth? Perhaps. At any rate, this is a cut above many other anime, even despite my issues with a handful of characters. 8/10; If your only problem is that your side characters needed more of their own story told, I think you're in a good place. \r Overall: While it's certainly not the best anime I've ever seen, it's absolutely one of the best anime in recent seasons and well worth a 5-star rating. This is the kind of show that I'll remember and have in the back of my mind for the rest of my life, and find myself comparing other anime and even non-anime shows to. 10/10; Perhaps not life-changing, but certainly life-influencing material.

The models, animation rigging, color palletes, and camera angles are all on point. Easily the best Full-CGI animation I've ever seen in an anime, and in many ways even better than some traditional-medium shows.  10/10; I'm excited to see where the studio takes this 3d animation in the future \r Sound: Also top notch. Everything lines up perfectly, the voice acting is stellar, and the soundtrack is the sort that you find yourself humming in the shower out of nowhere. 10/10; absolutely amazing \r Characters: While the main characters have strong convictions, they're presented as movable and impressionable. They claim ideals and proclaim motivations that they can later go back on after experiencing growth and change. They're dynamic and believable in almost every way. That said, a few of the side characters felt a fair bit less believable - is it because they didn't get enough screen time to fully flesh out their own growth? Perhaps. At any rate, this is a cut above many other anime, even despite my issues with a handful of characters. 8/10; If your only problem is that your side characters needed more of their own story told, I think you're in a good place. \r Overall: While it's certainly not the best anime I've ever seen, it's absolutely one of the best anime in recent seasons and well worth a 5-star rating. This is the kind of show that I'll remember and have in the back of my mind for the rest of my life, and find myself comparing other anime and even non-anime shows to. 10/10; Perhaps not life-changing, but certainly life-influencing material.

                      \u201cCinderella Rhapsody\u201d is the third installment in the \u201cProject A-Ko\u201d franchise, and while it maintains the general production values from its prequels, it\u2019s a step down in terms of plot quality. \r This OVA introduces a new character named Kei, a motorcyclist who almost runs over C-Ko and is subsequently run over by A-Ko. Kei hardly speaks, and he doesn\u2019t do that much, but A-Ko and later B-Ko fall for him immediately for no reason. I realize it\u2019s part of the humor of the OVA to have the two girls fall head-over-heels for a guy with seemingly no personality, but after both of them spent so much time fighting for/over C-Ko in the past two installments, it seems a bit out of character for them to suddenly be boy-crazy. C-Ko is also even more annoying here than in the previous stories, especially in how she treats A-Ko. Meanwhile, B-Ko\u2019s minions get a little more screen time here, which is nice. \r Most of the OVA is rather slow, with the wacky action and outrageous destruction which this franchise is known for only happening towards the end. The end is also a bit confusing \u2014 the city defense forces are called on, perhaps due to a misunderstanding, and there\u2019s a whole montage of various people around the city stopping whatever they\u2019re doing, donning Power Rangers-type gear and heading towards the spaceship. This whole sequence could have been explained better. \r The voice acting is mostly good, but some of the minor characters, like the ones in the aforementioned montage, sound like they\u2019re just reading their lines (perhaps they\u2019re not professional voice actors). Kei hardly speaks, but for the few words he does utter, the delivery is okay. \r The music is similar to that of the first OVA \u2014 not bad, but not particularly memorable. Same with the animation and art. \r Regarding objectionable content, there are a few scenes with nudity, with the most explicit being a scene where some men are watching an adult film in a theater, and are very clearly \u201cinterrupted.\u201d There are also a fair amount of flashing lights in this one. \r Overall, this OVA is a downgrade from the previous two installments of the franchise, but it is still somewhat watchable and further explores the zany characters of Graviton City. I recommend watching this only if you have seen the movie and the first OVA, but I advise that you keep your expectations low.

I realize it\u2019s part of the humor of the OVA to have the two girls fall head-over-heels for a guy with seemingly no personality, but after both of them spent so much time fighting for/over C-Ko in the past two installments, it seems a bit out of character for them to suddenly be boy-crazy.

violence and murder. This perfectly illustrates exactly what Beastars has in store for you. Split across 12 episodes of hand-drawn animation, Beastars is a well written, surprisingly reflective series that touches on issues of sexism and racism in a way that feels organic, using the animal-inhabited world to depict clear divides between carnivores and herbivores. All of this back-dropped by a murder and a thick dose of \u201cwhodunit\u201d interwoven with these social issues. \r The world of beastars is relatively simple but it works on a hierarchal level of carnivores and herbivores living harmoniously together. Most of the action during this first season takes place in Cherryton Academy, a fictional school that sees its foundations rocked when a shadowy carnivore murders a llama named Tem. As hostilities grow and the battle lines are drawn between the two sides, at the centre of this conflict lies a gentle wolf named Legoshi. \r Playing out with a simple forbidden love angle, Legoshi finds himself infatuated with a dwarf rabbit named Haru and across the season we see their friendship grow while the school\u2019s beastar (the most popular and top animal) Rouis become entangled in this with a light dose of a love triangle introduced. This story dances harmoniously with the \u201cwhodunit\u201d, building up to a climactic few episodes where Haru\u2019s life hangs in the balance and secrets are revealed before the open-ending ready for season 2. \r Where Beastars shines though is with its visual design and aesthetic. Each episode showcases a different stylistic interpretation of animation, with everything from silhoutted lights and animal outlines used to paint a separate scene inside to split-screen shots and reflections, there\u2019s an incredible array of talent used to show off the best hand-drawn animation can offer. There\u2019s no question that a lot of animators are moving across to CGI-styled efforts but Beastars is a great example why this traditional method works as well as it does. \r While it\u2019s advisory to watch in the standard Japanese subbed version for authenticity, the English dub isn\u2019t actually that bad. Haru and Legoshi have compelling voices attached to them and the various supporting players do well to flesh out the cast at the heart of this one. While the side characters don\u2019t have an awful lot to do this season, the promise of more Beastars to come in the near future is enough to forgive this, especially given we don\u2019t actually find out who killed Tem by the end of the season. \r The one element that really helps Beastars shine is with its social themes. There\u2019s a really interesting undercurrent of societal issues here that play out perfectly in the carnivore/herbivore juxtaposition that run rampant throughout the season. The most obvious is the romance at the heart of this, with numerous animals expressing their concerns over the taboo nature of Legoshi\u2019s feelings. More subtly are the subverted expectations thrown into the fold time and again, especially with some of the herbivores that are outright mean and conniving by comparison to the gentle giants. \r Beastars is quite simply a really well written anime and together with the hand-drawn animation and strong themes, make it one of the better animated efforts this year. The open-ending and lack of resolution for this overarching are a bit disappointing, and the abrupt ending does little to quell this either. Thankfully this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ve seen from these charaters and if this season is anything to go by, season 2 of Beastars should be a very interesting proposition indeed. \r OVERALL:8/10              Helpful       report                          ", "      ", "    ", "  ", "", "MyAnimeList.net      Hide AdsLoginSign Up  AllAnimeMangaCharactersPeopleCompaniesManga StoreNewsFeatured ArticlesForumClubsUsers               View all results for ${ keyword }  Anime  Anime Search Top Anime Seasonal Anime Videos Reviews Recommendations 2022 ChallengeFantasy Anime League  Manga  Manga Search Top Manga Manga Store Reviews Recommendations 2022 Challenge   Community  Interest Stacks Forums Clubs Blogs Users   Industry  News Featured Articles People Characters Companies MAL\u00d7Japan   Watch  Episode Videos Anime Trailers  Read  Manga Store   Help  About Support Advertising FAQ Report StaffMAL Supporter     Reviews                Top                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Anime                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Beastars                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Reviews                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               NomineMalum's Review                               Apr 10, 2022                    12 of 12 episodes seen                 Overall Rating:         8          Beastars  (Anime) add            (All reviews)                         NomineMalum (All reviews)   1                people found this review helpful                           more pics      Overall 8   Story 8   Animation 9   Sound 9   Character 9   Enjoyment 10                              Imagine an adult version of Zootopia, complete with an undercurrent of sex, violence and murder.

There\u2019s no question that a lot of animators are moving across to CGI-styled efforts but Beastars is a great example why this traditional method works as well as it does. \r While it\u2019s advisory to watch in the standard Japanese subbed version for authenticity, the English dub isn\u2019t actually that bad. Haru and Legoshi have compelling voices attached to them and the various supporting players do well to flesh out the cast at the heart of this one. While the side characters don\u2019t have an awful lot to do this season, the promise of more Beastars to come in the near future is enough to forgive this, especially given we don\u2019t actually find out who killed Tem by the end of the season. \r The one element that really helps Beastars shine is with its social themes. There\u2019s a really interesting undercurrent of societal issues here that play out perfectly in the carnivore/herbivore juxtaposition that run rampant throughout the season. The most obvious is the romance at the heart of this, with numerous animals expressing their concerns over the taboo nature of Legoshi\u2019s feelings. More subtly are the subverted expectations thrown into the fold time and again, especially with some of the herbivores that are outright mean and conniving by comparison to the gentle giants. \r Beastars is quite simply a really well written anime and together with the hand-drawn animation and strong themes, make it one of the better animated efforts this year. The open-ending and lack of resolution for this overarching are a bit disappointing, and the abrupt ending does little to quell this either. Thankfully this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ve seen from these charaters and if this season is anything to go by, season 2 of Beastars should be a very interesting proposition indeed. \r OVERALL:8/10              Helpful  ", "       more pics  ", "    ", " more pics ", "   Overall 8   Story 8   Animation 9   Sound 9   Character 9   Enjoyment 10   ", " Helpful ", "    report    ", "   report   ", "  report  ", "", "     ", " ", " ", "", "      ", "    ", "  ", "", "   MoreTop Anime            1 Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood   2 Gintama\u00b0   3 Steins;Gate   4 Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2   5 Spy x Family     MoreTop Airing Anime            1 Spy x Family   2 Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic   3 One Piece   4 Holo no Graffiti   5 Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu. 2nd Season     MoreMost Popular Characters            1 Lamperouge, Lelouch   2 Levi   3 Lawliet, L   4 Monkey D., Luffy   5 Roronoa, Zoro     ", "  MoreTop Anime            1 Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood   2 Gintama\u00b0   3 Steins;Gate   4 Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2   5 Spy x Family     MoreTop Airing Anime            1 Spy x Family   2 Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic   3 One Piece   4 Holo no Graffiti   5 Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu. 2nd Season     MoreMost Popular Characters            1 Lamperouge, Lelouch   2 Levi   3 Lawliet, L   4 Monkey D., Luffy   5 Roronoa, Zoro    ", " MoreTop Anime            1 Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood   2 Gintama\u00b0   3 Steins;Gate   4 Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2   5 Spy x Family   ", " MoreTop Airing Anime            1 Spy x Family   2 Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic   3 One Piece   4 Holo no Graffiti   5 Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu. 2nd Season   ", " MoreMost Popular Characters            1 Lamperouge, Lelouch   2 Levi   3 Lawliet, L   4 Monkey D., Luffy   5 Roronoa, Zoro   ", "                Home   About Press Room Support Advertising FAQ Terms Privacy Privacy Settings Do Not Sell My Personal Information Cookie Notice at Collection Sitemap   Login Sign Up     Tokyo Otaku Mode Honey's Anime Manga Store          MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co.,Ltd. \u00a92022 All Rights Reserved.
