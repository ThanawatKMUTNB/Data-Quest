Josh Bell Apr 1, 2022                      Morbius\u2019 Rushed & Muddled Story Won\u2019t Quench Audiences' Thirst  Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be.  Sam Stone Mar 31, 2022                      The Contractor Drops Chris Pine in a Generic Spy Thriller With Little Depth  The Contractor is a standard spy story that makes an effort to engage with deeper themes about the treatment of veterans but falls short.  Josh Bell Mar 30, 2022                      Barbarians Compellingly Tackles Toxic Masculinity But Misses Its Landing  IFC Midnight's Barbarians examines toxic masculinity through the lens of a home invasion thriller that ultimately muddles its messaging.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 30, 2022                      Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out  Night's End brings a lot of intriguing ideas to the surface around the strange powers of isolation but it ultimately doesn't stick its landing.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 29, 2022                      Nitram Offers No Valuable Perspective On a Horrific, Real-Life Tragedy  Director Justin Kurzel's Nitram is somber and pointless. It neither honors victims of a real-life mass shooting nor asks for social change.  Josh Bell Mar 28, 2022                      Morbius' Creepy Motion Poster Is a Terrifying Sight  A terrifying motion poster for Sony and Marvel's Morbius brings the vampiric antihero to life.   Samuel Gelman Mar 22, 2022                      Measure of Revenge\u2019s Muddled Ambitions Lead to a Middling Thriller  Measure of Revenge features some interesting moments and a strong female lead but gets muddled in too many genres and styles to truly land.  Jon Mendelsohn Mar 21, 2022                      REVIEW: Umma Teases a Provocative Story But Overuses Haunted House Tropes  Although Umma opens as a film that's easy to root for -- due to its complex story and unique imagery -- it relies too much on haunted house tropes.  Caitlin Chappell Mar 21, 2022                      Everything Everywhere All At Once Flaunts Michelle Yeoh's Unmatched Star Power  A24's Everything Everywhere All At Once is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, filled with fantastic action set-pieces and loads of heart.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 21, 2022                      Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood Charmingly Melds Nostalgia & Space Fantasy  Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood is a quirky, delightful combination of a realistic \u201860s coming-of-age story with a boy\u2019s space fantasy.  Reuben Baron Mar 21, 2022                      The Lost City Elevates a Standard Plot With Humor & Chemistry  The Lost City's endearing characters, strong performances, and enthusiastic embrace of genre tropes elevate a by-the-numbers plot.  Brandon Zachary Mar 18, 2022                      Windfall Channels the Suspense & Wit of Vintage Thrillers  Full of dry, dark humor, Netflix's Windfall evokes vintage noir and suspense thrillers, with a slight modern strain of social commentary.  Josh Bell Mar 18, 2022                      REVIEW: Ti West's X Serves a Fun & Sensual Bloodbath With a Killer Message  From its opening scene, Ti West's X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.  Cassandra Clarke Mar 17, 2022                      Cheaper By the Dozen\u2019s Wholesome Family Delivers a Feel-Good Story  Disney+'s Cheaper By the Dozen reimagines the Baker family for a more representative and recognizable story about the power of familial love.  E.L. Meszaros Mar 17, 2022                      Deep Water Surfaces as a Half-Hearted & Murky Erotic Thriller  Deep Water treads along with little to no suspense -- minus its ending -- and centers on a couple with murky character development.

Home Anime Cheer Boys Is a Remarkably Mature Anime About Male Cheerleaders    Cheer Boys Is a Remarkably Mature Anime About Male Cheerleaders  By Gina DiGiovancarlo Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Sports anime from the past decade is laden with \"manservice\" shows, but Cheer Boys stands out for its direct opposition to the trend.                 Within anime and manga, the sports genre is typically known for certain characteristics depending on the dominant sex making up the cast. Titles like Slam Dunk and Hajime no Ippo, which revolve around a boys team, are charged with energy and perform anime tropes while adhering closely to the reality of playing the sport. If the cast is a girls team, or even has a mixed team, the aim is typically fan service. Whether it\u2019s Welcome to the Ballroom joking that boys only start dancing to get close to girls or Keijo!!!!!!!! being about girls in bathing suits knocking each other into the water with their chests and butts, the focus is on their bodies and the male gaze.  Starting in the 2010s, however, the norms of sports anime were flipped as more \u201cmanservice\u201d series aired. For a short while, anime with all-male casts seemed to be trying to outdo each other on this front, so 2016's refreshingly calm Cheer Boys!! went largely unnoticed. At the time, the Free! franchise had peaked in popularity and the stage was set for titles like Yuri!!! on Ice and All Out!! to make their marks on the sports genre. Cheer Boys!!, however, went against the grain with its more mature, nuanced look at sports. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance \u2013 But It Isn't Necessary                   While its cast is absolutely one of pretty anime boys, the series doesn\u2019t rely on eye candy. Cheer Boys!! does show its boys in various states of undress, but it\u2019s done in a different way than the manservice shows of its time. Whether it be Haru examining his shoulder in the shower or the boys unwinding at a local bath house, the show's \u201ccamera\u201d never focuses on titillation. It handles the cast\u2019s nudity as just another part of their lives rather than a selling point. It can be argued that Cheer Boys!! specifically calls out Free! at one point. One of the latter's best-known scenes from Season 1 is of Rei stretching in a speedo while the \u201ccamera\u201d pans over his body in compromising positions. Episode 2 of Cheer Boys!! opens with a similar idea, where the team is practicing in a public area and Mizoguchi is moaning. The sounds and confused faces of passersby linger long enough to imply a sexual nature, but the next shot shows the audience that this isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening. In reality, Haru is helping Mizoguchi stretch beyond his normal range of movement. Haru even smacks the back of his head and tells him to stop making such weird noises.  On top of its trend-breaking stance on sports anime with male casts, Cheer Boys!! also takes a different stance on the genre in general. Taking place in college rather than high school is just the beginning of its differences from the average sports anime. While most series like it have the goal of going to the national competition or its equivalent, Cheer Boys!! takes a mature stance from the start. Most of the original team members choose cheerleading for reasons other than wanting to win a trophy or look cool. Kazu does it because he admires his cheerleader mom, Mizoguchi enjoys challenging himself with new activities and Tono joins in order to change himself as a person.  RELATED: Prince of Tennis II Releases New Teaser Trailer, Key Art                  While winning competitions is a goal down the line, the team's beginnings are humbler than most, starting with two former martial artists and a dream. The Breakers aren't titans with a reputation to uphold or fallen greats like many anime teams; they work with no support and become something worth watching. Even their name, Breakers, comes from a meaningful place. Kazu says he wants to break a lot of things, from the stereotype that cheerleading is for girls to his teammates\u2019 masks and doubts. The other boys agree and add what they want to break by joining this team.  The characters\u2019 lives outside of cheerleading are also prominent and become the source of problems. Cast members in sports anime largely occupy a few spaces: the court/field, or elsewhere in their school. All that matters is the sport -- until exam season rolls around and they have to scramble to get passing marks. It's rare that the characters have problems at home or anything else getting in the way of being an athlete. RELATED: Tribe Nine's Explosive, Bittersweet Finale Confirms the Series' Biggest Message This is not the case in Cheer Boys!!, where more situations have to be accommodated as the team grows. Members who are further along in their education regularly miss practice because they\u2019re job hunting, while others may have to skip because they can\u2019t afford to cut back on shifts at their part-time jobs. For those with the time to dedicate to cheer, especially Hisashi, it looks like they are simply slackers who don\u2019t take the sport seriously. The reality is vastly different.  Cheer Boys!! is far from a perfect anime. At times it weighs too heavily on slice-of-life elements for those looking for a pure sports anime, and the animation is average for 2016. However, its different perspective on sports as a genre makes it stand out. It's calm and mature where comparable series never lose momentum. Victory is a goal, but that isn't all the characters get out of participating. All the while, the story shows bits of where the cast will wind up once they get their degrees.

Within anime and manga, the sports genre is typically known for certain characteristics depending on the dominant sex making up the cast. Titles like Slam Dunk and Hajime no Ippo, which revolve around a boys team, are charged with energy and perform anime tropes while adhering closely to the reality of playing the sport. If the cast is a girls team, or even has a mixed team, the aim is typically fan service. Whether it\u2019s Welcome to the Ballroom joking that boys only start dancing to get close to girls or Keijo!!!!!!!! being about girls in bathing suits knocking each other into the water with their chests and butts, the focus is on their bodies and the male gaze.  Starting in the 2010s, however, the norms of sports anime were flipped as more \u201cmanservice\u201d series aired. For a short while, anime with all-male casts seemed to be trying to outdo each other on this front, so 2016's refreshingly calm Cheer Boys!! went largely unnoticed. At the time, the Free! franchise had peaked in popularity and the stage was set for titles like Yuri!!! on Ice and All Out!! to make their marks on the sports genre. Cheer Boys!!, however, went against the grain with its more mature, nuanced look at sports. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance \u2013 But It Isn't Necessary                   While its cast is absolutely one of pretty anime boys, the series doesn\u2019t rely on eye candy. Cheer Boys!! does show its boys in various states of undress, but it\u2019s done in a different way than the manservice shows of its time. Whether it be Haru examining his shoulder in the shower or the boys unwinding at a local bath house, the show's \u201ccamera\u201d never focuses on titillation. It handles the cast\u2019s nudity as just another part of their lives rather than a selling point. It can be argued that Cheer Boys!! specifically calls out Free! at one point. One of the latter's best-known scenes from Season 1 is of Rei stretching in a speedo while the \u201ccamera\u201d pans over his body in compromising positions. Episode 2 of Cheer Boys!! opens with a similar idea, where the team is practicing in a public area and Mizoguchi is moaning. The sounds and confused faces of passersby linger long enough to imply a sexual nature, but the next shot shows the audience that this isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening. In reality, Haru is helping Mizoguchi stretch beyond his normal range of movement. Haru even smacks the back of his head and tells him to stop making such weird noises.  On top of its trend-breaking stance on sports anime with male casts, Cheer Boys!! also takes a different stance on the genre in general. Taking place in college rather than high school is just the beginning of its differences from the average sports anime. While most series like it have the goal of going to the national competition or its equivalent, Cheer Boys!! takes a mature stance from the start. Most of the original team members choose cheerleading for reasons other than wanting to win a trophy or look cool. Kazu does it because he admires his cheerleader mom, Mizoguchi enjoys challenging himself with new activities and Tono joins in order to change himself as a person.  RELATED: Prince of Tennis II Releases New Teaser Trailer, Key Art                  While winning competitions is a goal down the line, the team's beginnings are humbler than most, starting with two former martial artists and a dream. The Breakers aren't titans with a reputation to uphold or fallen greats like many anime teams; they work with no support and become something worth watching. Even their name, Breakers, comes from a meaningful place. Kazu says he wants to break a lot of things, from the stereotype that cheerleading is for girls to his teammates\u2019 masks and doubts. The other boys agree and add what they want to break by joining this team.  The characters\u2019 lives outside of cheerleading are also prominent and become the source of problems. Cast members in sports anime largely occupy a few spaces: the court/field, or elsewhere in their school. All that matters is the sport -- until exam season rolls around and they have to scramble to get passing marks. It's rare that the characters have problems at home or anything else getting in the way of being an athlete. RELATED: Tribe Nine's Explosive, Bittersweet Finale Confirms the Series' Biggest Message This is not the case in Cheer Boys!!, where more situations have to be accommodated as the team grows. Members who are further along in their education regularly miss practice because they\u2019re job hunting, while others may have to skip because they can\u2019t afford to cut back on shifts at their part-time jobs. For those with the time to dedicate to cheer, especially Hisashi, it looks like they are simply slackers who don\u2019t take the sport seriously. The reality is vastly different.  Cheer Boys!! is far from a perfect anime. At times it weighs too heavily on slice-of-life elements for those looking for a pure sports anime, and the animation is average for 2016. However, its different perspective on sports as a genre makes it stand out. It's calm and mature where comparable series never lose momentum. Victory is a goal, but that isn't all the characters get out of participating. All the while, the story shows bits of where the cast will wind up once they get their degrees.

By Louis Kemner Published 12 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In the Science Fell in Love anime, Ayame is head over heels for Shinya - and one single moment inspired this infatuation.                 Returning for a second season in the Spring 2022 anime lineup, Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com series where the two main lovers use the power of real-life science to determine if they are truly in love or not. Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya have gotten in too deep to stop the experiment -- even if they're making fools of themselves. They have to find conclusive evidence, or else.  It's clear Ayame is deeply infatuated with the aloof Shinya, who is starting to return her feelings more and more. But some fans may not be clear on why she was drawn to him of all people in the first place. Ayame isn't just testing the scientific method for fun -- her feelings are genuine and it all started years in the past, when they first met. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen          When Shinya Empowered Ayame To Pursue Science                Ayame's strong feelings for Shinya are not a recent development. Neither of them realize it yet, but they have actually crossed paths in their childhood. It was a moment straight out of any slice-of-life anime, but with a science-oriented twist. In their younger days, both Shinya and Ayame were mocked and ostracized for their fixation on science and research, to the point other kids would doodle hurtful remarks on their backpacks.  The difference is that the young Shinya took it in stride and had self-confidence, while the unassertive Ayame felt terrible about her weak social life and external shame as an unpopular geek girl. Ayame suffered low self-esteem until she and Shinya met by chance in a sunlit forest, where they recognized each other as kindred spirits. Most importantly, Shinya, as an aloof kuudere, gave Ayame a pep talk to empower her without being overly affectionate about it. He set a good example for Ayame as a self-assured and hardworking young scientist who put his work first, making it clear that he derives his self-worth and motivation from making scientific discoveries -- similar to Dr. Stone's Senku. The young Ayame, dazzled by Shinya's example, was soon motivated to resume her work and make something of herself, no matter how much she was teased. Even if Shinya was teased too, he held his head high and pursued what he loved, which left a lasting impression on Ayame. Now she has met that inspiring boy scientist once again, but amusingly, neither recognizes the other from that shared memory. But other forces are at work in Science Fell in Love.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love: Meet the Main Cast of Characters          What Ayame's Amorous Feelings Say About Her                The relationship between Ayame and Shinya says a lot about both of them but more so about Ayame, whose romantic feelings were largely one-sided at first. In her childhood, she found Shinya inspiring not because he showed off and acted like a tough guy, but because he dived right into Ayame's heart and sought to soothe her insecurities. The young Shinya told Ayame exactly what she needed to hear with gentle, reassuring words, establishing him as a caring kuudere who cares little for flamboyant displays of masculinity.

Science Fell in Love: Why Did Ayame Originally Fall For Shinya?  By Louis Kemner Published 12 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   In the Science Fell in Love anime, Ayame is head over heels for Shinya - and one single moment inspired this infatuation.                 Returning for a second season in the Spring 2022 anime lineup, Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com series where the two main lovers use the power of real-life science to determine if they are truly in love or not. Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya have gotten in too deep to stop the experiment -- even if they're making fools of themselves. They have to find conclusive evidence, or else.  It's clear Ayame is deeply infatuated with the aloof Shinya, who is starting to return her feelings more and more. But some fans may not be clear on why she was drawn to him of all people in the first place. Ayame isn't just testing the scientific method for fun -- her feelings are genuine and it all started years in the past, when they first met. RELATED: How Science Fell in Love Became a Battle Shonen          When Shinya Empowered Ayame To Pursue Science                Ayame's strong feelings for Shinya are not a recent development. Neither of them realize it yet, but they have actually crossed paths in their childhood. It was a moment straight out of any slice-of-life anime, but with a science-oriented twist. In their younger days, both Shinya and Ayame were mocked and ostracized for their fixation on science and research, to the point other kids would doodle hurtful remarks on their backpacks.  The difference is that the young Shinya took it in stride and had self-confidence, while the unassertive Ayame felt terrible about her weak social life and external shame as an unpopular geek girl. Ayame suffered low self-esteem until she and Shinya met by chance in a sunlit forest, where they recognized each other as kindred spirits. Most importantly, Shinya, as an aloof kuudere, gave Ayame a pep talk to empower her without being overly affectionate about it. He set a good example for Ayame as a self-assured and hardworking young scientist who put his work first, making it clear that he derives his self-worth and motivation from making scientific discoveries -- similar to Dr. Stone's Senku. The young Ayame, dazzled by Shinya's example, was soon motivated to resume her work and make something of herself, no matter how much she was teased. Even if Shinya was teased too, he held his head high and pursued what he loved, which left a lasting impression on Ayame. Now she has met that inspiring boy scientist once again, but amusingly, neither recognizes the other from that shared memory. But other forces are at work in Science Fell in Love.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love: Meet the Main Cast of Characters          What Ayame's Amorous Feelings Say About Her                The relationship between Ayame and Shinya says a lot about both of them but more so about Ayame, whose romantic feelings were largely one-sided at first. In her childhood, she found Shinya inspiring not because he showed off and acted like a tough guy, but because he dived right into Ayame's heart and sought to soothe her insecurities. The young Shinya told Ayame exactly what she needed to hear with gentle, reassuring words, establishing him as a caring kuudere who cares little for flamboyant displays of masculinity. True, he is secure with his own manhood, but he's not the type who tries to pick up women or vainly show off his athletic prowess. Some girls like a bad boy such as that, but not Ayame. She would consider such things superficial, and so would Shinya for that matter.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend Instead, just like Horimiya's Miyamura Izumi, Shinya exudes a comforting and nurturing type of masculinity. That says much about Ayame's refined taste in men, as she evidently prefers partners who have those qualities rather than a star athlete build or a high alcohol tolerance in bars. Perhaps she always felt this way, or her first meeting with Shinya made such an impression that it redefined her taste in boys for years to come. Either way, Ayame's romantic preferences are set in stone by now, and Shinya would never impress her by acting like a boastful star athlete or by driving a muscle car. Not that he would try all that, anyway -- like Ayame, he is devoted to discovery, not vanity. That's an attractive trait in any partner, and it'll be fascinating to see how their relationship evolves as Season 2 of Science Fell in Love gets under way.

Are they right again in suggesting his Quirk makes him like a phoenix?                  This article contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 349, \"Battle Flame,\" by Kohei Horikoshi, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media.   Kohei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia is a perfect series for crafting theories. Pieces of the world and its characters are plenty interesting, yet it remains mysterious enough to keep fans guessing about where the story is or could go. Sometimes a widely accepted fan theory is even proved correct, like in 2020 when prominent villain Dabi confirmed that he is, in fact, the presumed-dead Todoroki Toya.  Since this confirmation, Dabi has been on a mission to reach his ultimate goal. He's burning hero society to the ground, literally, and is doing so without care for the damage his Quirk is causing his body. Many speculate that, if he continues at this rate, he'll be his own downfall. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 However, a theory that had long been dormant in the My Hero Academia fandom has surfaced once again. Hints of it can be traced to the time before Dabi's identity was revealed, but the additional information since then is adding to its probability. This theory, written in detail by Twitter user Tripol Tivoli in 2021, suggests that Dabi's Quirk has more to it than originally thought. Tivoli suggests it isn't simply a powerful flame emitter Quirk like Endeavor's, but that there's some kind of restorative ability attached to it -- like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  The legend of the phoenix, or of creatures similar to it, can be traced back to ancient civilizations around the world. The mythical bird is commonly associated with the sun -- due to its body of fire -- and rebirth. A common aspect of the phoenix's mythos is that its own fire is what kills it, only to reform from its destroyed body and live again. Dabi's Quirk affects him in a similar way in MHA. He cannot use it for long periods of time without burning himself. However, he has done so to a lethal extent at least once. In Chapter 291 of the MHA manga, it's stated that Toya's Quirk caused a devastating fire and only his lower jaw bone was found. Typically when pieces of a human skull are found, it's safe to presume its owner is deceased. It's hard to believe he'd survive as the source of the fire -- but if his Quirk functions like a phoenix, it's possible that he did.  RELATED: My Hero Academia: Dabi's Inevitable Defeat Is Due to All For One's Carelessness                 Dabi's alias, a reference to the Buddhist cremation ceremony of the same name, also supports this theory. In Buddhism, cremation is preferred because the physical body means little in the religion's beliefs. Since Buddhists believe in reincarnation, the body is nothing more than a vessel for one's soul and will not be needed in their next life. Some may think this is mere coincidence, but that goes against Horikoshi's process for creating his characters. He has stated on a bonus page in Volume 10 of the manga that he comes up with the Quirk first. The character's name comes next, followed by their design. Often, these decisions shape the character's role in the story and any growth they might experience. For example, Bakugo's quirk and strongest personality traits come from his surname, which is a play on the Japanese word for explosion. His given name, Katsuki, is made up of characters meaning \"to win\" and \"self.\" These allude to his obsession with victory, but also his journey throughout My Hero Academia to overcome his biggest enemy: himself.  With this in mind, Dabi's name being related to this specific cremation and the beliefs behind it can't be happenstance. He's even dressed in white for this battle, a color widely associated with funerals in Asian countries. This information, when added to the mythos of the phoenix, paints an interesting picture. Todoroki Toya is legally dead, yet there Dabi stands. This fight is going to be his grand exit -- be it by Shoto's hand or his own.

Are they right again in suggesting his Quirk makes him like a phoenix?                  This article contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 349, \"Battle Flame,\" by Kohei Horikoshi, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media.   Kohei Horikoshi's My Hero Academia is a perfect series for crafting theories. Pieces of the world and its characters are plenty interesting, yet it remains mysterious enough to keep fans guessing about where the story is or could go. Sometimes a widely accepted fan theory is even proved correct, like in 2020 when prominent villain Dabi confirmed that he is, in fact, the presumed-dead Todoroki Toya.  Since this confirmation, Dabi has been on a mission to reach his ultimate goal. He's burning hero society to the ground, literally, and is doing so without care for the damage his Quirk is causing his body. Many speculate that, if he continues at this rate, he'll be his own downfall. RELATED: MHA: The UA Traitor's Most Selfless Moment Hinted at Their Tragic Backstory                 However, a theory that had long been dormant in the My Hero Academia fandom has surfaced once again. Hints of it can be traced to the time before Dabi's identity was revealed, but the additional information since then is adding to its probability. This theory, written in detail by Twitter user Tripol Tivoli in 2021, suggests that Dabi's Quirk has more to it than originally thought. Tivoli suggests it isn't simply a powerful flame emitter Quirk like Endeavor's, but that there's some kind of restorative ability attached to it -- like a phoenix rising from the ashes.  The legend of the phoenix, or of creatures similar to it, can be traced back to ancient civilizations around the world. The mythical bird is commonly associated with the sun -- due to its body of fire -- and rebirth. A common aspect of the phoenix's mythos is that its own fire is what kills it, only to reform from its destroyed body and live again. Dabi's Quirk affects him in a similar way in MHA. He cannot use it for long periods of time without burning himself. However, he has done so to a lethal extent at least once. In Chapter 291 of the MHA manga, it's stated that Toya's Quirk caused a devastating fire and only his lower jaw bone was found. Typically when pieces of a human skull are found, it's safe to presume its owner is deceased. It's hard to believe he'd survive as the source of the fire -- but if his Quirk functions like a phoenix, it's possible that he did.  RELATED: My Hero Academia: Dabi's Inevitable Defeat Is Due to All For One's Carelessness                 Dabi's alias, a reference to the Buddhist cremation ceremony of the same name, also supports this theory. In Buddhism, cremation is preferred because the physical body means little in the religion's beliefs. Since Buddhists believe in reincarnation, the body is nothing more than a vessel for one's soul and will not be needed in their next life. Some may think this is mere coincidence, but that goes against Horikoshi's process for creating his characters. He has stated on a bonus page in Volume 10 of the manga that he comes up with the Quirk first. The character's name comes next, followed by their design. Often, these decisions shape the character's role in the story and any growth they might experience. For example, Bakugo's quirk and strongest personality traits come from his surname, which is a play on the Japanese word for explosion. His given name, Katsuki, is made up of characters meaning \"to win\" and \"self.\" These allude to his obsession with victory, but also his journey throughout My Hero Academia to overcome his biggest enemy: himself.  With this in mind, Dabi's name being related to this specific cremation and the beliefs behind it can't be happenstance. He's even dressed in white for this battle, a color widely associated with funerals in Asian countries. This information, when added to the mythos of the phoenix, paints an interesting picture. Todoroki Toya is legally dead, yet there Dabi stands. This fight is going to be his grand exit -- be it by Shoto's hand or his own.

This is the first time Terry will have to go solo without the voice of his mentor and friend guiding him. During the events of Batman: Urban Legends #7, published by DC Comics last year, Bruce's pacemaker overloads and kills him, but not before he gives Terry his blessings. An enraged Terry tears the city apart in search of the culprit, only to come back home to the Batcave and realize it was Gotham itself that killed Bruce.

Written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing with artwork from Max Dunbar and Sebastian Cheng and lettering by Aditya Bidikar, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 starts a new chapter for Batman.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 pits Terry McGinnis against the sentinel AI avatar of Gotham City. It has been two months since Neo-Gotham woke up and killed Bruce Wayne and two months since Terry started his solitary crusade against the criminal element. However, he is nowhere near cleansing the streets of crime or turning Gotham on his side. To add to the predicament, Bruce's other legacy, the Wayne-Powers corporation, is now run by a former crook, the Holographic Man.

RELATED: DC's Batman: Beyond the White Knight #1 Comic Review                 Terry McGinnis is at a crossroads in his life. With his mentor gone and the number of allies dwindling, Terry is trying hard to keep the peace in his city while desperately clamoring to keep Bruce's legacy intact. Loneliness has gripped him as Batman is spread thin over Gotham putting out fires. Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 envisions a different kind of Gotham, one that is aesthetically techno-modern but has transcended the barriers of technology and is now turning on its own citizens. The only person in its way is its sworn protector. A linear narrative with a heavy emphasis on its protagonist, the story progresses through Terry's point of view, using first-person narrative boxes to explore his inner feelings and resolve. The debut issue of this Batman Beyond reboot does well to provide exposition through character interactions. The action kicks up a notch in the latter half, with new adversaries rearing their heads.  Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 showcases a neon-lit, futuristic Gotham City filled with high-tech machinery and ultramodern urban architecture. Artist Max Dunbar uses crisp lines and elaborately detailed backgrounds to infuse the pages with animated energy that gives off a cartoonish vibe. To not take away from the seriousness of the plot, Dunbar employs a variety of techniques, from glaring close-ups to brooding panels. However, what catches the eye are the full-length splash pages that frame the characters, new and old, in their natural element. Meanwhile, the coloring best brings out the neo-futuristic aesthetic of the book. Colorist Sebastian Cheng's use of alternate tones of colors to create light and shadow gives depth to the artwork. Cheng douses the Gotham sky in an eternal shade of soothing purple, creating a great contrast with Batman's black and red.  RELATED: DC's Batman: Killing Time #2 Comic Review                 From the get-go, Batman Beyond: Neo-Year #1 never seems to let its foot off the gas, continuing the momentum and suspense that started in the pages of Batman: Urban Legends #7 all the while adding new flavors into the mix as the story progresses. A fan-favorite character, Terry McGinnis is at a rough spot in his life, and it is only going to get tougher. After years of listening to an old grumpy man's voice in his head, Terry has developed an unhealthy habit of speaking to an absent father figure.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for This Is Us Season 6, Episode 11, \"Saturday in the Park,\" which aired Tuesday, April 5 on NBC.Kevin Pearson is the only This Is Us sibling not married in the present timeline. The series has shown viewers that he will get married at some point in the future, though the identity of his wife has yet to be revealed. Season 6 has included the idea of Kevin revisiting his relationship with Cassidy Sharp, which has sparked discussion that she may be his spouse; however, instead of Kevin returning to an old flame and trying again, he ought to be given a new love interest altogether.  Kevin previously had a one-night stand with Cassidy, who in Season 6 is working for him by overseeing the construction of the Pearson family cabin. She is helping him realize his father Jack's dream of building the cabin and starting a construction company. They have two seasons of history and chemistry, so it makes sense that some This Is Us fans are hoping they end up together. However, it's best for both their sakes that they keep the platonic relationship they agreed upon. RELATED: This Is Us: What You Need To Know About Cassidy                 Kevin has grown considerably over the course of the series, particularly during Season 6; he's made the most positive change out of any of the main characters. His moments of rash decision-making and poor judgment genuinely seem to be behind him after how he handled his complicated relationship with Madison in Season 6, Episode 11, \"Saturday in the Park.\" He learns that Madison's new boyfriend Eli is planning on proposing to her, and while the news does affect him, he handles the situation completely differently than he would have before.  The old Kevin would have sabotaged things for Madison and Eli and ruined the unique dynamic he has with Madison as co-parents to their twins. Instead, the new Kevin lets her go, so they can both move on. That decision was a step away from his past and the numerous relationship failures that were part of it. RELATED: This Is Us Suggests [Spoiler] Isn't the Villain in Kate\u2019s Life Anymore                 Cassidy may be compatibke with Kevin, but she's still part of his past, and he no longer needs to be looking backward. Season 6 has finally put him in a good, healthy position to meet someone new and take a step forward in his life. Introducing a new character for Kevin to fall in love with and get married to would continue the character's positive development as viewers approach the end of the series.  There's still plenty of time for This Is Us to introduce Kevin's future wife. Kevin's never struggled with romantic gestures or anything like that; he's needed to settle down and focus on the smaller things. Any courtship between him and his future wife wouldn't have to be a very long arc since he gets involved in relationships fairly easily. Cassidy also deserves a fresh start, and her friendship with Kevin could be the thing that helps her rebuild; the series shouldn't upset that just to pair them together romantically again. Both characters deserve more, and they can still be great friends even if they don't end up together.  With only seven episodes left, Kevin's wife on This Is Us will be revealed soon. Find out who she is by watching the final season Tuesdays on NBC.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for This Is Us Season 6, Episode 11, \"Saturday in the Park,\" which aired Tuesday, April 5 on NBC.Kevin Pearson is the only This Is Us sibling not married in the present timeline. The series has shown viewers that he will get married at some point in the future, though the identity of his wife has yet to be revealed. Season 6 has included the idea of Kevin revisiting his relationship with Cassidy Sharp, which has sparked discussion that she may be his spouse; however, instead of Kevin returning to an old flame and trying again, he ought to be given a new love interest altogether.  Kevin previously had a one-night stand with Cassidy, who in Season 6 is working for him by overseeing the construction of the Pearson family cabin. She is helping him realize his father Jack's dream of building the cabin and starting a construction company. They have two seasons of history and chemistry, so it makes sense that some This Is Us fans are hoping they end up together. However, it's best for both their sakes that they keep the platonic relationship they agreed upon. RELATED: This Is Us: What You Need To Know About Cassidy                 Kevin has grown considerably over the course of the series, particularly during Season 6; he's made the most positive change out of any of the main characters. His moments of rash decision-making and poor judgment genuinely seem to be behind him after how he handled his complicated relationship with Madison in Season 6, Episode 11, \"Saturday in the Park.\" He learns that Madison's new boyfriend Eli is planning on proposing to her, and while the news does affect him, he handles the situation completely differently than he would have before.  The old Kevin would have sabotaged things for Madison and Eli and ruined the unique dynamic he has with Madison as co-parents to their twins. Instead, the new Kevin lets her go, so they can both move on. That decision was a step away from his past and the numerous relationship failures that were part of it. RELATED: This Is Us Suggests [Spoiler] Isn't the Villain in Kate\u2019s Life Anymore                 Cassidy may be compatibke with Kevin, but she's still part of his past, and he no longer needs to be looking backward. Season 6 has finally put him in a good, healthy position to meet someone new and take a step forward in his life. Introducing a new character for Kevin to fall in love with and get married to would continue the character's positive development as viewers approach the end of the series.  There's still plenty of time for This Is Us to introduce Kevin's future wife. Kevin's never struggled with romantic gestures or anything like that; he's needed to settle down and focus on the smaller things. Any courtship between him and his future wife wouldn't have to be a very long arc since he gets involved in relationships fairly easily. Cassidy also deserves a fresh start, and her friendship with Kevin could be the thing that helps her rebuild; the series shouldn't upset that just to pair them together romantically again.

By Daniel McMahon Published 14 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Ken Kaneki's hair changes color multiple times throughout the Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re manga. There are two reasons that explain this.            T     Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoul:re follow the life of Ken Kaneki/Haise Sasaki as he is transformed into a ghoul in a freak surgical operation and construction accident. One puzzling aspect of the series is why Kaneiki's hair changes color over the course of the two series and why the author puts such effort into this detail.  There are two reasons why Kaneki's/Sasaki's hair changes color throughout the series. The first reason is direct and explicitly stated, while the other has metaphorical reasoning behind it, requiring the audience to pick up the pieces laid before them. RELATED: The Quietest Anime Shows Typically Have a Lot to Say Ghouls are an exclusively carnivorous and cannibalistic human species that can only feed off of either human or ghoul flesh. Feeding on humans is required once a month as going without it causes severe mental deterioration. A ghoul that goes into extreme starvation eventually loses cognition of everything around them, only seeing the rest of the world as a potential meal. In the case of Rize Kamishiro, being starved by Dr. Kano resulted in her mind being reverted to that of an animal. Consuming only ghouls manages to stave off the hunger temporarily; however, mental deterioration is inevitable.  As seen with Kaneki in the latter half of the Tokyo Ghoul manga, consuming only ghouls caused him to think more erratically, use his kagune less cautiously and isolate himself from his friends at Anteiku. Ghouls have an abnormally high amount of \"RC cells\" that they acquire from eating humans and ghouls and then store in a special ghoul-exclusive organ called the \"kakuho.\" Ghouls are able to freely manipulate the density and flexibility of RC cells, allowing them to release the cells from their skin and use them as weapons or limbs. This release of RC cells from the body is called a kagune, of which there are four subdivisions: Ukaku, Rinkaku, Bikaku and Kokaku. Failing to eat human flesh results in a lack of available RC cells, making the user's kagune weaker.                  Besides consuming human and ghoul flesh, there is another way to strengthen the kagune and bolster RC production. To do this, one must experience a plethora of physical pain. Similar to the Sharingan from Naruto, the more pain one endures, the stronger they become. Whether it be from torture or brutal exercise, the damage one receives strengthens the kakuho by increasing the number of cellular tubes that allow for RC cells to be released. This, in turn, creates a positive feedback loop. By enduring pain, the kakuho becomes stronger and a ghoul is able to endure more pain. This positive feedback loop serves to make a ghoul stronger in the long term.  RELATED: The Differences Between Ishvalans in Fullmetal Alchemist and Brotherhood Kaneki was permanently traumatized by many people in his life, but they're all insignificant when compared to the impact Yakumo Oomori, nicknamed \"Yamori,\" had on him. In a game to \"break the One-Eyed,\" Yamori set about to permanently traumatize Kaneki by torturing him the same way Yamori was once tortured by the CCG. Kaneki is forced to count backward from 1,000 in intervals of seven to keep Kaneki sane and prevent disassociation while the torture progresses. Taking advantage of Kaneki's remarkable healing capabilities, Yamori would clip each one of Kaneki's digits off with metal pliers. He also would routinely cut off Kaneki's arms and legs to watch them grow back like fingernails. When Yamori had to leave, he would place a red-headed Chinese centipede into Kaneki's ear to tunnel around and cause him incomparable anguish.                 An important result of Yamori's torture is the unintended consequence of strengthening Kaneki. By repeatedly cutting off and breaking Kaneki's limbs, Yamori had inadvertently strengthened Kaneki's kagune to far surpass his own. The torture resulted in Kaneki's hair changing from black to white because of the increase in cellular tubes in his RC cells in his kakuho, thus increasing his own RC cell count. However, there also remains the metaphorical reason that Kaneki's hair changes color: the loss of his purity. Whenever Kaneki's innocence is irreparably damaged, his RC count spikes and his hair turns white, as seen on two occasions in both the original series and Tokyo Ghoul:re. The foremost example of this is shown when Yamori tortured Kaneki for multiple days, as his hair color is seen to change from panel to panel in Tokyo Ghoul, Chapter 61, \"Glimmer.\" He walked into Yamori's torture chamber with dark black hair, and his hair soon lost all pigment during the torture. Following Yamori's torture, Kaneki became a completely different person desperate to protect everyone around him. His hair color denoting his innocence is reinforced in the first chapter of Tokyo Ghoul:re.  RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul                 Utilizing the \"tabula rasa\" trope, in Tokyo Ghoul:re, Kaneki's mind was wiped clean, and he began a new identity as Haise Sasaki working at the CCG. The most notable physical difference in Sasaki's appearance is that his hair is primarily black while the tips remain white. This alone tells the audience that Sasaki's initial RC count is significantly lower than when his identity was Kaneki. The literal answer as to why his hair regained its complexion is because Sasaki was required by the CCG to take RC suppressants.  As the name implies, RC suppressants suppress the RC cells that ghouls can access, thus impairing their kagune, regenerative abilities and thick skin. An unintentional side effect of RC suppressants is that it also temporarily increases melanin production in the hair, thereby giving back Sasaki his dark hair. As Sasaki slowly comes to terms with his former identity as Kaneki, he is also given the leeway of not having to take as many RC suppressants. Thus, as the series progresses, his hair slowly loses its color once again. The metaphorical answer of \"a reflection of innocence\" for why Kaneki's hair changes color also applies in Tokyo Ghoul:re. When Sasaki has no memory of his former life as Kaneki and his innocence is at its height during the beginning of Tokyo Ghoul:re, his hair is almost black, with small patches of white at the tips. Sasaki's hair is a clear metaphor for his innocence, with the darkness of Kaneki being locked away in the corners of his mind and manifesting as white tips in his hair.  RELATED:  Tokyo Ghoul Creator Shares Fan Art of Olympic Skater Yuzuru Hanyu During Sasaki's lowest point following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation, his personality becomes cold and compassionless. In an attempt to protect himself from being hurt, he isolates himself from the rest of the Q squad and temporarily regains his innocence. This is proven by his hair turning completely black following the Tsukiyama Family Extermination Operation.                  During the Rishima Landing Operation, Sasaki is informed by Eto Yoshimura that the CCG has a darker history than it lets on and has ghouls running the organization. Sasaki rallies his resolve and then releases all the ghouls in Cochlea ranking S and below in the incipience of what would become known as the Second Cochlea Raid. During the Second Cochlea Raid, Sasaki's hair once again adopts a uniform white complexion, indicating his repeated loss of innocence.

The hacking incident that caused delays in the production of One Piece and Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero was a targeted ransomware attack.  As reported by the NHK, Toei Animation was the target of a ransomware virus that was uploaded onto the studio's private network and servers. Ransomware attacks, especially on large corporations, have become commonplace in the last several years. The viruses work by encrypting or copying key files on company computers or servers, after which the creators of the ransomware then demand a pay-off from their targets in order to remove the encryption or stop those files from being leaked online. The report does not state if Toei paid the ransom, but it does note that the company shut down its internal networks to confirm the existence of the virus and the extent of the damage it had caused.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super Reveals Gotenks' Surprising New Look Toei Animation originally announced on March 6 that its networks were breached by \"an unauthorized third party\" and that production on several of its biggest projects would be delayed as a result. Several of its most popular anime series, including One Piece, Digimon: Ghost Game, and Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, postponed the release of new episodes and were forced to air rerurns for over a month. The producers of One Piece and Digimon recently announced that they were finally ready to begin broadcasting new episodes on April 17, more than six weeks after those episodes were originally scheduled to air. Crunchyroll has confirmed that it will resume streaming the simulcast of these series' new episodes internationally.  As of the writing of this article, a new premiere date has not been announced for Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the latest movie in the long-running shonen franchise. The highly-anticipated film, which is the first movie in the series to be animated entirely using CG, was originally scheduled to be released in Japan on April 22, with a North American premiere following sometime during the summer. The movie's release was indefinitely postponed following the cyber attack, and while Toei has yet to announce a new premiere date, a recent listing for the movie's novelizations suggests that it may now premiere in Japan sometime next June.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Novelizations May Reveal New Premiere Date for Movie Toei is not the only entertainment company to have been the target of this type of hack; most famously, Sony Pictures was the target of a ransomware attack in 2014, in which the hackers reportedly seized over 100 terabytes of private files from the studio. The hackers eventually leaked some of the information they copied and demanded that Sony cancel the release of The Interview, a Seth Rogen comedy about North Korea. Sony eventually did cancel the movie's theatrical run, but released the movie directly through digital distribution services.

The hacking incident that caused delays in the production of One Piece and Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero was a targeted ransomware attack.  As reported by the NHK, Toei Animation was the target of a ransomware virus that was uploaded onto the studio's private network and servers. Ransomware attacks, especially on large corporations, have become commonplace in the last several years. The viruses work by encrypting or copying key files on company computers or servers, after which the creators of the ransomware then demand a pay-off from their targets in order to remove the encryption or stop those files from being leaked online. The report does not state if Toei paid the ransom, but it does note that the company shut down its internal networks to confirm the existence of the virus and the extent of the damage it had caused.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super Reveals Gotenks' Surprising New Look Toei Animation originally announced on March 6 that its networks were breached by \"an unauthorized third party\" and that production on several of its biggest projects would be delayed as a result. Several of its most popular anime series, including One Piece, Digimon: Ghost Game, and Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai, postponed the release of new episodes and were forced to air rerurns for over a month. The producers of One Piece and Digimon recently announced that they were finally ready to begin broadcasting new episodes on April 17, more than six weeks after those episodes were originally scheduled to air. Crunchyroll has confirmed that it will resume streaming the simulcast of these series' new episodes internationally.  As of the writing of this article, a new premiere date has not been announced for Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, the latest movie in the long-running shonen franchise. The highly-anticipated film, which is the first movie in the series to be animated entirely using CG, was originally scheduled to be released in Japan on April 22, with a North American premiere following sometime during the summer. The movie's release was indefinitely postponed following the cyber attack, and while Toei has yet to announce a new premiere date, a recent listing for the movie's novelizations suggests that it may now premiere in Japan sometime next June.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Novelizations May Reveal New Premiere Date for Movie Toei is not the only entertainment company to have been the target of this type of hack; most famously, Sony Pictures was the target of a ransomware attack in 2014, in which the hackers reportedly seized over 100 terabytes of private files from the studio. The hackers eventually leaked some of the information they copied and demanded that Sony cancel the release of The Interview, a Seth Rogen comedy about North Korea. Sony eventually did cancel the movie's theatrical run, but released the movie directly through digital distribution services.

The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   The Colossal Titan is one of the most powerful creatures on Attack on Titan. Standing at least 50 meters high, they can lay waste to anything and everything in their path. The only thing that can beat them in either height or power is the Founding Titan -- and even that's somewhat debatable. However, it's exactly because of their size that they have some major weaknesses, especially when it comes to speed.  As powerful as the Colossal Titan is, it can't move its massive body around all that quickly. This much about it was made readily apparent as far back as Season 1. However, the latest episode of The Final Season provided a solution, albeit a temporary one. It turns out that Colossal Titans are unbelievably fearsome when submerged underwater. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                  The solution was presented in Episode 87, \"The Dawn of Humanity, in which the nations of the world combined their military force into one massive fleet in order to stop the Rumbling. Their goal was to blast the Colossal Titans out of the water before they could make landfall.  At first, the plan seemed to work. With an impressive round of cannon fire, they were able to blow several Titans to pieces, which then sank to the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, this resistance only made matters worse. In response to the fleet's bombardment, the Colossal Titans began moving even faster through the water. Suddenly, these hulking masses of human flesh were moving like torpedoes, which is certainly alarming given their size. A few of them were still hit by the cannon fire, but many of them managed to get through, RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                   The real destruction began as the Colossal titans were passing the fleet. First, the intense steam emitted from the behemoths burned the crews of the ships to a crisp. Not only that, but the steam was apparently so forceful that it sent the fleet flying into the air all at once. These Titans were presumably out of their element, yet they were still able to make quick work of such a massive collection of warships. As powerful as the Titans are on land, it seems as if they're at their most dangerous while swimming. Not only are they hard to hit while underwater, but they can move at a frighteningly fast pace as the need arises. Even when completely submerged, they can still kill their enemies with just their body heat. In water, the Colossal Titan becomes the most powerful creature on the planet by far.

The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll.   The Colossal Titan is one of the most powerful creatures on Attack on Titan. Standing at least 50 meters high, they can lay waste to anything and everything in their path. The only thing that can beat them in either height or power is the Founding Titan -- and even that's somewhat debatable. However, it's exactly because of their size that they have some major weaknesses, especially when it comes to speed.  As powerful as the Colossal Titan is, it can't move its massive body around all that quickly. This much about it was made readily apparent as far back as Season 1. However, the latest episode of The Final Season provided a solution, albeit a temporary one. It turns out that Colossal Titans are unbelievably fearsome when submerged underwater. RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2's Biggest Unanswered Questions                  The solution was presented in Episode 87, \"The Dawn of Humanity, in which the nations of the world combined their military force into one massive fleet in order to stop the Rumbling. Their goal was to blast the Colossal Titans out of the water before they could make landfall.  At first, the plan seemed to work. With an impressive round of cannon fire, they were able to blow several Titans to pieces, which then sank to the bottom of the ocean. Unfortunately, this resistance only made matters worse. In response to the fleet's bombardment, the Colossal Titans began moving even faster through the water. Suddenly, these hulking masses of human flesh were moving like torpedoes, which is certainly alarming given their size. A few of them were still hit by the cannon fire, but many of them managed to get through, RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important                   The real destruction began as the Colossal titans were passing the fleet. First, the intense steam emitted from the behemoths burned the crews of the ships to a crisp. Not only that, but the steam was apparently so forceful that it sent the fleet flying into the air all at once. These Titans were presumably out of their element, yet they were still able to make quick work of such a massive collection of warships. As powerful as the Titans are on land, it seems as if they're at their most dangerous while swimming. Not only are they hard to hit while underwater, but they can move at a frighteningly fast pace as the need arises. Even when completely submerged, they can still kill their enemies with just their body heat. In water, the Colossal Titan becomes the most powerful creature on the planet by far.

Lupin the Third Part 6 is coming to Toonami.  The programming block announced on its official FaceBook page that newest season of Lupin the Third will be joining its lineup on April 16. The show will air in the 1:30 A.M. Saturday night/ Sunday morning timeslot that was previously occupied by Made in Abyss, which will air its season finale on April 9. Lupin the Third Part 6 was originally broadcast in Japan from October 2021 \u2013 March 2022, and was simulcast exclusively on Sentai Filmworks' HIDIVE streaming service. RELATED: Entire Lupin the Third TV Series Is Now Available to Stream Lupin the Third Part 6 was first announced as part of the series' 50th anniversary celebration and marks the anime's return to TMS Animation, the studio that handled production of the series from 1971 \u2013 2015. The season is also notable for featuring the last episode starring the final member of the original Lupin the Third voice cast, Kiyoshi Kobayashi, who provided the voice of Jigen for the past 50 years. Kobayashi retired from acting in 2021 and voiced Lupin's most trusted partner-in-crime one last time for Part 6's first episode. The role was then passed on to actor Akio Otsuka, a veteran voice actor who is best known for providing the Japanese voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video game series and for his role as the heroic All Might in the popular My Hero Academia shonen anime.  Lupin the Third was created by manga artist Monkey Punch and was first published in 1967. The character of Lupin the Third is meant to be the grandchild of the famed literary thief Arsene Lupin, who was created in 1905 by French author Maurice LeBlanc. The series is widely regarded as one of the most influential anime and manga franchises of all time, as it helped to launch the directorial career of Hayao Miyazaki and served as a direct influence on numerous other works, including Shinichiro Watanabe's Cowboy Bebop. RELATED: It's Time for Mystery Anime to Retire Sherlock Holmes Toonami has been constantly refreshing its lineup with new shows since the start of 2022. In addition to the previously mentioned Made in Abyss, the programming block has also added several other critically-acclaimed hits to its schedule in recent months, including Assassination Classroom, Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2, and the return of One Piece to network TV. Toonami recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, during which it announced that it was producing two new seasons of the cult-classic anime FLCL.

Home Video Games LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Has an Easter Egg Honoring... Xenoblade?!    LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Has an Easter Egg Honoring... Xenoblade?!  By Constantine Morgus Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga's Xenoblade reference adds to the overall excitement and has fans wondering about other potential tributes.                 LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is one of the many highly anticipated games that has been in the making for several long years. Despite TT Games' unexpected announcement that its latest entry would not feature character customization, fans of the LEGO Star Wars franchise have quickly taken a shine to some of its content shortly after the release. Reimaginings of Star Wars' iconic moments and signature LEGO humor have left the internet abuzz, while interesting Easter eggs honoring other idiosyncratic series, such as Xenoblade Chronicles, have not gone unnoticed.  As an interactive medium that strives to expand its influence beyond the parent theme, video games often feature references that are not always in line with their respective setting. While some draw inspiration from historical events that shape the game's overworld or general gameplay, others pay tribute through carefully placed Easter eggs. Hidden areas, quirky one-liners, limited events or unique in-game items are commonly seen as the best way to communicate the envisioned homage, and developers utilize them without fail. RELATED: A Modern LEGO Racers Reboot Could Work - Here's How                  What makes the newly discovered Xenoblade reference unique in The Skywalker Saga is its timely incorporation and the fact that it can be easily overlooked. Exploring the Return of the Jedi portion of the game will eventually lead the players to Jabba's Palace. Within it, a disco party seems to be underway, and a titular Disco Director is eager to share his thoughts on the event should the players wish to interact with him. He expresses his enthusiasm for the ongoing party by saying, \"I'm really feeling it!\"  The statement in and of itself would not garner much attention, as it does not seem out of place, given the NPC's vocation and the matter at hand. However, the ambiguously referential line left fans wondering whether its placement was intentional because of Adam Howden's involvement. It was soon confirmed that Disco Director's sentiment was, in fact, a direct reference to Shulk and Xenoblade Chronicles. Adam Howden, the voice of Disco Director in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, is better known for his role as the voice behind Shulk in the Xenoblade series and Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. A former TT Games developer, David Harris, saw the opportunity to sneak in the uncanny Easter egg while he was working on his last puzzle in The Skywalker Saga. Despite the initial weariness Howden felt when he saw the line, he delivered it masterfully after being told it was a homage to Xenoblade.  RELATED: How Square's Most Iconic JRPG Evolved Into Nintendo's Xenoblade Chronicles                 While the tribute pays respects to the Xenoblade franchise through Shulk's watchword, the catchphrase itself does not originate from it. Before being incorporated into the Xenoblade games and becoming a part of Shulk's identity, the line was used as an introduction for his Super Smash Bros. appearance. Though it was originally intended for Shulk's character reveal trailer, the line unexpectedly took off, turning into a well-known meme within the community and eventually making its way to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as one of Shulk's taunts.  With the release of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, players have ample opportunity to discover a wide range of memorable Star Wars locations, landmarks and fully explore areas rich in random encounters. It will be interesting to see what other hidden gems and Easter eggs TT Games has in store for its fans in the latest LEGO installment and how they potentially tie in with other major franchises.

Xenoblade?!    LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga Has an Easter Egg Honoring... Xenoblade?!  By Constantine Morgus Published 1 day ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga's Xenoblade reference adds to the overall excitement and has fans wondering about other potential tributes.                 LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is one of the many highly anticipated games that has been in the making for several long years. Despite TT Games' unexpected announcement that its latest entry would not feature character customization, fans of the LEGO Star Wars franchise have quickly taken a shine to some of its content shortly after the release. Reimaginings of Star Wars' iconic moments and signature LEGO humor have left the internet abuzz, while interesting Easter eggs honoring other idiosyncratic series, such as Xenoblade Chronicles, have not gone unnoticed.  As an interactive medium that strives to expand its influence beyond the parent theme, video games often feature references that are not always in line with their respective setting. While some draw inspiration from historical events that shape the game's overworld or general gameplay, others pay tribute through carefully placed Easter eggs. Hidden areas, quirky one-liners, limited events or unique in-game items are commonly seen as the best way to communicate the envisioned homage, and developers utilize them without fail. RELATED: A Modern LEGO Racers Reboot Could Work - Here's How                  What makes the newly discovered Xenoblade reference unique in The Skywalker Saga is its timely incorporation and the fact that it can be easily overlooked. Exploring the Return of the Jedi portion of the game will eventually lead the players to Jabba's Palace. Within it, a disco party seems to be underway, and a titular Disco Director is eager to share his thoughts on the event should the players wish to interact with him. He expresses his enthusiasm for the ongoing party by saying, \"I'm really feeling it!\"  The statement in and of itself would not garner much attention, as it does not seem out of place, given the NPC's vocation and the matter at hand. However, the ambiguously referential line left fans wondering whether its placement was intentional because of Adam Howden's involvement. It was soon confirmed that Disco Director's sentiment was, in fact, a direct reference to Shulk and Xenoblade Chronicles. Adam Howden, the voice of Disco Director in LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, is better known for his role as the voice behind Shulk in the Xenoblade series and Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. A former TT Games developer, David Harris, saw the opportunity to sneak in the uncanny Easter egg while he was working on his last puzzle in The Skywalker Saga. Despite the initial weariness Howden felt when he saw the line, he delivered it masterfully after being told it was a homage to Xenoblade.  RELATED: How Square's Most Iconic JRPG Evolved Into Nintendo's Xenoblade Chronicles                 While the tribute pays respects to the Xenoblade franchise through Shulk's watchword, the catchphrase itself does not originate from it. Before being incorporated into the Xenoblade games and becoming a part of Shulk's identity, the line was used as an introduction for his Super Smash Bros. appearance. Though it was originally intended for Shulk's character reveal trailer, the line unexpectedly took off, turning into a well-known meme within the community and eventually making its way to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as one of Shulk's taunts.  With the release of LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, players have ample opportunity to discover a wide range of memorable Star Wars locations, landmarks and fully explore areas rich in random encounters. It will be interesting to see what other hidden gems and Easter eggs TT Games has in store for its fans in the latest LEGO installment and how they potentially tie in with other major franchises.

Chris Pine Is Right, Star Trek Isn't Marvel - But Then How Can It Survive in Theaters?  By Robert Vaux Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Star Trek has always aimed for more personal movies and lowered sights at the box office. Changing that could be a mistake.                 Actor Chris Pine made waves recently when speaking to Deadline magazine about his return to the Star Trek franchise. He lamented the studio\u2019s push for chasing the kind of billion-dollar box office figures routinely enjoyed by the likes of Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It wasn't necessarily a criticism. Rather, he simply noted that Star Trek is a different entity than either of those franchises and requires a different approach. He\u2019s not wrong. Beyond their respective success and a loosely shared genre, they have less in common than it may seem.  That\u2019s especially true for theatrical films, which Pine\u2019s Kelvinverse has been the caretaker of for Star Trek since 2009, and which are undergoing a radical, perhaps permanent change. Star Trek isn\u2019t necessarily the best fit for theaters, owing both to its very dedicated fan base and its origins in television rather than film. Trying to match the MCU or Star Wars for sheer box office figures won\u2019t work. More importantly, it won\u2019t be good for Star Trek. RELATED: Chris Pine Says Star Trek Shouldn't Compete With Marvel's 'Billion-Dollar' Movies                 Franchises are rapidly becoming the best way to stay competitive in Hollywood. The unparalleled success of the MCU and continued viability of Star Wars on the big screen have proven it, and along with DC, Star Trek and perhaps James Bond, they constitute the biggest and most durable examples currently on the market. That\u2019s made them seemingly impervious to the decline in theatrical attendance. Spider-Man: No Way Home and The Batman have both rung up impressive box office figures in the face of a post-COVID environment. Similarly, Star Wars released one of the last blockbusters before the pandemic began with Star Wars: Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker.  The Kelvinverse is Star Trek\u2019s natural response to that. When the Star Trek movie reboot first arrived in 2009, the franchise had laid fallow for several years and was in danger of closing up shop. The trilogy proved successful \u2013 as well as providing Leonard Nimoy\u2019s final onscreen appearances as Mr. Spock \u2013 and 2016\u2019s Star Trek Beyond passed the baton to Star Trek: Discovery, which premiered a year later. If the franchise wants to return to big-screen films, the Kelvinverse is clearly the most reliable means to do so. And yet, Pine\u2019s words suggest that setting the bar too high goes against the things that make Star Trek so appealing to the fans. Star Trek Beyond was labeled a box office underperformer, despite a healthy $340 million worldwide gross against a $180 million budget. That\u2019s less than half of No Way Home\u2019s take, and yet the changes required to keep pace with that amount would end up destroying the results rather than improving them. The franchise has had to learn that the hard way.  RELATED: Star Trek: The Motion Picture Remaster Reforges the Movie\u2019s Legacy                 Star Wars and the MCU are both cinematic creations: born on the big screen and readily adapted to the kinds of storytelling that feature films tell exceptionally well. Both include heaping amounts of spectacle as part of their formula and stress the benefits of viewing their effects-laden action scenes on the biggest screen one can find. As cinema attendance has dropped, both shifted to television \u2013 and found success there, particularly the various Disney+ streaming shows \u2013 but they remain rooted in movie theater sensibilities. Star Trek approached things from the opposite direction. It began on television, and while it aimed for high-end effects and a grand scope, its storytelling was still crafted for the small screen. That meant an emphasis on individuals and single circumstances rather than the larger sweeping epics that other franchises aimed for.  That caused the franchise considerable problems when it first made the leap to the big screen. Star Trek: The Motion Picture underperformed at the box office and was rightfully criticized for losing track of the crew amid all the spectacle. That happened in part because it was pursuing Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope, which had shattered recorded two years earlier but whose operatic space fantasy began with the big screen in mind. In order to thrive in the multiplexes, Star Trek had to lower its sights. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan cut its budget severely \u2013 down to $11 million, which was less than a third of the first film\u2019s expenses \u2013 but made only slightly less money. More importantly, it kept the focus on the actors, who were cheaper than effects, and Trek fans responded accordingly. That formula has worked for the remainder of the franchise\u2019s big-screen films, but the returns have always been similar. 2009\u2019s Star Trek remains the highest-grossing Trek movie, with $257 million in domestic receipts.  To push past that in an effort to essentially double the gross would be a disastrous move. The Motion Picture discovered that to its detriment, and the franchise learned those lessons well. The impact of COVID on movie theater attendance has only enhanced those conditions, such that expecting Star Trek to perform on a heretofore unseen level misses both the history and the key appeal that made it a success in the first place. In the meantime, it\u2019s thriving on streaming services as never before, with five successful series currently in production and more on the way. That\u2019s the screen it was built for, and while the Kelvinverse can continue to do well in movie theaters, it means seriously rethinking what success in that format means.

Chris Pine Is Right, Star Trek Isn't Marvel - But Then How Can It Survive in Theaters?  By Robert Vaux Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Star Trek has always aimed for more personal movies and lowered sights at the box office. Changing that could be a mistake.                 Actor Chris Pine made waves recently when speaking to Deadline magazine about his return to the Star Trek franchise. He lamented the studio\u2019s push for chasing the kind of billion-dollar box office figures routinely enjoyed by the likes of Star Wars or the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It wasn't necessarily a criticism. Rather, he simply noted that Star Trek is a different entity than either of those franchises and requires a different approach. He\u2019s not wrong. Beyond their respective success and a loosely shared genre, they have less in common than it may seem.  That\u2019s especially true for theatrical films, which Pine\u2019s Kelvinverse has been the caretaker of for Star Trek since 2009, and which are undergoing a radical, perhaps permanent change. Star Trek isn\u2019t necessarily the best fit for theaters, owing both to its very dedicated fan base and its origins in television rather than film. Trying to match the MCU or Star Wars for sheer box office figures won\u2019t work. More importantly, it won\u2019t be good for Star Trek. RELATED: Chris Pine Says Star Trek Shouldn't Compete With Marvel's 'Billion-Dollar' Movies                 Franchises are rapidly becoming the best way to stay competitive in Hollywood. The unparalleled success of the MCU and continued viability of Star Wars on the big screen have proven it, and along with DC, Star Trek and perhaps James Bond, they constitute the biggest and most durable examples currently on the market. That\u2019s made them seemingly impervious to the decline in theatrical attendance. Spider-Man: No Way Home and The Batman have both rung up impressive box office figures in the face of a post-COVID environment. Similarly, Star Wars released one of the last blockbusters before the pandemic began with Star Wars: Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker.  The Kelvinverse is Star Trek\u2019s natural response to that. When the Star Trek movie reboot first arrived in 2009, the franchise had laid fallow for several years and was in danger of closing up shop. The trilogy proved successful \u2013 as well as providing Leonard Nimoy\u2019s final onscreen appearances as Mr. Spock \u2013 and 2016\u2019s Star Trek Beyond passed the baton to Star Trek: Discovery, which premiered a year later. If the franchise wants to return to big-screen films, the Kelvinverse is clearly the most reliable means to do so. And yet, Pine\u2019s words suggest that setting the bar too high goes against the things that make Star Trek so appealing to the fans. Star Trek Beyond was labeled a box office underperformer, despite a healthy $340 million worldwide gross against a $180 million budget. That\u2019s less than half of No Way Home\u2019s take, and yet the changes required to keep pace with that amount would end up destroying the results rather than improving them. The franchise has had to learn that the hard way.  RELATED: Star Trek: The Motion Picture Remaster Reforges the Movie\u2019s Legacy                 Star Wars and the MCU are both cinematic creations: born on the big screen and readily adapted to the kinds of storytelling that feature films tell exceptionally well. Both include heaping amounts of spectacle as part of their formula and stress the benefits of viewing their effects-laden action scenes on the biggest screen one can find. As cinema attendance has dropped, both shifted to television \u2013 and found success there, particularly the various Disney+ streaming shows \u2013 but they remain rooted in movie theater sensibilities. Star Trek approached things from the opposite direction. It began on television, and while it aimed for high-end effects and a grand scope, its storytelling was still crafted for the small screen. That meant an emphasis on individuals and single circumstances rather than the larger sweeping epics that other franchises aimed for.  That caused the franchise considerable problems when it first made the leap to the big screen. Star Trek: The Motion Picture underperformed at the box office and was rightfully criticized for losing track of the crew amid all the spectacle. That happened in part because it was pursuing Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope, which had shattered recorded two years earlier but whose operatic space fantasy began with the big screen in mind. In order to thrive in the multiplexes, Star Trek had to lower its sights. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan cut its budget severely \u2013 down to $11 million, which was less than a third of the first film\u2019s expenses \u2013 but made only slightly less money. More importantly, it kept the focus on the actors, who were cheaper than effects, and Trek fans responded accordingly. That formula has worked for the remainder of the franchise\u2019s big-screen films, but the returns have always been similar. 2009\u2019s Star Trek remains the highest-grossing Trek movie, with $257 million in domestic receipts.  To push past that in an effort to essentially double the gross would be a disastrous move. The Motion Picture discovered that to its detriment, and the franchise learned those lessons well. The impact of COVID on movie theater attendance has only enhanced those conditions, such that expecting Star Trek to perform on a heretofore unseen level misses both the history and the key appeal that made it a success in the first place. In the meantime, it\u2019s thriving on streaming services as never before, with five successful series currently in production and more on the way. That\u2019s the screen it was built for, and while the Kelvinverse can continue to do well in movie theaters, it means seriously rethinking what success in that format means.

The classic Shonen Jump series City Hunter will return with a new movie.  The new animated film was announced with a short teaser trailer that shows series' protagonist, Ryo Saeba, who will once again be voiced by veteran voice actor Akira Kamiya, who portrayed the character in the original 1987 anime series. The trailer is set to the song \"Get Wild\" by Japanese new wave band TM Network. The song was previously used as the first ending theme for the classic anime. A premiere date was not announced for the movie, but the preview does state that the movie is being produced to coincide with the 35th anniversary of the anime's premiere, which will occur in 2023.  RELATED: A Guide to City Hunter, the Cult Crime Franchise    City Hunter tells the story of Ryo Saeba, who survived a plane crash in Central America as a young child and is raised as a guerilla soldier. After honing his skills through a lifetime of warfare, Saeba returns to Japan as an adult, where he decides to use his talents to make a living as a private detective. The series was created by writer and artist Tsukasa Hojo. Hojo's original manga was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1985\u20131991. The manga was one of the biggest hits of the era in Japan, and several publishers attempted to license the series for release in the West, but these plans were stalled after Hojo refused to allow his artwork to be flipped and insisted that it only be published in manga's standard right-to-left format, which would have been unfamiliar with readers outside of Asia at the time. The manga was finally released in English in the early 2000s.  RELATED: Shonen Jump Publisher Enters Gaming Industry with Shueisha Games Hojo's manga is also notable for the amount of times it has been adapted: the series was first brought to the screen with the previously mentioned 1987 anime adaptation, which was produced by legendary animation studio Sunrise (Mobile Suit Gundam, Cowboy Bebop). The anime series ended in 1991, but the series has release multiple movies in the years since, the most recent of which was 2019's City Hunter: The Movie - Shinjuku Private Eyes. A number of live-action adaptations based on the manga have also been produced, including a Korean drama, a Japanese TV series, and most notably, a Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jackie Chan.  The original anime and its follow-up movies are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

The classic Shonen Jump series City Hunter will return with a new movie.  The new animated film was announced with a short teaser trailer that shows series' protagonist, Ryo Saeba, who will once again be voiced by veteran voice actor Akira Kamiya, who portrayed the character in the original 1987 anime series. The trailer is set to the song \"Get Wild\" by Japanese new wave band TM Network. The song was previously used as the first ending theme for the classic anime. A premiere date was not announced for the movie, but the preview does state that the movie is being produced to coincide with the 35th anniversary of the anime's premiere, which will occur in 2023.  RELATED: A Guide to City Hunter, the Cult Crime Franchise    City Hunter tells the story of Ryo Saeba, who survived a plane crash in Central America as a young child and is raised as a guerilla soldier. After honing his skills through a lifetime of warfare, Saeba returns to Japan as an adult, where he decides to use his talents to make a living as a private detective. The series was created by writer and artist Tsukasa Hojo. Hojo's original manga was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1985\u20131991. The manga was one of the biggest hits of the era in Japan, and several publishers attempted to license the series for release in the West, but these plans were stalled after Hojo refused to allow his artwork to be flipped and insisted that it only be published in manga's standard right-to-left format, which would have been unfamiliar with readers outside of Asia at the time. The manga was finally released in English in the early 2000s.  RELATED: Shonen Jump Publisher Enters Gaming Industry with Shueisha Games Hojo's manga is also notable for the amount of times it has been adapted: the series was first brought to the screen with the previously mentioned 1987 anime adaptation, which was produced by legendary animation studio Sunrise (Mobile Suit Gundam, Cowboy Bebop). The anime series ended in 1991, but the series has release multiple movies in the years since, the most recent of which was 2019's City Hunter: The Movie - Shinjuku Private Eyes. A number of live-action adaptations based on the manga have also been produced, including a Korean drama, a Japanese TV series, and most notably, a Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jackie Chan.  The original anime and its follow-up movies are available for streaming on Crunchyroll.

Vault's West of Sundown #1   Artist  Jim Terry    Colorist  Triona Farrell    Cover Artist  Tim Daniel, Aaron Campbell    Letterer  Crank!    Price  3.99    Publisher  Vault Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Tim Seeley, Aaron Campbell      DC Comics veterans Tim Seeley and Aaron Campbell have penned their own original story, an ambitious amalgam of vampire thriller, monster horror, and Old Western, debuting this week from Vault Comics. Besides its illustrious writing team, West of Sundown #1 is created by artist Jim Terry, with colors by Triona Farrell and letters by Crank!.\u00a0The cover touts a vintage monster story, framed by expressionistic art, gorgeous enough that many people will be buying this comic based on the outward aesthetic alone.  West of Sundown #1 follows the unexpected and untimely waking of vampire Constance Der Abend midway through a civil war she had very much intended to sleep through. Stumbling across her resting place, Dooley O'Shaughnessy, a confederate soldier without a cause, jumps at the opportunity to bail out of the war and become a full-time vampire manservant. When an unfortunate twist of fate drives them out of their fashionable New York upper-crust life, the pair must return to Constance's homeland of New Mexico to a much-changed landscape teeming with threats and lurking monsters. RELATED:\u00a0DC's Batman #122 Comic Review                 Seeley and Campbell have delivered an extremely functional prologue to their vampire Western, although largely devoid of the kind of flair or style\u00a0expected from the intersection of two incredibly dramatic genres. The plot itself has admirable clarity, but there is very little wit or elegance to the dialogue, especially with such colorful characters to play with. The dynamic between Dooley and Constance is touching, arguably the most interesting and novel part of the whole comic. Their relationship, somewhere between maternal and benevolent god, feels authentic and has lots of room to grow.

Vault's West of Sundown #1   Artist  Jim Terry    Colorist  Triona Farrell    Cover Artist  Tim Daniel, Aaron Campbell    Letterer  Crank!    Price  3.99    Publisher  Vault Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Tim Seeley, Aaron Campbell      DC Comics veterans Tim Seeley and Aaron Campbell have penned their own original story, an ambitious amalgam of vampire thriller, monster horror, and Old Western, debuting this week from Vault Comics. Besides its illustrious writing team, West of Sundown #1 is created by artist Jim Terry, with colors by Triona Farrell and letters by Crank!.\u00a0The cover touts a vintage monster story, framed by expressionistic art, gorgeous enough that many people will be buying this comic based on the outward aesthetic alone.  West of Sundown #1 follows the unexpected and untimely waking of vampire Constance Der Abend midway through a civil war she had very much intended to sleep through. Stumbling across her resting place, Dooley O'Shaughnessy, a confederate soldier without a cause, jumps at the opportunity to bail out of the war and become a full-time vampire manservant. When an unfortunate twist of fate drives them out of their fashionable New York upper-crust life, the pair must return to Constance's homeland of New Mexico to a much-changed landscape teeming with threats and lurking monsters. RELATED:\u00a0DC's Batman #122 Comic Review                 Seeley and Campbell have delivered an extremely functional prologue to their vampire Western, although largely devoid of the kind of flair or style\u00a0expected from the intersection of two incredibly dramatic genres. The plot itself has admirable clarity, but there is very little wit or elegance to the dialogue, especially with such colorful characters to play with. The dynamic between Dooley and Constance is touching, arguably the most interesting and novel part of the whole comic. Their relationship, somewhere between maternal and benevolent god, feels authentic and has lots of room to grow. Disappointingly, West of Sundown #1 does little to add to or complicate existing vampire lore, dealing mostly in already overplayed stereotypes with a\u00a0 pale, dark-haired rich socialite who feeds off only those who deserve it. The twist of Constance's homeland and its importance is a much-needed detail that makes the story infinitely more memorable. Perhaps West of Sundown is hoarding its best and most inventive ideas for later in the story,\u00a0which would only suggest some problems with the first issue's\u00a0pacing and judgment.  The art, all produced by Terry, presents some of the strongest moments of West of Sundown #1. His depiction of Constance is appropriately inhuman in her perfection. Frequently the humans appear monstrous in contrast to her, a fascinating subversion waiting to be experimented with. The expressionist style of the cover is scarcely visible in the comic itself, generally working in much more conventional lines, which adds to the clarity but detracts from the distinct mood the comic is trying to set. The two-page spreads are the most artistically ambitious moments of the issue, with smaller undefined panels looping around a centerpiece in a way that feels chaotic and miasmic in equal measure, to stunning results.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review Farrell's colors are understated, often softened and neutral even in intense moments. The sepia undertone sells the vintage angle, making the comic feel like it is moving through the lens of the past. However, it means that any expectations built from the gorgeous cover of an ethereal, experimental visual experience are disappointed,\u00a0met instead with a more lifelike and pedestrian approach. The letters, courtesy of Crank!, add a huge amount of much-needed dimension to the dialogue. The sound effects are also very well considered. The choice to change up the lettering for Dooley's internal monologue does a great job of setting a tone for the comic's second half and communicating more about Dooley's personality.  West of Sundown #1 has all the ingredients to be a terrific horror/Western, but the debut issue lacks edge or\u00a0bite. There are moments of visual flair or satisfying character development, but overall, it fails to shock or awe or deliver on the aesthetic hinted at by the cover art. The comic's conclusion promises that conflict is just around the corner, and this team has put together an intriguing enough premise to make the next installments worth investigating.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

Home Anime Kaguya-sama: Fujiwara Is the Best, Worst, Most Annoying & Most Important Character    Kaguya-sama: Fujiwara Is the Best, Worst, Most Annoying & Most Important Character  By Ryan McCarthy Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Student Council Secretary Fujiwara Chika is a jack of all trades when it comes to her bizarre role in Kaguya-sama: Love Is War.                 As far as Fujiwara Chika is concerned, she's the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. The Student Council Secretary is as loveable as she is unlikeable, and her delightfully inane shenanigans are outweighed only by the chaos and destruction she wreaks upon the Student Council Room every time she enters or exists in close proximity to it. She's the kind of character who viewers can't wait to see what she'll do next but also wish she would just go away. The paradox to end all paradoxes, Fujiwara is the best, worst, most annoying and most important character in a series that she goes to extraordinary lengths to make about herself.  In Fujiwara's defense, it's not like her fellow Student Council members are entirely well-adjusted either. Shinomiya Kaguya usually considers Fujiwara either sub-human garbage she'd prefer to set adrift at sea without a life jacket or her best friend, depending on whatever it is that Fujiwara has most recently said or done. Fujiwara often deserves Shinomiya's ire, but she also must be protected at all costs because the audience deserves to know whether or not Fujiwara is intentionally ruining the love war between Shinomiya and Shirogane. Fujiwara is either a diabolical genius or an unbiased force of nature whose lifeblood is the very chaos she ignites wherever she goes.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Fujiwara Is Kaguya-Sama's Best Character                 There's never a dull moment when Fujiwara is around. At any moment, she's liable to break out in a highly choreographed dance, suggest an overly-complicated game that she'll instantly start cheating at or show a seasoned ramen lover what a real connoisseur looks like. She's a good friend to Shirogane whenever he needs help with whatever new thing he's terrible at, and she undoubtedly adores Shinomiya. Fujiwara can't be pigeonholed because she's doing something different every episode, either showing off incredible intelligence and skill or an incredible lack thereof. She's a member of the Tabletop Game Club, the conductor for the morning singing of Shuchi'in Academy's anthem, a proud dog mom, an average volleyball player and an ace(ish) detective who can't whistle or read the room. The only thing that's predictable about her is her unpredictability, and it's her biggest strength as the series' most versatile character.          Fujiwara Is Also Love Is War's Worst Character                 The flip side to Fujiwara's versatility is that she's more of a plot device than a character. Need a funny joke to end an otherwise serious scene? Send in Fujiwara. Need someone for a lead character to confide in to further their own story? Fujiwara's the gal for the job. Ishigami has gotten his own episode devoted to his history and the challenges he's overcome, and even Hayasaka has had some sympathetic moments as Shinomiya's caretaker. Fujiwara, unfortunately, has never had any kind of character arc because her role is simply to cause madness and mayhem. She has never had a personal insecurity to overcome, an enemy to defeat or even a brief moment of self-reflection. Fujiwara is only here for a good time, and she doesn't accept criticism or responsibility, which would make her hard to root for if there was ever anything actually happening with her.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 to Premiere in US Theaters          Fujiwara Is The Series' Most Annoying Character                 Despite Fujiwara's best efforts, she is not the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War -- in fact, she might actually be the villain. The battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane to get the other to confess their love is the driving force of the series, and Fujiwara is constantly derailing it. Shinomiya and Shirogane are possibly two of the most stubborn characters in anime, considering the entire premise of their show is based on how stubborn they are. On the rare occasion that one or both of them drop their guard and there's an opportunity for them to give up the act and be together, here comes Fujiwara to eat the food they're feeding each other or just kill the vibe in general. Once or twice could be chalked up to bad timing, but Fujiwara might just be the biggest reason that Shinomiya and Shirogane aren't a couple yet -- other than their own pride, of course.          Kaguya-sama: Love Is War Couldn't Survive Without Fujiwara                 Given that the whole point of the show is who's going to confess first, a confession can't happen at all until the end of the series, as without Shinomiya and Shirogane's battle, there's no story. This makes Fujiwara the most important character because her constant, exhausting, frustrating, childish, selfish and hilarious interruptions and love-blocking antics keep the series afloat. There should be exactly zero fans of Fujiwara Chika given the undesirable role of roadblock that she's forced to play in the series. That she's so loved despite this is a testament to the strength of her character, even if nothing about her ever makes sense -- because without her, the show wouldn't make sense either.

As far as Fujiwara Chika is concerned, she's the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War. The Student Council Secretary is as loveable as she is unlikeable, and her delightfully inane shenanigans are outweighed only by the chaos and destruction she wreaks upon the Student Council Room every time she enters or exists in close proximity to it. She's the kind of character who viewers can't wait to see what she'll do next but also wish she would just go away. The paradox to end all paradoxes, Fujiwara is the best, worst, most annoying and most important character in a series that she goes to extraordinary lengths to make about herself.  In Fujiwara's defense, it's not like her fellow Student Council members are entirely well-adjusted either. Shinomiya Kaguya usually considers Fujiwara either sub-human garbage she'd prefer to set adrift at sea without a life jacket or her best friend, depending on whatever it is that Fujiwara has most recently said or done. Fujiwara often deserves Shinomiya's ire, but she also must be protected at all costs because the audience deserves to know whether or not Fujiwara is intentionally ruining the love war between Shinomiya and Shirogane. Fujiwara is either a diabolical genius or an unbiased force of nature whose lifeblood is the very chaos she ignites wherever she goes.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: What's the Score Heading Into Season 3?          Fujiwara Is Kaguya-Sama's Best Character                 There's never a dull moment when Fujiwara is around. At any moment, she's liable to break out in a highly choreographed dance, suggest an overly-complicated game that she'll instantly start cheating at or show a seasoned ramen lover what a real connoisseur looks like. She's a good friend to Shirogane whenever he needs help with whatever new thing he's terrible at, and she undoubtedly adores Shinomiya. Fujiwara can't be pigeonholed because she's doing something different every episode, either showing off incredible intelligence and skill or an incredible lack thereof. She's a member of the Tabletop Game Club, the conductor for the morning singing of Shuchi'in Academy's anthem, a proud dog mom, an average volleyball player and an ace(ish) detective who can't whistle or read the room. The only thing that's predictable about her is her unpredictability, and it's her biggest strength as the series' most versatile character.          Fujiwara Is Also Love Is War's Worst Character                 The flip side to Fujiwara's versatility is that she's more of a plot device than a character. Need a funny joke to end an otherwise serious scene? Send in Fujiwara. Need someone for a lead character to confide in to further their own story? Fujiwara's the gal for the job. Ishigami has gotten his own episode devoted to his history and the challenges he's overcome, and even Hayasaka has had some sympathetic moments as Shinomiya's caretaker. Fujiwara, unfortunately, has never had any kind of character arc because her role is simply to cause madness and mayhem. She has never had a personal insecurity to overcome, an enemy to defeat or even a brief moment of self-reflection. Fujiwara is only here for a good time, and she doesn't accept criticism or responsibility, which would make her hard to root for if there was ever anything actually happening with her.  RELATED: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Season 3 to Premiere in US Theaters          Fujiwara Is The Series' Most Annoying Character                 Despite Fujiwara's best efforts, she is not the main character of Kaguya-sama: Love Is War -- in fact, she might actually be the villain. The battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane to get the other to confess their love is the driving force of the series, and Fujiwara is constantly derailing it. Shinomiya and Shirogane are possibly two of the most stubborn characters in anime, considering the entire premise of their show is based on how stubborn they are. On the rare occasion that one or both of them drop their guard and there's an opportunity for them to give up the act and be together, here comes Fujiwara to eat the food they're feeding each other or just kill the vibe in general. Once or twice could be chalked up to bad timing, but Fujiwara might just be the biggest reason that Shinomiya and Shirogane aren't a couple yet -- other than their own pride, of course.          Kaguya-sama: Love Is War Couldn't Survive Without Fujiwara                 Given that the whole point of the show is who's going to confess first, a confession can't happen at all until the end of the series, as without Shinomiya and Shirogane's battle, there's no story. This makes Fujiwara the most important character because her constant, exhausting, frustrating, childish, selfish and hilarious interruptions and love-blocking antics keep the series afloat. There should be exactly zero fans of Fujiwara Chika given the undesirable role of roadblock that she's forced to play in the series. That she's so loved despite this is a testament to the strength of her character, even if nothing about her ever makes sense -- because without her, the show wouldn't make sense either.

Many works throughout the decades have adapted and re-imagined the writings of William Shakespeare, but perhaps none more so than Requiem of the Rose King. Combining two Shakespeare plays into one, the result is an entirely different story altogether. The original manga recently came to an end just as the anime began, with two versions of the very altered history now available.  History and literature buffs who think they know the story already are in for several surprises, while those who don't even like Shakespeare are sure to find something that they enjoy in the franchise. Here's more on what Requiem of the Rose King is about, as well as how to read and watch the different versions of it. RELATED: How to Get Started With K-On!          The Plot of Requiem of the Rose King                 Requiem of the Rose King loosely combines elements of William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3 and Richard III, turning the War of the Roses completely on its head. In the story, the Houses of York and Lancaster battle over England, with the House of York losing its leader to a deadly enemy attack. Left in the wake of this loss is Richard III, the king's intersex son who identifies as male. Richard is hated and feared by many around him, including his own mother, all while spirits torture and subjugate him. Forced into an unlikely situation, Richard prepares to defend his house while dealing with external and internal threats.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Ouran High School Host Club          Where to Read the Requiem of the Rose King Manga                 Requiem of the Rose King began as a manga from Aya Kanno in October 2013, being published in the magazine Monthly Princess. The series ran for almost nine years, ending in early 2022. In the West, the series has been localized by Viz Media, with 14 of the 17 volumes having been released in English-speaking territories. The series has two spin-offs: King of Idol: Bara-\u014c no Gakuen and Bara-\u014c no S\u014dretsu: Gaiden. The former is a more humorous spin-off where the characters are in high school studying to become entertainers, while the latter focuses on events not shown in the main series. Since both of them only began in the last year, neither has yet been localized. The main series' manga can be purchased physically wherever manga is sold, including Walmart, Books-a-Million, Barnes & Noble and Amazon, while Kindle and Comixology carry the digital version.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Bakuman          Where to Watch the Requiem of the Rose King Anime                The anime adaptation of the series began airing in January 2022, just as the manga ended, although it was originally intended to come out in late 2021. Requiem of the Rose King was animated by J.C. Staff, a well-known studio whose recent works include the anime for How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom as well as Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?. The result is a series with beautiful, breathtaking art, befitting the nature of the characters. So far, 13 episodes have aired in Japan, with the show planned to air for two consecutive cours. The only way to watch the series in the West currently is through the Funimation streaming service. However, this service simulcast Requiem of the Rose King, so it's only available as a subtitled series and not dubbed. However, once the series has finished its run, a dub and physical releases will likely be on the way.

HBO Max is working on a new series starring DC's Jackson \"Jake\" Hyde, an openly gay comic book character who is perhaps best known as the second Aqualad -- and who recently became the second Aquaman.  According to Variety, HBO Max is currently developing a live-action adaptation of You Brought Me the Ocean, the GLAAD Media Award-nominated YA graphic novel written by Alex S\u00e1nchez, illustrated by Jul Maroh and lettered by Deron Bennett. The series will consist of hour-long episodes and is being described as a \"dramedy.\" Charlize Theron, A.J. Dix, Beth Kono and Andrew Haas are attached as executive producers. RELATED: DC's New Young Justice Series Continues the Legacy of 'Phantoms' \"The series will explore the life of Jackson 'Jake' Hyde, a gay teenager living in New Mexico,\" Variety explains. \"All his life, he has had a strange attraction to the water and yearns to escape his desert surroundings for the ocean. As he explores his abilities, including breathing under and controlling water, he also finds himself falling in love with his classmate, high school swim captain Kenny Liu.\"  Created by Brandon Vietti, Greg Weisman and Phil Bourassa, the character of Kaldur'ahm (or \"Kaldur\" for short) first appeared in 2010, originating from the popular DC animated series Young Justice. Kaldur was created as a new version Aqualad, taking over for the original Aqualad, Garth, who was going by the name Tempest in the DC comic books at the time. Also in 2010, a slightly modified version of Kaldur named Jackson Hyde made his comic book debut as the new Aqualad in Brightest Day #4. RELATED: Young Justice: Why Every Episode Features the Number '16' In DC's comic book universe, Jackson has been depicted as openly gay post-Rebirth, whereas his Young Justice counterpart has been portrayed as bisexual. In 2020, DC published You Brought Me the Ocean under its DC Graphic Novels for Young Adults imprint, bringing Aqualad's sexuality to the forefront. The graphic novel focuses on yet another modified version of the character named Jake Hyde and his budding romance with Kenny Liu. You Brought Me the Ocean was nominated for Outstanding Comic Book at the 32nd GLAAD Media Awards in 2021.  It was also in 2021 that Jackson Hyde became the second in-continuity Aquaman, taking up the mantle in the six-issue limited series Aquaman: The Becoming. Jackson then teamed up with the original Aquaman, Arthur Curry, for a follow-up series, aptly titled Aquamen.

HBO Max is working on a new series starring DC's Jackson \"Jake\" Hyde, an openly gay comic book character who is perhaps best known as the second Aqualad -- and who recently became the second Aquaman.  According to Variety, HBO Max is currently developing a live-action adaptation of You Brought Me the Ocean, the GLAAD Media Award-nominated YA graphic novel written by Alex S\u00e1nchez, illustrated by Jul Maroh and lettered by Deron Bennett. The series will consist of hour-long episodes and is being described as a \"dramedy.\" Charlize Theron, A.J. Dix, Beth Kono and Andrew Haas are attached as executive producers. RELATED: DC's New Young Justice Series Continues the Legacy of 'Phantoms' \"The series will explore the life of Jackson 'Jake' Hyde, a gay teenager living in New Mexico,\" Variety explains. \"All his life, he has had a strange attraction to the water and yearns to escape his desert surroundings for the ocean. As he explores his abilities, including breathing under and controlling water, he also finds himself falling in love with his classmate, high school swim captain Kenny Liu.\"  Created by Brandon Vietti, Greg Weisman and Phil Bourassa, the character of Kaldur'ahm (or \"Kaldur\" for short) first appeared in 2010, originating from the popular DC animated series Young Justice. Kaldur was created as a new version Aqualad, taking over for the original Aqualad, Garth, who was going by the name Tempest in the DC comic books at the time.

John Stewart comes face-to-face with a comic book legend in DC's Green Lantern #12 -- even if he doesn't realize it.  DC has provided CBR with an official preview for Green Lantern #12, which is set to hit comic shops on Tuesday, April 12 -- having been pushed back from its original solicited release date of March 1. The issue comes from writer Geoffrey Thorne, artists Tom Raney and Marco Santucci, colorist Mike Atiyeh and letterer Rob Leigh. It features a main cover by Bernard Chang and Alex Sinclair, as well as a variant cover by Alan Quah. RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: DC's Round Robin Round 2 Creative Teams and Expanded Descriptions, Revealed The preview itself sees John Stewart/Green Lantern meet The Source, the limitless energy from which all life in the universe emerged. The concept of The Source was created by legendary writer/artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in New Gods #1, cover-dated March 1971. Fittingly, for its Green Lantern appearance, The Source manifests itself as a suit-wearing man who bears an uncanny resemblance to the late, great Kirby.  Of course, The Source has manifested in other forms in the past. \"Sometimes I'm a wall and a flaming hand,\" the entity says, referencing its 1971 debut. \"Once, I was a turtle.\" However, the inspiration for this particular manifestation is undeniable. The scene in question even features a fair amount of Kirby Krackle, an artistic device innovated by The King himself.

John Stewart comes face-to-face with a comic book legend in DC's Green Lantern #12 -- even if he doesn't realize it.  DC has provided CBR with an official preview for Green Lantern #12, which is set to hit comic shops on Tuesday, April 12 -- having been pushed back from its original solicited release date of March 1. The issue comes from writer Geoffrey Thorne, artists Tom Raney and Marco Santucci, colorist Mike Atiyeh and letterer Rob Leigh. It features a main cover by Bernard Chang and Alex Sinclair, as well as a variant cover by Alan Quah. RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: DC's Round Robin Round 2 Creative Teams and Expanded Descriptions, Revealed The preview itself sees John Stewart/Green Lantern meet The Source, the limitless energy from which all life in the universe emerged. The concept of The Source was created by legendary writer/artist Jack Kirby, first appearing in New Gods #1, cover-dated March 1971. Fittingly, for its Green Lantern appearance, The Source manifests itself as a suit-wearing man who bears an uncanny resemblance to the late, great Kirby.  Of course, The Source has manifested in other forms in the past. \"Sometimes I'm a wall and a flaming hand,\" the entity says, referencing its 1971 debut. \"Once, I was a turtle.\" However, the inspiration for this particular manifestation is undeniable. The scene in question even features a fair amount of Kirby Krackle, an artistic device innovated by The King himself.

The day might be saved, but there's still plenty of work to be done. Everything you know about Green Lanterns is about to change!                                                                                           This certainly isn't the first time the current Green Lantern title has referenced Kirby's New Gods, with December's issue #9 having brought the character of Esak back to the DC Universe following an extended absence. Written by Geoffrey Thorne, illustrated by Tom Raney and Marco Santucci, colored by Mike Atiyeh and lettered by Rob Leigh, Green Lantern #12 goes on sale April 12 from DC.

The following contains spoilers for Season 2 of Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon, now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation, Animelab and Hulu.   With the recent conclusion of Yashahime Season 2, fans have been left with several questions surrounding the Great Dog Demon Family and the original cast of Inuyasha. After the Season 2 finale wrapped up the series' main plot arc with the death of Kirinmaru, the heroes seem happy and free of conflict at last.  While this peaceful and reflective season finale left many wondering if Season 2 will be the end of the entire series, there are still several unanswered questions for Yashahime to hopefully address in future seasons. RELATED: Yashahime Concludes Its Biggest Arc Yet With Death - and Happiness          Does Sesshomaru Love His Daughters?                At the end of Season 2, Towa and Setsuna reunite with their mother Rin to celebrate their recent victory. When Rin gifts her twin daughters fancy fabrics given to them by their father, the twins question his actions and parenting style. They ask Rin why Sessh\u014dmaru didn't help them more when they were growing up -- and when they faced Zero and Kirinmaru.  After calling their father's love for them into question, Rin assures her daughters that he loves them and is relieved that they grew up to become strong on their own. Despite Sessh\u014dmaru displaying tremendous character growth as he operated in the shadows to protect his family, the twins hope to uncover their kuudere father's true feelings. RELATED: The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home          How Is Riku Still Alive?                 As the former horn of Kirinmaru, Riku has proven to have several lives in Yashahime. After suffering many fatal and near-fatal injuries, this mysterious character has always managed to return from the grave to shock fans. Toward the very end of Season 2, Riku is killed by Mr. Kirin within the Grim Butterfly. He says a tearful goodbye to Towa and confesses his love for her before seemingly dying for good.  However, when Towa's body is returned to her by Rion, many fans spotted a mysterious horn-shaped figure inside her body. In the Season 2 finale, Riku is resurrected and reappears to explain that he is no longer part of Kirinmaru -- and that he was revived by Rion and Kirinmaru's Kon and Haku. Setsuna questions how this is possible, as do many fans. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons          Why Didn't Sango and Miroku Raise Moroha?                 Since Yashahime began, many fans questioned the noticeable absence of the original Inuyasha cast. Despite Sango and Miroku being alive and well with their own family, they are surprisingly absent from Moroha's life. Kagome and Inuyasha instructed Hachi to take the baby Moroha to the Wolf Demon Tribe for protection instead of entrusting their two best friends with their daughter in their absence.  While they may have chosen Koga and the Wolf Demon Tribe for protection and the strength in numbers, Sango and Miroku have proven their own strength and capabilities time and time again. Not only were Sango and Miroku oddly absent from Moroha's life, but Shippo somehow failed to find Moroha despite her living nearby. RELATED: What Religion Do Anime Monks Like Inyuasha's Miroku Practice?          How Strong Is Shippo Now?                 During the time skip between Inuyasha and Yashahime, it's revealed that Shippo has become a respectable and powerful teacher at a fox-demon school. After spending most of Inuyasha training to become a full-fledged fox demon, he now has the 25th and highest rank in the demon promotions and spends most of his time preparing others for their own exams.  In his first appearance in the sequel, Shippo surprised fans by taking on the form of an elderly fox and a young man before returning to his more familiar younger form. After achieving the highest rank and learning advanced Fox Magic like \"Up, Up, and Away\", many fans are wondering just how powerful Shippo has become and what tricks he might reveal later in the series. RELATED: Should Moroha Have Been Yashahime's Main Character?          Which Twin is Stronger: Towa or Setsuna?                 Towa and Setsuna sparred several times throughout Yashahime when they were pitted against each other by their enemies or emotional outbursts. Given their unique strengths and weaknesses that cancel each other out, these battles typically ended it stalemates. Since the sisters wield different weapons and inherited different powers from their immensely powerful father, it's incredibly difficult to compare the two. While they are both inarguably strong as the daughters of the Great Beast King of the West, the series has never revealed who would ultimately win in an all-out fight between the two.                   After Its Satisfying Season 2 Finale, Does Yashahime Need a Season 3?

A talented fan has transformed the grubby Trash Bag Pok\u00e9mon, Trubbish, into a creature of pure elegance and beauty.  Popular cosplayer and vtuber Mink the Satyr posted multiple pictures of her Trubbish-inspired costume to Twitter. The beautiful evening gown features delicate lace, billowing sleeves and a full skirt. The cosplayer also uploaded a much more comical version of the costume as an April Fool's joke. RELATED: Electrifying Pok\u00e9mon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech    According to the various Pok\u00e9dex entries for the monster, Trubbish is a fifth-generation Pok\u00e9mon and a fusion of garbage bags, industrial waste and chemical agents. It belches toxic gas and has a tendency to follow individuals who litter around. Beyond the games, Trubbish has appeared several times in the greater Pok\u00e9mon franchise, making minor appearances, for example, in the episodes \"Crystal-Clear Sleuthing!\" and \"Love at First Twirl!\" in Pok\u00e9mon the Series: Sun & Moon.  There have been more recent developments in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise than just beautiful cosplays. Most notably, two new games -- Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet -- are scheduled to debut sometime late this year. These games will introduce fans to the ninth generation of Pok\u00e9mon and many have already fallen in love with the new starters -- Fucecoco, Sprigatito and Quaxly. Scarlet and Violet will include the open-world gameplay style featured in Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus and showcase a Spain-inspired setting.

These include Ash reuniting with his Greninja, Chloe competing in a contest with her Eevee and Goh encountering the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Suicune (and possibly Mew as well). Pok\u00e9mon Master Journeys is the twenty-fourth mainline anime series for the franchise; it premiered on Dec. 11, 2020, in Japan and in the United States on Sept. 10, 2021. An anime based on Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus has also been announced. While little information about the series has been released, it is expected to premiere online sometime in 2022. Arceus is also getting a special tie-in expansion for the Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game. Astral Radiance will introduce a wealth of cards to the ever-expanding tabletop game and will usher in Radiant Pok\u00e9mon, a brand-new mechanic. The expansion is scheduled to launch on May 27 and pre-orders are now available.  Several entries in the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, including Pok\u00e9mon Master Journeys, can be found and streamed on Netflix.

One creative superhero fan has merged the magical worlds of Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon and the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Moon Knight, creating \"the crossover no one asked for.\"  The image, which was posted on Twitter by professional production designer Mingjue Helen Chen, depicts Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon donning a costume reminiscent of Marc Spector/Moon Knight's super suit. The long, white cape and Usagi's iconic blond hair flutter in the foreground, while a glowing crescent moon features in the background. According to Chen, this fusion is \"the only thing I think of when I watch Moon Knight.\" RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime      Based on the character created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, Moon Knight premiered on March 30 and is the sixth television series in the MCU. The show stars Oscar Isaac as the titular hero, who is a mercenary who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Other members of the case include May Calamawy, Ethan Hawke and Karim El-Hakim. The show's creative team includes writer Jeremy Slater (The Umbrella Academy), cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (The Green Knight) and director Mohamed Diab.  Moon Knight's story is heavily rooted in the culture of ancient Egypt, and those involved have made an active effort to stay as historically and mythologically accurate as possible. This careful attention to detail is notable in the wake of Diab's criticism of DC comic book movies, including Wonder Woman 1984, for their inaccurate depictions of the country and its culture. RELATED: Marvel Fans Are Convinced Moon Knight Dropped the MCU's First F-Bomb The original Sailor Moon manga series was published in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine from 1991 to 1997, producing 18 volumes worth of content. The story follows high schooler Usagi and her friends as they fight villains and prevent the destruction of the universe as the Sailor Guardians. The manga has a devoted fan following; over 35 million copies of the series have been sold globally.  The Sailor Moon manga was first adapted into an anime by Toei Animation in 1992 and has gone on to inspire a wealth of tie-in books, films, video and tabletop games, stage musicals and even an ice skating show. It has also spawned several theme park attractions; the popular Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon The Miracle 4D: Moon Palace Chapter attraction from 2019 is set to return as part of this year's Universal Cool Japan and will feature an extra scene. The first season of Moon Knight is currently making its debut on Disney+, and various entries in the Sailor Moon franchise are available to stream on Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix.

One creative superhero fan has merged the magical worlds of Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon and the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Moon Knight, creating \"the crossover no one asked for.\"  The image, which was posted on Twitter by professional production designer Mingjue Helen Chen, depicts Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon donning a costume reminiscent of Marc Spector/Moon Knight's super suit. The long, white cape and Usagi's iconic blond hair flutter in the foreground, while a glowing crescent moon features in the background. According to Chen, this fusion is \"the only thing I think of when I watch Moon Knight.\" RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime      Based on the character created by writer Doug Moench and artist Don Perlin, Moon Knight premiered on March 30 and is the sixth television series in the MCU. The show stars Oscar Isaac as the titular hero, who is a mercenary who suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Other members of the case include May Calamawy, Ethan Hawke and Karim El-Hakim. The show's creative team includes writer Jeremy Slater (The Umbrella Academy), cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo (The Green Knight) and director Mohamed Diab.  Moon Knight's story is heavily rooted in the culture of ancient Egypt, and those involved have made an active effort to stay as historically and mythologically accurate as possible. This careful attention to detail is notable in the wake of Diab's criticism of DC comic book movies, including Wonder Woman 1984, for their inaccurate depictions of the country and its culture. RELATED: Marvel Fans Are Convinced Moon Knight Dropped the MCU's First F-Bomb The original Sailor Moon manga series was published in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine from 1991 to 1997, producing 18 volumes worth of content. The story follows high schooler Usagi and her friends as they fight villains and prevent the destruction of the universe as the Sailor Guardians. The manga has a devoted fan following; over 35 million copies of the series have been sold globally.  The Sailor Moon manga was first adapted into an anime by Toei Animation in 1992 and has gone on to inspire a wealth of tie-in books, films, video and tabletop games, stage musicals and even an ice skating show. It has also spawned several theme park attractions; the popular Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon The Miracle 4D: Moon Palace Chapter attraction from 2019 is set to return as part of this year's Universal Cool Japan and will feature an extra scene. The first season of Moon Knight is currently making its debut on Disney+, and various entries in the Sailor Moon franchise are available to stream on Funimation, Crunchyroll, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Netflix.

Goku and Vegeta have been friendly rivals since Dragon Ball Z, but Goku has always been the more relied upon fighter between the two. Goku may currently be the strongest fighter, but Vegeta has been making many strides to keep up with his rival counterpart as the series progresses.  RELATED: 10 Best Things About Goku Under Whis' tutelage paired with their constant encounters with stronger foes, Goku and Vegeta have had their work cut out for them. Whis has mentioned the flaws that each fighter possesses and points out that the two are strongest when fused together. If Goku could pick up on some of the qualities that Vegeta has, Goku could become just as powerful as any God of destruction.  10          Having A Sense Of Pride As A Saiyan                 Part of Goku's charm is that he doesn't carry the same level of pride as his warrior race, the Saiyans. By comparison, Vegeta's greatest asset as the \"Prince of all Saiyans\" is his incomparable pride of being one.  Goku learning more about the Saiyans' pride may make him a bit more boastful, but finding confidence in being a natural-born warrior may go a long way in his mentality when fighting. This sense of pride may help Goku take fights a bit more seriously.  9          Being A (Better) Role Model For Your Kids                 Fans of Dragon Ball would agree that Goku hasn't necessarily been around for a good portion of Gohan's youth. Whenever Goku showed up, trouble would soon follow. Vegeta on the other hand has grown to become a great parent and is looked up to by both present and future Trunks. RELATED:Dragon Ball Z: 10 Times Goku Put Himself Before His Family  Goku isn't winning any \"Father Of The Year\" awards compared to Vegeta's level of parenting. Vegeta is shown spending quality time taking care of the kids, and not all time spent with his son Trunks' training.  8          Having Original Attacks                 The Kamehameha and Solar Flare are some of Goku's signature attacks. Sadly, those abilities aren't his original moves. A lot of Goku's moves and abilities were taught to him by teachers he either sought out or ran into. For Goku to be the main protagonist, it's surprising that he doesn't have a move that he has created on his own.  Vegeta has a bunch of special moves, that surprisingly, Goku hasn't taken and made his own. From his famous Galick Gun to Big Bang Attack, Vegeta has mastered many moves that weren't taught to him by Gods or aliens.  7          How To Treat Your Wife                 Why Chi-Chi is still with Goku remains a mystery, but being married to the strongest warrior in the universe must have some perks. However, Vegeta has gone the extra mile and has shown multiple subtle displays of affection to his wife, Bulma, that Goku could take notes on. Vegeta and Bulma may not have started off on the right foot, but Vegeta has shown admiration for his wife's abilities and agitation towards anyone that would bother \"his Bulma.\" Vegeta hasn't spent many years away from his family to train in the afterlife and has taken on babysitting the kids whenever his wife asked.  6          Vegeta's Fashion Sense If these two had to do a popularity contest based on style, Vegeta would win every time. Goku has been wearing the same orange gi since Dragon Ball. Dragon Ball GT finally gave him a new gi color, but the style was lacking compared to Vegeta's. The few times Goku has changed, the clothes wouldn't fit him very well, and he has mentioned that he doesn't feel comfortable in clothes that fit him. Maybe give credit to Bulma for Vegeta's trendy clothes, but Vegeta's style doesn't mind taking risks. Remember when Vegeta had a mustache?  5          Showing Respect To Higher Beings                 Goku has been on the verge of ending many lives by just being the whimsical martial artist he is. For someone that can read power levels and sense ki energy, Goku usually lacks formality towards gods and other higher beings that can easily wipe away existences. Vegeta, who is aware of the statuses and legends of these beings, always rolls out the red carpet. RELATED: 10 Times Goku Was Put In His Place In Dragon Ball Although his pride usually overshadows his judgment, Vegeta knows when to be quiet and respectful toward those higher in power. Especially when that power can wipe away or restore a universe. Vegeta provides many meals for Beerus and Whis just to keep the earth safe.  4          Taking Fights More Seriously                 Fans all know the feeling when the Z warriors are about to defeat the enemy, but Goku lets them power up again to turn the tide. Goku never takes his fights seriously until someone dies. He even played around with the likes of Kid Buu's destructive tendencies just to see the extent of his power. Vegeta was a victim of this mentality in the Cell Saga and dearly paid for it. Fast-forward to Vegeta's training with Whis, he has learned to fight at full power regardless of what level his opponent is. Goku has even been told by Whis that he would be stronger if he fought more seriously.  3          Know That All Evil Can't Be Redeemed                 Throughout the series, Goku has met a lot of opponents that later became friends or rivals. Most of his current friends were once conflicts that Goku has to deal with. However, there are some characters that are too evil to be kept alive and have no hope of turning over a new leaf. Vegeta is the opposite and will end an opponent's life without hesitation. Maybe if Goku had Vegeta's standards on what is evil, the majority of Dragon Ball's villains wouldn't be later threats or still trying to destroy the earth.  2          Utilizing Battle Tactics                 Whenever Goku gets into a fight, it's rare to see him thinking with his head. He fights instinctively and doesn't have much of a plan when facing tough opponents. Thanks to his friends and allies, Goku has managed to prevail over foes, but maybe fighting an opponent one-on-one isn't the best idea.  RELATED: 10 Things Goku Learned From Whis Goku could learn to fire a ki blast whenever an enemy has their back turned to him. Vegeta was the difference for shooting Cell in the back when Gohan was struggling against him. It's not fighting dirty, just strategy by catching your opponent by surprise.  1          Goku Can Learn To Be More Careful In Battles                 In Dragon Ball Super, Whis has pointed out Goku's weakness: he's too careless. Though some may describe Goku as more of a clear-headed individual, Vegeta is more of a careful and tactical fighter. Goku could benefit from Vegeta's way of thinking.  Goku letting opponents reach full power or thinking they will turn over a new leaf has gotten him and his friends into a lot of trouble. Vegeta didn't give a second thought to destroying Cooler, Frieza's brother. Maybe Goku should reconsider Frieza's threat level since his potential is so high.

Goku and Vegeta have been friendly rivals since Dragon Ball Z, but Goku has always been the more relied upon fighter between the two. Goku may currently be the strongest fighter, but Vegeta has been making many strides to keep up with his rival counterpart as the series progresses.  RELATED: 10 Best Things About Goku Under Whis' tutelage paired with their constant encounters with stronger foes, Goku and Vegeta have had their work cut out for them. Whis has mentioned the flaws that each fighter possesses and points out that the two are strongest when fused together. If Goku could pick up on some of the qualities that Vegeta has, Goku could become just as powerful as any God of destruction.  10          Having A Sense Of Pride As A Saiyan                 Part of Goku's charm is that he doesn't carry the same level of pride as his warrior race, the Saiyans. By comparison, Vegeta's greatest asset as the \"Prince of all Saiyans\" is his incomparable pride of being one.  Goku learning more about the Saiyans' pride may make him a bit more boastful, but finding confidence in being a natural-born warrior may go a long way in his mentality when fighting. This sense of pride may help Goku take fights a bit more seriously.  9          Being A (Better) Role Model For Your Kids                 Fans of Dragon Ball would agree that Goku hasn't necessarily been around for a good portion of Gohan's youth. Whenever Goku showed up, trouble would soon follow. Vegeta on the other hand has grown to become a great parent and is looked up to by both present and future Trunks. RELATED:Dragon Ball Z: 10 Times Goku Put Himself Before His Family  Goku isn't winning any \"Father Of The Year\" awards compared to Vegeta's level of parenting. Vegeta is shown spending quality time taking care of the kids, and not all time spent with his son Trunks' training.  8          Having Original Attacks                 The Kamehameha and Solar Flare are some of Goku's signature attacks. Sadly, those abilities aren't his original moves. A lot of Goku's moves and abilities were taught to him by teachers he either sought out or ran into. For Goku to be the main protagonist, it's surprising that he doesn't have a move that he has created on his own.  Vegeta has a bunch of special moves, that surprisingly, Goku hasn't taken and made his own. From his famous Galick Gun to Big Bang Attack, Vegeta has mastered many moves that weren't taught to him by Gods or aliens.  7          How To Treat Your Wife                 Why Chi-Chi is still with Goku remains a mystery, but being married to the strongest warrior in the universe must have some perks. However, Vegeta has gone the extra mile and has shown multiple subtle displays of affection to his wife, Bulma, that Goku could take notes on. Vegeta and Bulma may not have started off on the right foot, but Vegeta has shown admiration for his wife's abilities and agitation towards anyone that would bother \"his Bulma.\" Vegeta hasn't spent many years away from his family to train in the afterlife and has taken on babysitting the kids whenever his wife asked.  6          Vegeta's Fashion Sense If these two had to do a popularity contest based on style, Vegeta would win every time. Goku has been wearing the same orange gi since Dragon Ball. Dragon Ball GT finally gave him a new gi color, but the style was lacking compared to Vegeta's. The few times Goku has changed, the clothes wouldn't fit him very well, and he has mentioned that he doesn't feel comfortable in clothes that fit him. Maybe give credit to Bulma for Vegeta's trendy clothes, but Vegeta's style doesn't mind taking risks. Remember when Vegeta had a mustache?  5          Showing Respect To Higher Beings                 Goku has been on the verge of ending many lives by just being the whimsical martial artist he is. For someone that can read power levels and sense ki energy, Goku usually lacks formality towards gods and other higher beings that can easily wipe away existences. Vegeta, who is aware of the statuses and legends of these beings, always rolls out the red carpet. RELATED: 10 Times Goku Was Put In His Place In Dragon Ball Although his pride usually overshadows his judgment, Vegeta knows when to be quiet and respectful toward those higher in power. Especially when that power can wipe away or restore a universe. Vegeta provides many meals for Beerus and Whis just to keep the earth safe.  4          Taking Fights More Seriously                 Fans all know the feeling when the Z warriors are about to defeat the enemy, but Goku lets them power up again to turn the tide. Goku never takes his fights seriously until someone dies. He even played around with the likes of Kid Buu's destructive tendencies just to see the extent of his power. Vegeta was a victim of this mentality in the Cell Saga and dearly paid for it. Fast-forward to Vegeta's training with Whis, he has learned to fight at full power regardless of what level his opponent is. Goku has even been told by Whis that he would be stronger if he fought more seriously.  3          Know That All Evil Can't Be Redeemed                 Throughout the series, Goku has met a lot of opponents that later became friends or rivals. Most of his current friends were once conflicts that Goku has to deal with. However, there are some characters that are too evil to be kept alive and have no hope of turning over a new leaf. Vegeta is the opposite and will end an opponent's life without hesitation. Maybe if Goku had Vegeta's standards on what is evil, the majority of Dragon Ball's villains wouldn't be later threats or still trying to destroy the earth.  2          Utilizing Battle Tactics                 Whenever Goku gets into a fight, it's rare to see him thinking with his head. He fights instinctively and doesn't have much of a plan when facing tough opponents. Thanks to his friends and allies, Goku has managed to prevail over foes, but maybe fighting an opponent one-on-one isn't the best idea.  RELATED: 10 Things Goku Learned From Whis Goku could learn to fire a ki blast whenever an enemy has their back turned to him. Vegeta was the difference for shooting Cell in the back when Gohan was struggling against him. It's not fighting dirty, just strategy by catching your opponent by surprise.  1          Goku Can Learn To Be More Careful In Battles                 In Dragon Ball Super, Whis has pointed out Goku's weakness: he's too careless. Though some may describe Goku as more of a clear-headed individual, Vegeta is more of a careful and tactical fighter. Goku could benefit from Vegeta's way of thinking.  Goku letting opponents reach full power or thinking they will turn over a new leaf has gotten him and his friends into a lot of trouble. Vegeta didn't give a second thought to destroying Cooler, Frieza's brother. Maybe Goku should reconsider Frieza's threat level since his potential is so high.

Home TV TV Features Final Space is Missing Season 4    Final Space is Missing Season 4  By Ian Goodwillie Published 8 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Final Space had a loyal cult following who is still wondering what Season 4 could look like and hopes Netflix might come to the rescue.                 Some TV series succeed despite the odds stacked against them. Given the sheer number of shows out there between networks and streaming, breaking through can seem almost impossible. Yet, a show like Final Space still managed to find its audience and put out three seasons of amazing TV. But its cancelation has left fans on one heck of a cliffhanger, something that needs to be rectified with Season 4 at the very least.  This science-fiction animated series was the brainchild of Olan Rogers. It told the story of Gary Goodspeed, a resounding failure who was sentenced to five years alone on a prison ship while working on communications relays. His only company was the ship's artificial intelligence HUE, a seemingly endless legion of disposable robots called Sames, and KVN, Gary's highly ineffective Deep Space Insanity Avoidance Companion. RELATED: Bob's Burgers Has Allowed Teddy to Overstay His Welcome Over the course of three seasons, Gary would make several new friends and allies. They would be drawn into a massive plot on the part of the evil Invictus, who planned to infect reality with Final Space and take it over with an army of Titans. Gary and his allies fought back against insurmountable odds. It often seemed like every step forward was accompanied by two steps back. But they never gave up and kept fighting the good fight, no matter what.                  No one would ever suggest that Final Space lit up the ratings. But between Adult Swim, TBS, and Netflix, it gained a pretty sizable cult following, more than enough to keep it on the air for three seasons. Unfortunately, the series could not escape the merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery. Its cancellation was part of the cost-cutting and house cleaning measures that went along with that time. RELATED: The King of the Hill Revival Must Ditch Buck Strickland The series left Gary, Quinn, and their allies stuck in a brutal cliffhanger. Invictus was breaking through from Final Space into their reality with an army of Titans following. Their most potent weapon, Ash, had switched sides, leaving them at an extreme disadvantage in the upcoming fight. It's safe to assume they would figure a way out of this, but fans might never get to see what that looks like without a Season 4.  In a 2018 Twitter post, Rogers mentioned that he had the story arced through the end of Season 6. This means that the overall narrative was unlikely to end with the completion of Season 4. But given the opportunity to close out the story, he might be able to write an effective fourth season that would give resolution to fans and an effective conclusion to Gary's adventures. It's something a lot of fans are still hoping will happen. At this point, the most likely savior for the series still appears to be Netflix. The streaming service carried the show after it aired on broadcast networks, and the three existing seasons can still be enjoyed there. There has been no movement on a new season that fans are aware o,f but hope remains. This series had an incredible story that remains incomplete. Maybe it will take the form of a movie or comic books but it needs to be wrapped up in some capacity.                   Does Rick & Morty Actually Want Us to Care About Where It\u2019s Going?

The streaming service carried the show after it aired on broadcast networks, and the three existing seasons can still be enjoyed there. There has been no movement on a new season that fans are aware o,f but hope remains. This series had an incredible story that remains incomplete. Maybe it will take the form of a movie or comic books but it needs to be wrapped up in some capacity.                   Does Rick & Morty Actually Want Us to Care About Where It\u2019s Going?

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions. With no hope of relief in sight, how long can Crosby, Whitamore and Singh preserve their force against annihilation?

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions. With no hope of relief in sight, how long can Crosby, Whitamore and Singh preserve their force against annihilation?

His earliest exploits prove why he's the perfect user of his Devil Fruit.                  The following contains spoilers for the One Piece manga, available in English from Viz Media.   One Piece is once again causing uproar after revealing the truth behind Monkey D. Luffy's Devil Fruit. The one he stole from Shanks during his childhood years has always been thought to be the Gum-Gum Fruit, which gives his body its rubber properties. Throughout the series' long tenure, fans have taken it as a fact since Luffy's abilities check out with the Devil Fruit's description.  In recent chapters of the manga, however, One Piece reveals that Luffy's Devil Fruit is in fact not the Gomu Gomu no Mi but Hito Hito no Mi: Model, Nika. It made its debut when Kaido knocked Luffy out after a long battle, awakening his Devil Fruit abilities. Luffy's Gear Five, which is also believed to be his Devil Fruit awakening, allowed him to execute powerful attacks that are reminiscent of his earlier adventuring days. RELATED: One Piece Characters That Deserve Their Own Series                               Hito Hito no Mi: Model, Nika is modeled on the mythical warrior whom slaves venerated as the Sun God. He was said to be the one who will free them from oppression, but the more notable aspect of this Devil Fruit is the power it grants its user. The Five Elders have even described it as the most ridiculous power in the world, only being limited by the wielder's imagination. Luffy has shown this repeatedly during his most recent fight with Kaido. His attacks have become more outrageous after activating his Gear Five, often applying the properties of rubber not only on himself, but also to his environment and on the other characters.  Even though his attacks are mostly similar to what he usually uses, the effects vary greatly. When Kaido swallowed Luffy, the latter ballooned inside the Emperor's stomach. He also used Kaido's nose as leverage by extending his hands through the dragon's eyes. When Kaido hit Luffy's head with his club, it flattened in the form of the club's surface and remained that way for a bit -- and these are only a few examples of how ridiculous Luffy's power can be. RELATED: Everything We Know About One Piece's Ancient Weapons, the Strongest of Them All                               While Luffy's recent offensive creations have put smiles on One Piece readers' faces, they aren't necessarily surprising. Luffy has a long history of inventing unique and outrageous attacks. He used to be more experimental with his power, often creating at least one comical technique per arc.  During his battle against Crocodile, Luffy expanded his head and attempted to eat the Warlord after realizing none of his attacks were dealing any damage. Similarly, he stole some of Arlong's teeth and used them to bite the Fish-man. These attacks, however, have dwindled after the time skip as One Piece has taken a more serious tone. Nika's revelation brings the series back to its comical root as all of Luffy's absurdity cascades out while in his Gear Five form. Perhaps one attack that will be remembered for years to come is when he used Kaido's dragon form as a jump rope. With bigger wars brewing in One Piece, fans will likely be seeing more of Luffy's greatly-missed inventive genius.

The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28 \"The Dawn of Humanity\", now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation and Hulu.   The Attack on Titan Season 4, Part 2 finale ends on a haunting cliffhanger by bringing forth the Rumbling's promised devastation as Eren Jaeger -- in the form of the Founding Titan -- and the wall titans finally reach the continent of Marley, signaling the beginning of a mass genocide.  Since Eren started the Rumbling several episodes back, both Eldians and Marleyans have scrambled for a way to cease the inevitable. However, Hange Zoe had made it clear they wouldn't be able to stop Eren completely. In other words, while the heroes are fighting to the best of their abilities to save the world, at the very least, a portion of the Rumbling will be carried out successfully -- and audiences can see it's only breeding fear and death. The sight of Eren's absurdly large Founding Titan leading the charge is horrific but familiar, paralleling the Colossal Titan's initial attack against Shiganshina back in Episode 1.  Related: Attack on Titan: Eren Lied to Mikasa                                The fall of Shiganshina was not only the inciting incident to kickstart Attack on Titan, but it also lit an unrelenting flame inside Eren that took his character journey to new territories. Back then, Bertholdt Hoover used the powers of the Colossal Titan to break through the gates of Shiganshina, allowing for any lurking titans to invade. Countless people lost their lives, including Eren's mother Carla, who was eaten alive before his very eyes. Grief-stricken and completely outraged, Eren declared that he will \"kill them all\". In this context, \"them\" referred to the Titans and he continues to carry a deep-seeded hatred for them -- but as the series progresses and mysteries are unraveled, Eren's goal to wipe out \"every single one\" now refers to humans rather than Titans.  In the present, Eren has become what he hates most and the irony is nothing short of tragic. Now, his earlier declaration holds new meaning. As it turns out, Titans are merely Eldians -- humans transformed into a monstrous species against their will. The main conflict in Attack on Titan isn't simply mankind vs. titans, but mankind vs. mankind. Eren wants peace for his people, but 2000 years of fighting and xenophobia makes this complicated. As children, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert used to dream of a world beyond the walls, with the idea of freedom propelling them forward despite the hardships that awaited them as military personnel. The reality is that past the walls awaited more enemies. This realization was detrimental to them all, but it was Eren who took things a bit too far. Fueled by the memory of his mother's death, Eren initiates the Rumbling to eliminate all of humanity except those on Paradis Island.  Related: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                 While the Rumbling is certainly a parallel to the series' start, it's also far more devastating. Instead of one Colossal Titan letting in a tirade of pure Titans to destroy a portion of Paradis Island, Eren leads the charge among an army of Colossal Titans with the intent of destroying the world. While the Marleyans fire off heavy artillery, it quickly proves to be insufficient. Surprisingly, the Wall Titans can swim -- and they swim much faster than they walk. While people aren't being devoured like they were in Episode 1, it's still a slaughter. Soldiers are blown away by pressurized air or melted by the steam exerted by the Titans. The Part 2 finale ends with a shot of a Colossal Titan stepping on the camera, likely implying the fate of the soldiers currently running for their lives. Additionally, like Carla and the victims of Shiganshina, they are dying for reasons they don't fully understand. If that's not enough, the music playing during Eren's attack is a rendition of that which played in Episode 1.  Eren's current belief system in Attack on Titan is twisted, but it's hard to ignore the fact that his beliefs were created by being a victim of circumstance. After first discovering his ability to wield the Attack Titan back in Season 1, Eren wanted to be humanity's hope. But things have changed. The world isn't what he thought it was and by becoming the very thing he once swore to destroy, Eren becomes the world's enemy in the hopes of protecting the people he loves.

The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28 \"The Dawn of Humanity\", now streaming on Crunchyroll, Funimation and Hulu.   The Attack on Titan Season 4, Part 2 finale ends on a haunting cliffhanger by bringing forth the Rumbling's promised devastation as Eren Jaeger -- in the form of the Founding Titan -- and the wall titans finally reach the continent of Marley, signaling the beginning of a mass genocide.  Since Eren started the Rumbling several episodes back, both Eldians and Marleyans have scrambled for a way to cease the inevitable. However, Hange Zoe had made it clear they wouldn't be able to stop Eren completely. In other words, while the heroes are fighting to the best of their abilities to save the world, at the very least, a portion of the Rumbling will be carried out successfully -- and audiences can see it's only breeding fear and death. The sight of Eren's absurdly large Founding Titan leading the charge is horrific but familiar, paralleling the Colossal Titan's initial attack against Shiganshina back in Episode 1.  Related: Attack on Titan: Eren Lied to Mikasa                                The fall of Shiganshina was not only the inciting incident to kickstart Attack on Titan, but it also lit an unrelenting flame inside Eren that took his character journey to new territories. Back then, Bertholdt Hoover used the powers of the Colossal Titan to break through the gates of Shiganshina, allowing for any lurking titans to invade. Countless people lost their lives, including Eren's mother Carla, who was eaten alive before his very eyes. Grief-stricken and completely outraged, Eren declared that he will \"kill them all\". In this context, \"them\" referred to the Titans and he continues to carry a deep-seeded hatred for them -- but as the series progresses and mysteries are unraveled, Eren's goal to wipe out \"every single one\" now refers to humans rather than Titans.  In the present, Eren has become what he hates most and the irony is nothing short of tragic. Now, his earlier declaration holds new meaning. As it turns out, Titans are merely Eldians -- humans transformed into a monstrous species against their will. The main conflict in Attack on Titan isn't simply mankind vs. titans, but mankind vs. mankind. Eren wants peace for his people, but 2000 years of fighting and xenophobia makes this complicated. As children, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert used to dream of a world beyond the walls, with the idea of freedom propelling them forward despite the hardships that awaited them as military personnel. The reality is that past the walls awaited more enemies. This realization was detrimental to them all, but it was Eren who took things a bit too far. Fueled by the memory of his mother's death, Eren initiates the Rumbling to eliminate all of humanity except those on Paradis Island.  Related: Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                 While the Rumbling is certainly a parallel to the series' start, it's also far more devastating. Instead of one Colossal Titan letting in a tirade of pure Titans to destroy a portion of Paradis Island, Eren leads the charge among an army of Colossal Titans with the intent of destroying the world. While the Marleyans fire off heavy artillery, it quickly proves to be insufficient. Surprisingly, the Wall Titans can swim -- and they swim much faster than they walk. While people aren't being devoured like they were in Episode 1, it's still a slaughter. Soldiers are blown away by pressurized air or melted by the steam exerted by the Titans. The Part 2 finale ends with a shot of a Colossal Titan stepping on the camera, likely implying the fate of the soldiers currently running for their lives. Additionally, like Carla and the victims of Shiganshina, they are dying for reasons they don't fully understand. If that's not enough, the music playing during Eren's attack is a rendition of that which played in Episode 1.  Eren's current belief system in Attack on Titan is twisted, but it's hard to ignore the fact that his beliefs were created by being a victim of circumstance. After first discovering his ability to wield the Attack Titan back in Season 1, Eren wanted to be humanity's hope. But things have changed. The world isn't what he thought it was and by becoming the very thing he once swore to destroy, Eren becomes the world's enemy in the hopes of protecting the people he loves.

In a new exclusive clip from the English dub of Attack on Titan: The Final Season - Part 2, Mikasa and Annie question each other's loyalty to Paradis and to Eren.  SPOILERS FOR ATTACK ON TITAN: THE FINAL SEASON - PART 2 FOLLOW: The new clip comes from Episode 84 of the popular dark-fantasy series, which will be available on Crunchyroll on April 10. In the new preview, Annie questions Mikasa, Armin and Connie's ability to fight their former friend and ally, Eren Jaeger. The questioning gets especially heated when Annie pushes Mikasa on her feelings for the series' hero-turned-villain, which causes Mikasa to draw her swords as Annie prepares to transform into her titan form. RELATED: Attack on Titan Reveals the Moment That Solidified Eren's Genocidal Plans    After weeks of speculation from fans, the producers of Attack on Titan confirmed that the show will continue with The Final Season's third act in 2023. The announcement that Part 3 was in production was made after the 12th and final episode of Part 2 was broadcast on April 3. Part 3 will once again be produced by studio MAPPA, who took over production of the series after Wit Studio (Ranking of Kings, Spy x Family) animated the series' first three seasons. While the subtitled simulcast of the season has concluded, Crunchyroll's simuldub of Part 2 is still on-going. Fans who prefer the dubbed version of the series can also watch it on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block. The show was added to the network's late-night schedule earlier this year, alongside other critically acclaimed anime such as Made in Abyss and Assassination Classroom.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Brings Back a Fan Favorite Attack on Titan was created by Hajime Isayama and first published in 2009. The original manga was a massive commercial success, achieving a worldwide circulation of over 100 million copies. The series has also been a similar hit with critics, who have lauded the series for its tense storytelling and memorable cast of characters. The final chapter of the manga was released in 2021, and despite an extremely divisive reaction to the finale, the anime adaptation of the series continues to be one of the most popular shows in the world, with one market analyst firm naming The Final Season \"the most in-demand\" show of 2021.  In addition to the current season, all previous seasons of the anime are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Isayama's complete manga series is available in English from Kodansha USA.

Regardless of what decade or timeline he might be fighting in, there's nobody who can take down an enemy quite like Wolverine can.  In a preview for X-Men '92: House of XCII #1 provided by Marvel, the X-Men from the 1990s era have officially returned and are taking on any army of Sentinels in space. Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey all board an orbiting satellite to stop the Sentinel threat while Beast mans the Blackbird from above. Facing an army of the mutant-hunting robots created by Bolviar Trask, Wolverine manages to destory one of them in what appears to be a single blow. \"I thought I smelled scum,\" the character says as he's doing it. \"If Trask is on this station, I'm not wasting my time with these tin cans.\"  RELATED: Dark Ages Confirms Which X-Man Could Actually Kill Wolverine                                                                            The Sentinels first appeared in 1965's X-Men #14 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The machines were intentially programmed to locate, hunt, capture or kill mutants in an effort to rid them from the population. Sentinels are typically armed with energy weapons and restraining devices, have the ability to fly and can detect mutants at long ranges, while their bodies are also relatively impervious to damage. Later incarnations of Sentinels come with more specific upgrades to defeat certain mutants on the battle. What brought the X-Men specifically to space isn't immediately clear in the preview; although, Cyclops says that they're here to stop the Sentinel threat for \"forever\" so that the team \"might just have a shot at bringing Professor X's dream to life.\" Cyclops also says that the X-Men's home \"doesn't stand a chance if Trask gets his latest model online,\" which could explain how Wolverine was able to kill one of the robots with relative ease. Wolverine and Rogue also allude to a tragedy at X-Mansion seemingly caused by the Sentinels, as Rogue says she's there to let \"my fists do the thinkin'.\"  RELATED: A Long Dead X-Man has a Grudge With an Entire Mutant Family Dynasty While the X-Men are back in the nostalgic 1990s in X-Men '92: House of XCII, the five-issue series bring in some modern mutantkind developments as well. The synopsis for the first issue reads, \"Everyone\u2019s favorite \u201990s incarnations of the X-Men have returned\u2026but this time, everything is even all-newer and all-more different! Mutantkind is taking a huge leap forward by founding their own nation on the island of Krakoa, guided by Professor X, Magneto, and a mysterious long-lived woman who knows more than she should. That\u2019s right \u2013 the \u201990s X-Men are tackling the Krakoan Age thirty years early\u2026 and it\u2019s NOT going to go the way you expect!\"  X-Men '92: House of XCII #1 comes from writer Steve Foxe, artist Salva Espin, colorist Israel Silva and letterer VC's Joe Sabino, with cover art by Silva and David Balde\u00f3n and variant cover art by David Talaski, David Nakayama, Scott Williams and Sebastian Cheng. The issue releases on April 13 from Marvel.

Regardless of what decade or timeline he might be fighting in, there's nobody who can take down an enemy quite like Wolverine can.  In a preview for X-Men '92: House of XCII #1 provided by Marvel, the X-Men from the 1990s era have officially returned and are taking on any army of Sentinels in space. Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey all board an orbiting satellite to stop the Sentinel threat while Beast mans the Blackbird from above. Facing an army of the mutant-hunting robots created by Bolviar Trask, Wolverine manages to destory one of them in what appears to be a single blow. \"I thought I smelled scum,\" the character says as he's doing it. \"If Trask is on this station, I'm not wasting my time with these tin cans.\"  RELATED: Dark Ages Confirms Which X-Man Could Actually Kill Wolverine                                                                            The Sentinels first appeared in 1965's X-Men #14 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The machines were intentially programmed to locate, hunt, capture or kill mutants in an effort to rid them from the population. Sentinels are typically armed with energy weapons and restraining devices, have the ability to fly and can detect mutants at long ranges, while their bodies are also relatively impervious to damage. Later incarnations of Sentinels come with more specific upgrades to defeat certain mutants on the battle. What brought the X-Men specifically to space isn't immediately clear in the preview; although, Cyclops says that they're here to stop the Sentinel threat for \"forever\" so that the team \"might just have a shot at bringing Professor X's dream to life.\" Cyclops also says that the X-Men's home \"doesn't stand a chance if Trask gets his latest model online,\" which could explain how Wolverine was able to kill one of the robots with relative ease. Wolverine and Rogue also allude to a tragedy at X-Mansion seemingly caused by the Sentinels, as Rogue says she's there to let \"my fists do the thinkin'.\"  RELATED: A Long Dead X-Man has a Grudge With an Entire Mutant Family Dynasty While the X-Men are back in the nostalgic 1990s in X-Men '92: House of XCII, the five-issue series bring in some modern mutantkind developments as well. The synopsis for the first issue reads, \"Everyone\u2019s favorite \u201990s incarnations of the X-Men have returned\u2026but this time, everything is even all-newer and all-more different! Mutantkind is taking a huge leap forward by founding their own nation on the island of Krakoa, guided by Professor X, Magneto, and a mysterious long-lived woman who knows more than she should. That\u2019s right \u2013 the \u201990s X-Men are tackling the Krakoan Age thirty years early\u2026 and it\u2019s NOT going to go the way you expect!\"  X-Men '92: House of XCII #1 comes from writer Steve Foxe, artist Salva Espin, colorist Israel Silva and letterer VC's Joe Sabino, with cover art by Silva and David Balde\u00f3n and variant cover art by David Talaski, David Nakayama, Scott Williams and Sebastian Cheng. The issue releases on April 13 from Marvel.

Home Anime How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche    How Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami Embody the Elder Millennial Psyche  By Olufolahan Olowoyeye Published 23 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Drawing their convictions from alienation and resentment, Jujutsu Kaisen's Gojo and Nanami describe the experience of many elder Millennials.                 Two of the most celebrated elements of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen are its nuanced approach to character development and its heavy inspiration from contemporary culture. While the series frequently employs antipathy as a method of character development, instances of convergence in their motivations illustrate another method. This alternative approach is shown by the characters Gojo and Nanami, who, though differing wildly in appearance, behavior and histories, share certain generational quirks reminiscent of elder Millennials.  However, in line with the principal theme of Jujutsu Kaisen -- which illustrates the fundamental role of harnessing negativity in human life and culture -- what brings Gojo and Nanami together is less how they feel, but rather what they ultimately decide to do. In learning to draw conviction from alienation, disillusionment and resentment, Gojo and Nanami together describe a collective arc grounded in Millennial angst. RELATED: How Antipathy Drives Character Development in Jujutsu Kaisen          Kento Nanami: The Shaman Who Overcame His Resignation                 When Kento Nanami leaves Jujutsu sorcery for a traditional corporate job, two realizations follow: a life resigned to the empty pursuit of money stays empty, and that the little asked of workers in his position -- to perpetuate the inequality and absurdity of modern life -- is not enough to live on. The cognitive dissonance of these realizations comes to a head in a bakery where he has a negative epiphany familiar to many Millennials: he doesn\u2019t have to do anything. In essence, like many others in his position, Nanami doesn\u2019t have to make the world better, or do anything of any \u201creal\u201d value; instead, he is only incentivized to perpetuate the same absurdity and despair that feeds curses.  His decision becomes clear: seeing the curse perched on the young woman\u2019s shoulder, he could simply leave her to his fate. His sandwich is already paid for, so their business is over. Any surplus effort he invests is at his own cost. Until this moment, that was a source of despair for Nanami; by choosing to act instead, he renews his conviction and returns to his work. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Delivers a Thrilling & Emotional Prequel That Fans Will Love          Satoru Gojo's Main Character Syndrome                 Contrary to Nanami's gradual alienation in the workplace, Gojo's conviction in Jujutsu Kaisen stems from his personal experience of trauma and betrayal. Reeling from the shock and loss of his experiences with Geto and Yuta in Jujutsu High, Gojo transforms his own emptiness and resentment into a limitless thirst for personal power. While his ambition is in part motivated by a desire to give children like Yuta and Yuji the carefree childhood he lacked, his contempt for the elites of Jujutsu Sorcery adds another layer.  Like Nanami, dissatisfaction with the status quo has led Gojo to lose faith in the leadership and guidance of the previous generation. But unlike Nanami, this disillusionment is abrupt, traumatic and deeply personal, versus the more subtle and protracted disillusionment of working life. Similarly, just as Nanami's dry, straight-laced professionalism contrasts with his deep feeling, Gojo's own laid-back attitude contrasts with his profound megalomania. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen Shows What Happens When Three Domain Expansions Overlap Over the course of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo's antipathy for his superiors in Jujutsu sorcery -- illustrated by his blatant disrespect for Principal Yorinobu and others -- supplies critical context for his thirst for power and his arrogance. For Gojo, \"being the strongest\" is a role to which only he is truly \"fit,\" in that he can generate and sustain the conviction to do so. Like Nanami, this conviction takes root in alienation and disillusionment with the powers-that-be, but with an important distinction. While Nanami critiques the inhuman priorities of these powers, the source of Gojo's own grievances is their relative weakness.  Though Jujutsu Kaisen's manga and its adaptations alike work to distinguish these characters, their worldviews nevertheless converge in an unsettling, generational intuition: the world is deeply broken, those in charge of it have largely failed, and whatever responsibility to do differently rests solely in one's self.

Two of the most celebrated elements of Gege Akutami's Jujutsu Kaisen are its nuanced approach to character development and its heavy inspiration from contemporary culture. While the series frequently employs antipathy as a method of character development, instances of convergence in their motivations illustrate another method. This alternative approach is shown by the characters Gojo and Nanami, who, though differing wildly in appearance, behavior and histories, share certain generational quirks reminiscent of elder Millennials.  However, in line with the principal theme of Jujutsu Kaisen -- which illustrates the fundamental role of harnessing negativity in human life and culture -- what brings Gojo and Nanami together is less how they feel, but rather what they ultimately decide to do. In learning to draw conviction from alienation, disillusionment and resentment, Gojo and Nanami together describe a collective arc grounded in Millennial angst. RELATED: How Antipathy Drives Character Development in Jujutsu Kaisen          Kento Nanami: The Shaman Who Overcame His Resignation                 When Kento Nanami leaves Jujutsu sorcery for a traditional corporate job, two realizations follow: a life resigned to the empty pursuit of money stays empty, and that the little asked of workers in his position -- to perpetuate the inequality and absurdity of modern life -- is not enough to live on. The cognitive dissonance of these realizations comes to a head in a bakery where he has a negative epiphany familiar to many Millennials: he doesn\u2019t have to do anything. In essence, like many others in his position, Nanami doesn\u2019t have to make the world better, or do anything of any \u201creal\u201d value; instead, he is only incentivized to perpetuate the same absurdity and despair that feeds curses.  His decision becomes clear: seeing the curse perched on the young woman\u2019s shoulder, he could simply leave her to his fate. His sandwich is already paid for, so their business is over. Any surplus effort he invests is at his own cost. Until this moment, that was a source of despair for Nanami; by choosing to act instead, he renews his conviction and returns to his work. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Delivers a Thrilling & Emotional Prequel That Fans Will Love          Satoru Gojo's Main Character Syndrome                 Contrary to Nanami's gradual alienation in the workplace, Gojo's conviction in Jujutsu Kaisen stems from his personal experience of trauma and betrayal. Reeling from the shock and loss of his experiences with Geto and Yuta in Jujutsu High, Gojo transforms his own emptiness and resentment into a limitless thirst for personal power. While his ambition is in part motivated by a desire to give children like Yuta and Yuji the carefree childhood he lacked, his contempt for the elites of Jujutsu Sorcery adds another layer.  Like Nanami, dissatisfaction with the status quo has led Gojo to lose faith in the leadership and guidance of the previous generation. But unlike Nanami, this disillusionment is abrupt, traumatic and deeply personal, versus the more subtle and protracted disillusionment of working life. Similarly, just as Nanami's dry, straight-laced professionalism contrasts with his deep feeling, Gojo's own laid-back attitude contrasts with his profound megalomania. RELATED: Jujutsu Kaisen Shows What Happens When Three Domain Expansions Overlap Over the course of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo's antipathy for his superiors in Jujutsu sorcery -- illustrated by his blatant disrespect for Principal Yorinobu and others -- supplies critical context for his thirst for power and his arrogance. For Gojo, \"being the strongest\" is a role to which only he is truly \"fit,\" in that he can generate and sustain the conviction to do so. Like Nanami, this conviction takes root in alienation and disillusionment with the powers-that-be, but with an important distinction. While Nanami critiques the inhuman priorities of these powers, the source of Gojo's own grievances is their relative weakness.  Though Jujutsu Kaisen's manga and its adaptations alike work to distinguish these characters, their worldviews nevertheless converge in an unsettling, generational intuition: the world is deeply broken, those in charge of it have largely failed, and whatever responsibility to do differently rests solely in one's self.

Chapter 159 clarifies what he really wants to achieve.                  The following contains spoilers for One-Punch Man Chapter 159, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English at Viz Media.   One-Punch Man isn't lacking in characters with interesting power, fighting style or personality. However, not many of them offer depth. Most are simply there for the sake of entertainment, either as a gag or some form of mockery. Garo is one of the few who actually has a story to tell with a respectable background arc -- though his motivations are questionable.  When Garo made his debut, he announced he was siding with the monsters. He claimed to sympathize with the villains and vowed to destroy the heroes. However, his power was still lacking then so he sought to fight stronger opponents to hone himself and his skills. He challenged S-Class heroes and even hospitalized some of them, but he also defeated countless strong monsters and had wholesome moments along the way. One-Punch Man Chapter 159 finally clarifies whether Garo stands on the side of good or evil. RELATED: One-Punch Man: Saitama Just Pulled a Jimbei Move                After Centisennin and Evil Ocean Water were dealt with, Saitama went toward Garo and asked the Hero Hunter what exactly he is. But before he arrived, Garo recalled that the S-Class heroes were knocked out and yet to reappear. He assumed they were out of commission, supposedly meaning he no longer had anything to fear. Garo could finally perfect absolute evil using the martial art form he created. Despite this, he instead felt that there was something he was missing -- then Saitama arrived.  Garo did not recognize Saitama despite having met the bald hero a couple of times previously in One-Punch Man. He took a moment to think about Saitama's question, casting away his master's advice to follow his heart. Resolving himself to accomplish the task that he believed only he could do, he introduced himself as the monster Garo, then followed by claiming to cast all of humanity into the depths of despair and become the absolute evil. RELATED: One-Punch Man: A Dark & Twisted Backstory Led to Genos Becoming a Cyborg                Garo's decision isn't surprising, as he's always been dead set on pursuing the evil path. In fact, it's his primary motivation to get stronger. It's just that One-Punch Man has made it seem that Garo was finally turning over a new leaf. He painstakingly protected the kid Tareo on multiple occasions and even joined hands with Metal Bat -- someone he had a bad history with -- in order to defeat Centisennin. Garo also had some sort of enlightenment after going head-to-head against his former master, which allowed him to regain his humanity.  With Garo cementing his goal to be the ultimate evil, it's probably safe to assume that the only means to make him change his mind is to utterly destroy him. Fortunately, the most capable individual for that job is already on the scene.

Home Comics Comic Book Reviews AWA's The Joneses #1 Comic Review    AWA's The Joneses #1 Comic Review  By Dustin Holland Published 19 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Michael Moreci and Alessandro Vitti's The Joneses #1 introduces readers to a charming new superfamily.                 It seems safe to assume that pop culture will be dominated by reactions to the COVID Pandemic for years to come. Author Michael Moreci has already taken a significant amount of inspiration from the challenges of recent years. He and fellow author Tim Seeley recently worked together to create an apocalyptic horror movie. And now, Moreci has teamed up with artist Alessandro Vitti and AWA Studios to present a new five-part series set in the same universe as J. Michael Straczynski and Michael Deodato's The Resistance. The Joneses #1 is a compelling first issue that introduces readers to a new family of superheroes.  The Joneses #1 follows the Jones family as they struggle to balance their newfound superpowers with their everyday lives in an increasingly divided social climate. Many of their neighbors believe that people with superpowers are responsible for a recent public health crisis, known as \"the Great Death,\" that ravaged the world, so the Joneses are forced to hide who they really are even from their closest friends. As if that wasn't enough stress, the matriarch of the family is having an increasingly difficult time controlling her powers. As tensions rise, dangerous super villains emerge and each member of the family is forced to make difficult decisions.  Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                 Many readers will see shades of the real world in The Joneses #1. Moreci isn't subtle about the parallels between his fiction and reality. \"The Great Death\" feels like a hyperbolic version of the COVID pandemic. Similarly, the divisive nature of public discourse in The Joneses #1 seems to echo the state of the real world. This allegorical approach makes it easy for the reader to acclimate to the world of the comic, giving Moreci the freedom to flesh out his characters. As this first issue unfolds, he reveals more and more about the family's tense, but endearing dynamic. There is something cathartic about watching as a family tackles their personal problems in the wake of a global health crisis.  Vitti's art captures the tone of Moreci's work perfectly. His ability to depict a wide emotional range helps Moreci build tension throughout the numerous difficult conversations that comprise The Joneses #1. He's just as great at capturing the spirit of the landscape. His depictions of suburban Illinois evoke a quiet, almost pastoral feeling until further inspection reveals something sinister lurking behind the cookie-cutter houses. But Vitti's work really comes to life in the action sequences. He draws the daughter's super speed with a frenetic, excitable line that communicates the scope of her power while adding to the overall composition of each page.  Related: IDW's The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 Comic Review                 The Joneses #1 is a well-crafted, thoughtful meditation on life in the aftermath of catastrophe. It functions both as a satirical analysis of the current cultural zeitgeist and a good old-fashioned superhero story. Moreci and Vitti are both firing on all cylinders in this first issue, that has something in it for everyone.

It seems safe to assume that pop culture will be dominated by reactions to the COVID Pandemic for years to come. Author Michael Moreci has already taken a significant amount of inspiration from the challenges of recent years. He and fellow author Tim Seeley recently worked together to create an apocalyptic horror movie. And now, Moreci has teamed up with artist Alessandro Vitti and AWA Studios to present a new five-part series set in the same universe as J. Michael Straczynski and Michael Deodato's The Resistance. The Joneses #1 is a compelling first issue that introduces readers to a new family of superheroes.  The Joneses #1 follows the Jones family as they struggle to balance their newfound superpowers with their everyday lives in an increasingly divided social climate. Many of their neighbors believe that people with superpowers are responsible for a recent public health crisis, known as \"the Great Death,\" that ravaged the world, so the Joneses are forced to hide who they really are even from their closest friends. As if that wasn't enough stress, the matriarch of the family is having an increasingly difficult time controlling her powers. As tensions rise, dangerous super villains emerge and each member of the family is forced to make difficult decisions.  Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                 Many readers will see shades of the real world in The Joneses #1. Moreci isn't subtle about the parallels between his fiction and reality. \"The Great Death\" feels like a hyperbolic version of the COVID pandemic. Similarly, the divisive nature of public discourse in The Joneses #1 seems to echo the state of the real world. This allegorical approach makes it easy for the reader to acclimate to the world of the comic, giving Moreci the freedom to flesh out his characters. As this first issue unfolds, he reveals more and more about the family's tense, but endearing dynamic. There is something cathartic about watching as a family tackles their personal problems in the wake of a global health crisis.  Vitti's art captures the tone of Moreci's work perfectly. His ability to depict a wide emotional range helps Moreci build tension throughout the numerous difficult conversations that comprise The Joneses #1. He's just as great at capturing the spirit of the landscape. His depictions of suburban Illinois evoke a quiet, almost pastoral feeling until further inspection reveals something sinister lurking behind the cookie-cutter houses. But Vitti's work really comes to life in the action sequences. He draws the daughter's super speed with a frenetic, excitable line that communicates the scope of her power while adding to the overall composition of each page.  Related: IDW's The Rocketeer: The Great Race #1 Comic Review                 The Joneses #1 is a well-crafted, thoughtful meditation on life in the aftermath of catastrophe. It functions both as a satirical analysis of the current cultural zeitgeist and a good old-fashioned superhero story. Moreci and Vitti are both firing on all cylinders in this first issue, that has something in it for everyone.

The following contains spoilers for Platinum End, now streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, as well as dicsussion of suicide.   Platinum End, a thriller anime by the same creators as Death Note, stars the humble, pacifistic Kakehashi Mirai who aims to simply live a life of ordinary happiness -- and his efforts to win a divine battle royale to decide who will become the world's next God. It takes more than angel wings and red arrows to win this fight.  The story of Platinum End began as a fairly routine battle royale scenario with an angelic theme but soon expanded in scope and explored a variety of intriguing themes about the purpose of life, the cost of taking another life, the meaning of what God really is and far more. And these topics are explored in more than a few wild and unpredictable plot twists along the way. RELATED: Platinum End's Mirai is a Weak Protagonist - and It's Harming the Story          When Nasse Chose Mirai As A God Candidate                 The very first plot twist in Platinum End ranks among the most important. In fact, if it didn't take place, Mirai wouldn't have even been alive to witness the rest of the series. After graduating from middle school, the miserable Mirai was ready to end his own life and attempted to do so by falling off a skyscraper. That was when the playful but brutal angel Nasse literally swooped in to save his life, and Mirai vowed to make the most of what she did for him.  He was then chosen as one of the 13 God candidates who would fight over the throne of Heaven, launching the entire rest of Platinum End. From this point on, Mirai would fight to protect his own life and that of the people around him. Never again will he consider the self-destructive path. RELATED: Platinum End: Was It Muni Who Plotted to [SPOILER] Heaven?          When Mirai's Team Defeated Metropoliman                 Mirai's most powerful rival, the armored would-be hero Metropoliman, was poised to win the entire battle royale with his advanced arrow techniques and devious methods. This included sending his minion Hajime to take Mukaido Nanato's wife and daughter hostage. During the battle, Mirai and Saki finally turned the tables on Metropoliman and restrained him, which gave Mukaido a chance to use the last of his strength to slay the villain with a heavy machine gun.  Metropoliman's death did more than end the threat he posed -- it also shifted the battle royale's tone away from violence and toward debate and philosophical discussion, which is what Mirai preferred. But he wouldn't be the one to take charge of the upcoming debate. RELATED: How Biblically Accurate are the Angels in Platinum End?          When Yuito Susumu Called For A Peaceful Summit                 Not long after Metropoliman's death, the youngest God candidate, Yuito Susumu, made his move. He appeared on live TV and encouraged the remaining candidates to join him in peaceful talks on who should become God and why, a plan Mirai and his ally Saki cautiously agreed to.  This helped shift Platinum End from a battle anime to something more akin to its Death Note progenitor, complete with the use of media, mind games and schemes within schemes. Susumu meant well, but other God candidates such as Nakaumi Shuji and Professor Yoneda would complicate Susumu's efforts to vote peacefully for a new God. Soon, it was Yoneda who ran the show, not Susumu. RELATED: Platinum End: Mirai Prepares for His Final Battle - and He May Have to Kill          When Professor Yoneda Vowed To Kill The God Creature                 The brilliant but reclusive professor Yoneda Gaku, the final God candidate to appear, wanted to end the battle royale in a whole new way. He didn't want to fight and become a classist king like Metropoliman, nor did he desire to vote for a new God. Instead, the cynical Yoneda proposed a shocking new theory: that humans' collective prayers and emotions created God, similar to negative emotions creating curses in Jujutsu Kaisen, and Yoneda didn't want such a false deity to deceive humanity with false hope.  So he hatched a bold plan to slay most other God candidates, then have his ally Nakaumi and himself kill one another to ensure no one won the competition. This would ensure God would never be replaced, and the very idea of this being would die out. RELATED: Platinum End's Professor Yoneda Echoes Hyuga Neji's Darkest Beliefs in Naruto          When Nakaumi Destroyed Himself As God                 In the end, Nakaumi was chosen as the new God and ascended to the heavens as an enlightened being. There, he saw for himself just how many people across the world wanted to end their own lives and he felt powerless to aid them. That, combined with his own self-destructive desires, led God-Nakaumi to destroy himself with a giant white arrow -- then chaos ensued.  This had an apocalyptic impact not just on Platinum End's main characters, but all of humanity and the angels as well. Everyone was wiped out -- but in the end, Mirai and Saki died happily in each other's arms and achieved their true platinum end. They were the winners after all.

Metropoliman's death did more than end the threat he posed -- it also shifted the battle royale's tone away from violence and toward debate and philosophical discussion, which is what Mirai preferred. But he wouldn't be the one to take charge of the upcoming debate. RELATED: How Biblically Accurate are the Angels in Platinum End?          When Yuito Susumu Called For A Peaceful Summit                 Not long after Metropoliman's death, the youngest God candidate, Yuito Susumu, made his move. He appeared on live TV and encouraged the remaining candidates to join him in peaceful talks on who should become God and why, a plan Mirai and his ally Saki cautiously agreed to.  This helped shift Platinum End from a battle anime to something more akin to its Death Note progenitor, complete with the use of media, mind games and schemes within schemes. Susumu meant well, but other God candidates such as Nakaumi Shuji and Professor Yoneda would complicate Susumu's efforts to vote peacefully for a new God. Soon, it was Yoneda who ran the show, not Susumu. RELATED: Platinum End: Mirai Prepares for His Final Battle - and He May Have to Kill          When Professor Yoneda Vowed To Kill The God Creature                 The brilliant but reclusive professor Yoneda Gaku, the final God candidate to appear, wanted to end the battle royale in a whole new way. He didn't want to fight and become a classist king like Metropoliman, nor did he desire to vote for a new God. Instead, the cynical Yoneda proposed a shocking new theory: that humans' collective prayers and emotions created God, similar to negative emotions creating curses in Jujutsu Kaisen, and Yoneda didn't want such a false deity to deceive humanity with false hope.  So he hatched a bold plan to slay most other God candidates, then have his ally Nakaumi and himself kill one another to ensure no one won the competition. This would ensure God would never be replaced, and the very idea of this being would die out. RELATED: Platinum End's Professor Yoneda Echoes Hyuga Neji's Darkest Beliefs in Naruto          When Nakaumi Destroyed Himself As God                 In the end, Nakaumi was chosen as the new God and ascended to the heavens as an enlightened being. There, he saw for himself just how many people across the world wanted to end their own lives and he felt powerless to aid them. That, combined with his own self-destructive desires, led God-Nakaumi to destroy himself with a giant white arrow -- then chaos ensued.  This had an apocalyptic impact not just on Platinum End's main characters, but all of humanity and the angels as well. Everyone was wiped out -- but in the end, Mirai and Saki died happily in each other's arms and achieved their true platinum end. They were the winners after all.

Marvil's Devil's Reign #6   Artist  Marco Checchetto    Colorist  Marcio Menyz    Cover Artist  Marco Checchetto, Marcio Menyz    Letterer  VC's Clayton Cowles    Price  5.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Chip Zdarsky      The con is up. The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart.

Marvil's Devil's Reign #6   Artist  Marco Checchetto    Colorist  Marcio Menyz    Cover Artist  Marco Checchetto, Marcio Menyz    Letterer  VC's Clayton Cowles    Price  5.99    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Release Date  2022-04-06    Writer  Chip Zdarsky      The con is up. The duly elected mayor of New York City, Wilson Fisk, has been manipulating his voter base\u00a0and citizens' emotions, using the Purple Man\u2019s powers\u00a0while lobbying for a crime-free city by incarcerating superheroes without due process. Fisk\u00a0kills the man he thinks is responsible, Matt Murdock, aka\u00a0Daredevil, but it is Mike Murdock who dies. Unhinged and unraveled, Fisk lets his Thunderbolts run amuck and\u00a0sets the Purple Man on the remaining heroes, turning the whole city into a warzone. Written by Chip Zdarsky, with artwork from Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz and lettering by VC's Clayton Cowles, the Devil's Reign event from Marvel Comics comes to a bloody, battered end in Issue 6.  Devil's Reign #6 opens with chaotic scenes on the streets of New York. Under the influence of Mayor Fisk, the Thunderbolts task force and the alternate variants of Octavius launch an attack on the Avengers and the remaining superheroes, leading to an all-out brawl. Having absorbed the powers of his children, the Purple Man has become immensely powerful, turning a good half of the city against the masks and superpowered individuals. The heroes are outnumbered and outmaneuvered when suddenly the rest of the cavalry make their windfall appearance. Meanwhile, Fisk and Typhoid Mary attempt to run away when the Daredevils stop them in their tracks, leading to an epic showdown between the archenemies.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire #3 Comic Review                An epic showdown between heroes and villains is par for the course for comic finales.\u00a0Devil's Reign #6 may\u00a0use the standard trope, but there is order in the whirling chaos as concrete cracks and sparks of fire fill the air. The action-heavy finale splits into two narratives, questioning the morality of the choices that set heroes apart. Joe, the last remaining purple child, confronts his father in a heated battle, while an angry Daredevil savagely beats up\u00a0the disgraced Mayor. Writer Chip Zdarsky mixes that inner conflict with rage and grief, interlacing Daredevil\u2019s self-questioning narration over the events. Often, when drowning in despair, even the heroes can lose their way, but it is worth remembering that saving one's own soul is saving a life as well.  The artwork of Devil's Reign #6 is an orchestra of swashbuckling action, imposing panels, and pensive closeups. Artist Marco Checchetto and Marcio Menyz have been Zdarsky\u2019s partners-in-crime since the start of his Daredevil run, helping Zdarsky shape the world that eventually paved the way for the Devil\u2019s Reign event. From rage-filled smashes to energy clashes, it is not easy to depict a cohesive string of events in a battle zone, but Checchetto\u2019s seamless strokes and well-framed illustrations take the reader into the midst of the action. Similarly laudable is Menyz's use of colors, which portray a furiously heated atmosphere. The brightly colored characters against the backdrop of dusty, gritty wreckage create a contrasting feature in the artwork.  RELATED:\u00a0Marvel's Devil's Reign: X-Men #3 Comic Review                Devil's Reign #6 moves at an enthralling pace, taking the reader through a rollercoaster of emotions. A story with Daredevil and Wilson Fisk must have a bare-knuckle brawl between the two, and the issue delivers on that front. Yet the aftermath of the event follows a cliched trail that keeps the pre-existing status quo intact, leaving a lot to be desired. Meanwhile, some things have changed\u00a0as a consequence of Wilson's egomaniacal actions, as interesting developments bring in a new dawn for the Marvel universe. While great artwork adorns the book, Devil's Reign #6 ends on a promising yet rather generic conclusion as far as superhero comic events.

Home TV TV Features Young Justice's Newest LGBTQ Arc Has a Big Love Remix    Young Justice's Newest LGBTQ Arc Has a Big Love Remix  By Renaldo Matadeen Published 16 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Young Justice: Phantoms made bold steps in terms of LGBTQ+ representation, while also remixing HBO's Big Love with a key character.                  WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Young Justice: Phantoms Episodes 14-16, now streaming on HBO Max.  Young Justice has definitely been one of the more progressive cartoons in recent times. It's explored queer relationships with Kaldur and Wyynde, and Halo and Harper Row, for example. Not to mention, the show also detailed Halo's interest in Islam, painting a more cosmopolitan, inclusive animated series. That diversity is one of the main reasons fans are responding to the show. They simply love how there's a sense of identity and equality for viewers from various walks of life. Interestingly, with the second half of Phantoms now underway, Young Justice's newest LGBTQ arc has an intriguing remix on HBO's Big Love, not shying away from polyamorous marriages.  RELATED: Young Justice: Why Every Episode Features the Number '16'                 Big Love dealt with Bill Paxton's Bill, a religious man and aspiring politician, who had multiple wives. In the five seasons on HBO, their bonds brought a lot of drama to the table, with Bill's life becoming unhealthy due to all these different personalities clashing -- most of the time, for selfish reasons. It's the total opposite in Phantoms, though, when Lagoon Boy (aka La'gaan) was revealed to be part of a throuple. When Coral left her council meeting with Aquaman and all the other nobles, she rushed over to Lagoon Boy, hugging and kissing him. This produced a very sentimental moment because he warned her not to overexert herself in Atlantis' politics as it'd harm their unborn baby.  RELATED: Young Justice Bosses Reveal the Current Status of 'Off-Limits' DC Characters Seeing him caring for his pregnant wife brought his journey full-circle, proving how he matured since things ended with Miss Martian. He hated the now-deceased Superboy for a while afterwards, but this confirmed he matured. The bigger surprise came after a terrorist attack on the underwater capital When the rubble fell after Orm made moves to flex his power, another royal, Rodunn, was damaged. Shockingly, Coral rushed over to tend to him, reaffirming this was her other husband.                 Later, La'gaan would meet them at their home, kissing both and letting them know to take care of the baby. He was going off with Kaldur to investigate the arrival of Arion and Orm's possible scheme to take the throne once more like he always attempted, so he wanted that sense of reassurance by bidding them goodbye. This was quite a glorious moment because Young Justice once more confirmed it was all about representation.  It's most welcome, especially after shows like Voltron: Legendary Defender relegated Shiro's kiss and overall queer arc to just a couple brief scenes, while Netflix's Sheera and Catra only kissed when the series ended. These felt like diversity boxes were being ticked, but HBO Max and Warner Bros. are showing another culture where genuine, endearing poly-love is helping to render a story about true acceptance, which hopefully will see more screen time as the show progresses, whether in comics or TV. See how La'gaan's family life continues to unfold, with new episodes of Young Justice: Phantoms debuting Thursdays on HBO Max.

It was boring so I decided to write about things I love. On the geek side of things, I write about comics, cartoons, video games, television, movies and basically, all things nerdy. I also write about music in terms of punk, indie, hardcore and emo because well, they rock! If you're bored by now, then you also don't want to hear that I write for ESPN on the PR side of things. And yes, I've written sports for them too! Not bad for someone from the Caribbean, eh? To top all this off, I've scribed short films and documentaries, conceptualizing stories and scripts from a human interest and social justice perspective. Business-wise, I make big cheddar (not really) as a copywriter and digital strategist working with some of the top brands in the Latin America region.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Young Justice: Phantoms Episodes 14-16, now streaming on HBO Max.  Young Justice has definitely been one of the more progressive cartoons in recent times. It's explored queer relationships with Kaldur and Wyynde, and Halo and Harper Row, for example. Not to mention, the show also detailed Halo's interest in Islam, painting a more cosmopolitan, inclusive animated series. That diversity is one of the main reasons fans are responding to the show. They simply love how there's a sense of identity and equality for viewers from various walks of life. Interestingly, with the second half of Phantoms now underway, Young Justice's newest LGBTQ arc has an intriguing remix on HBO's Big Love, not shying away from polyamorous marriages.  RELATED: Young Justice: Why Every Episode Features the Number '16'                 Big Love dealt with Bill Paxton's Bill, a religious man and aspiring politician, who had multiple wives. In the five seasons on HBO, their bonds brought a lot of drama to the table, with Bill's life becoming unhealthy due to all these different personalities clashing -- most of the time, for selfish reasons. It's the total opposite in Phantoms, though, when Lagoon Boy (aka La'gaan) was revealed to be part of a throuple. When Coral left her council meeting with Aquaman and all the other nobles, she rushed over to Lagoon Boy, hugging and kissing him. This produced a very sentimental moment because he warned her not to overexert herself in Atlantis' politics as it'd harm their unborn baby.  RELATED: Young Justice Bosses Reveal the Current Status of 'Off-Limits' DC Characters Seeing him caring for his pregnant wife brought his journey full-circle, proving how he matured since things ended with Miss Martian. He hated the now-deceased Superboy for a while afterwards, but this confirmed he matured. The bigger surprise came after a terrorist attack on the underwater capital When the rubble fell after Orm made moves to flex his power, another royal, Rodunn, was damaged. Shockingly, Coral rushed over to tend to him, reaffirming this was her other husband.                 Later, La'gaan would meet them at their home, kissing both and letting them know to take care of the baby. He was going off with Kaldur to investigate the arrival of Arion and Orm's possible scheme to take the throne once more like he always attempted, so he wanted that sense of reassurance by bidding them goodbye. This was quite a glorious moment because Young Justice once more confirmed it was all about representation.  It's most welcome, especially after shows like Voltron: Legendary Defender relegated Shiro's kiss and overall queer arc to just a couple brief scenes, while Netflix's Sheera and Catra only kissed when the series ended. These felt like diversity boxes were being ticked, but HBO Max and Warner Bros. are showing another culture where genuine, endearing poly-love is helping to render a story about true acceptance, which hopefully will see more screen time as the show progresses, whether in comics or TV. See how La'gaan's family life continues to unfold, with new episodes of Young Justice: Phantoms debuting Thursdays on HBO Max.

People who come from a history of crime have a lot to deal with. As they do their best to live a clean life, they sometimes have to deal with their former checkered lives, such as vengeful enemies, temptations to make \"easy money\" and old compatriots trying to force them back into their old ways. Most stories surrounding the theme of redemption and trying to escape a life of crime usually end in tragedy, a sad reminder that crime doesn't pay.  Today's manga is anything but sad, serious or a cautionary tale. Sakamoto Days, written by Yuto Suzuki and published by Viz Media, is a silly romp surrounding the life of a former hitman named Sakamoto. He was not just any hitman but the greatest the Yakuza have ever seen. Sakamoto was dashing, deadly and an expert killer. But after starting a family, he is now out of shape and the only trigger he pulls is the one on a bar code scanner since, after leaving his life of crime, he opened a convenience store with his lovely wife and child. While he may have left the underworld behind him, the underworld has not forgotten Sakamoto. A figure from his past comes to his store and makes a request: \"return to the assassin world, or die!\"  RELATED: The Director of Escaflowne Was Also Behind This Old-School Sci-Fi Crime Anim                The first noticeable factor about Sakamoto Days is that the art style is reminiscent of Viz Media's 1990s manga. The linework is softer and has less of the in-your-face aesthetics that cover the pages of modern-day manga. Sakamoto Days is a crime story that feels less like the gritty work of such dramas as Gangsta or Black Lagoon and more like a '90s staple such as Fushigi Yugi or Yu Yu Hakusho. While this may be off-putting to some fans of modern manga, the juxtaposition of softness mixed with the plot's challenging crime themes is an amusing dualism.  It is also funny that the jokes are thrown at the reader at a mile-a-minute pace alongside the action, which usually involves Sakamoto dealing with the day-to-day struggles of life like going to the grocery store is as severe as an assassination mission. After all, old habits die hard. However, despite its comedic tones, Sakamoto Days is for an older teen audience and features some violent scenes that should be avoided by the younger readers in the crowd. Luckily for our out-of-shape former criminal, he has a loving family that helps him keep on the straight and narrow. One of the best things about this manga is its main lead characters. Sakamoto's wife, Aoi, is his rock throughout and while she does know of his dark past, she sees the good in him and makes it her life's mission to guide her husband to be the best man he can be.  RELATED: The Best Free Short Manga on Manga Plus                 Love can change a man and Sakamoto Days reminds readers that even those who have the shadiest of histories can find redemption. So, instead of being a hitman for the Yakuza, Sakamoto utilizes his quick reflexes for customer care and community service, even if he gets carried away at times -- much to the chagrin of his wife and readers' amusement. As for some of the secondary characters in this manga, such as fellow former assassin-turned-convenience-store-clerk Shin, not many unique traits can be spoken for. Most of the side characters are, for lack of a better term, just there.  Sakamoto Days does not reinvent the wheel when it comes to comedy manga. The jokes are serviceable, complete with slapstick humor and visual gags that induce chuckles. The action scenes are well put together but will not blow readers' minds. But as a fun diversion with a somewhat retro aesthetic, Sakamoto Days does not need to be revolutionary to be entertaining and sets out to tell a silly story about redemption. It's the white cake of comedy manga: simple, somewhat sweet and direct.

January's Marauders: Annual 2021 #1 by Steve Orlando and Creees Lee followed Captain Kate Pryde and Bishop as they assembled a new team with an altruistic mission to help at-risk mutants around the world. But before they were even finished recruiting, Kate discovered an ancient mysterium puzzle box containing a map and a message with potentially colossal implications about both the past and the future of mutant-kind. Now, Orlando is teaming up with artist Eleonora Carlini, colorist Matt Milla and letterer Ariana Maher to present Marauders #1, an exciting first issue full of surprises.  Marauders #1 begins when Kate Pryde follows the map from the puzzle box to a forgotten corner of Krakoa, where she comes face to face with the infamous Cassandra Nova. Kate still holds Professor Xavier's deranged twin sister responsible for the deaths of countless mutants in the attack on Genosha, but she is a reformist at heart, and Cassandra assures her that she \"couldn't hurt a mutant fly.\" So Nova becomes the final member of the Marauders and points them in the direction of hordes of mutants in need of assistance in outer space. Related: Marvel's X-Men: Red #1 Comic Review                 Orlando does a great job introducing readers to the new team of heroes without getting bogged down in exposition. By introducing the team to Cassandra Nova, Orlando is able to quickly introduce readers to each member of the team to catch readers up naturally. The tension between the Marauders and their powerful new teammate adds to the overall sense of danger and uncertainty that surrounds the team as they embark on a mission to confront the Shi'Ar. By maintaining such a fast pace, Orlando gives the reader a sense of the disorienting flurry of activity that Kate Pryde and her compatriots are struggling to respond to.  Carlini's art complements Orlando's writing perfectly. Her page designs bring the pain and chaos of the action to light in an entertaining, but empathetic way. When Kate and Bishop are trying to help a distraught mutant, Carlini perfectly balances the serious emotional implications of the situation with a thrilling action sequence. The scene that introduces Cassandra Nova is particularly compelling. Carlini reveals the controversial character with a large spread that makes her appear as monstrous as her reputation would suggest. But Carlini's best work in Marauders #1 can be found in her stunning depictions of outer space. She does an excellent job capturing the vast beauty of the landscape to underscore the epic science fiction side of this first issue.  Related: Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review                Marauders #1 ends with the titular heroes in a remarkably precarious position and sets the stage for a fast-paced series. Whether they are exploring the wilds of Krakoa or rocketing into the far reaches of space, the Marauders are intriguing and easy to root for.

January's Marauders: Annual 2021 #1 by Steve Orlando and Creees Lee followed Captain Kate Pryde and Bishop as they assembled a new team with an altruistic mission to help at-risk mutants around the world. But before they were even finished recruiting, Kate discovered an ancient mysterium puzzle box containing a map and a message with potentially colossal implications about both the past and the future of mutant-kind. Now, Orlando is teaming up with artist Eleonora Carlini, colorist Matt Milla and letterer Ariana Maher to present Marauders #1, an exciting first issue full of surprises.  Marauders #1 begins when Kate Pryde follows the map from the puzzle box to a forgotten corner of Krakoa, where she comes face to face with the infamous Cassandra Nova. Kate still holds Professor Xavier's deranged twin sister responsible for the deaths of countless mutants in the attack on Genosha, but she is a reformist at heart, and Cassandra assures her that she \"couldn't hurt a mutant fly.\" So Nova becomes the final member of the Marauders and points them in the direction of hordes of mutants in need of assistance in outer space. Related: Marvel's X-Men: Red #1 Comic Review                 Orlando does a great job introducing readers to the new team of heroes without getting bogged down in exposition. By introducing the team to Cassandra Nova, Orlando is able to quickly introduce readers to each member of the team to catch readers up naturally. The tension between the Marauders and their powerful new teammate adds to the overall sense of danger and uncertainty that surrounds the team as they embark on a mission to confront the Shi'Ar. By maintaining such a fast pace, Orlando gives the reader a sense of the disorienting flurry of activity that Kate Pryde and her compatriots are struggling to respond to.  Carlini's art complements Orlando's writing perfectly. Her page designs bring the pain and chaos of the action to light in an entertaining, but empathetic way. When Kate and Bishop are trying to help a distraught mutant, Carlini perfectly balances the serious emotional implications of the situation with a thrilling action sequence. The scene that introduces Cassandra Nova is particularly compelling. Carlini reveals the controversial character with a large spread that makes her appear as monstrous as her reputation would suggest. But Carlini's best work in Marauders #1 can be found in her stunning depictions of outer space. She does an excellent job capturing the vast beauty of the landscape to underscore the epic science fiction side of this first issue.  Related: Marvel's Spider-Punk #1 Comic Review                Marauders #1 ends with the titular heroes in a remarkably precarious position and sets the stage for a fast-paced series. Whether they are exploring the wilds of Krakoa or rocketing into the far reaches of space, the Marauders are intriguing and easy to root for. The entire creative team works together to craft an excellent first issue that is sure to have fans hooked from the very first panel.
