Wow\u2026\u201d \r Spoilers for the show below.                          \r Toradora is a show, certainly an anime, definitely something that occurred in a time and place.  I think what happens in it is sort of besides the point. You can stick Ryuji, Taiga, and every other character into a Jane Austen novel and the only thing that would change would be the setting, and I mean that in a good way. Jane Austen is a dope writer, and Toradora has that feel about it, the way every plot thread is tied together in a seamless fashion, the way that it presents an idealistic relationship without it feeling unrealistic. It may not have y\u2019know, the same subtlety and nuance, but it can\u2019t really afford that in a twenty minute runtime per episode, and it\u2019s still able to deliver moments like with Ryuji\u2019s mother, when he's giving him a piece of his mind, and it\u2019s a heart-breaking scene, and probably the best moment in the show \u2013 even though you can make the argument that some scenes are more important to the story \u2013 because you can sympathise with Yasuko in this moment, it must hurt hearing that from your own son, someone who you\u2019ve raised with love, and who then turns around and serves you a harsh reality check. So, when she starts crying, you know why and you feel that emotional connection, without y\u2019know having to be held hostage to a fifteen-minute backstory like in Re:Zero telling you their whole life story. The economy of the writing, the way in which it gets to its point in a timely fashion, is probably why Toradora is the best romance anime ever made, because it doesn\u2019t tease out its plot longer than it needs to be.  \r You could criticise Toradora for a number of exaggerations and contrivances, but if I were to make those points it would just come across as disingenuous, because it goes against the show\u2019s intentions. I mean I could just toss in acknowledgements of the fact that, wow its such a coincidence that Ryuji and Taiga live next to each other, but I mean every romance in history has to pull this stunt in order for there to be a story, and I could also go on and say that the fact that their relationship realistically speaking should\u2019ve been wrapped up by episode eight, but I wouldn\u2019t mean either of these criticisms because I know that they don\u2019t matter to anyone\u2019s enjoyment. Toradora\u2019s primary aim isn\u2019t to provide wish fulfilment in the form of a fictional romantic relationship, it\u2019s to tell a story, and it takes the same approach Jane Austen takes in making the relationship the goal, which in my opinion, the best way to tell these kinds of romance stories. I mean you can wish all you want for an anime to depict a relationship beyond a confession and a kiss, but when that wish comes true it never ends well. Horimiya is mid, and Golden Time is too busy trying to call the Ghostbusters on Banri to tell a story worth listening to. Arguably the only good anime adaptation that breaks that trend is Kare Kano, but if you have to treat the last six episodes as if they didn\u2019t exist, can you really call it a good show? \r Regardless, when you have the relationship as the goal, one of the perks is that you give something for the viewer to look forward to, to see that relationship fulfilled. Now of course, you have to make sure you actually follow through on that promise, which Toradora does. Its ending is one of the best of all time, and its what elevates it beyond its contemporaries, and its what makes the show a classic, and its what makes the show worthwhile to watch. \r Many people have the Tatami Galaxy as one of their favourite anime, and although you may not feel the same way as them, if you watch the show, there\u2019s a moment that you can point to as the reason as to why they like it. Now the reason why it doesn\u2019t seem like Toradora is all that good in hindsight, long after you\u2019ve finished the show, is that Toradora lacks a defining moment that encapsulates what the show is about. It waxes lyrical on the theme of love, but all its message has to say really is just to have patience. With Toradora it\u2019s a lot harder to pinpoint its moment of greatness, because it doesn\u2019t reside in one detail, but rather in the big picture. Every character interaction, every line of dialogue, every animation number, and every note of music line up to create something that is more than the sum of its parts, and you can only really fully appreciate it when its still fresh in your memory. The story isn\u2019t complex, but it doesn\u2019t have to be, because its execution gives you too good of a time watching to really care. \r That may not be what you seek out of an artistic venture, but as entertainment, I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.

Wow\u2026\u201d \r Spoilers for the show below.                          \r Toradora is a show, certainly an anime, definitely something that occurred in a time and place.  I think what happens in it is sort of besides the point. You can stick Ryuji, Taiga, and every other character into a Jane Austen novel and the only thing that would change would be the setting, and I mean that in a good way. Jane Austen is a dope writer, and Toradora has that feel about it, the way every plot thread is tied together in a seamless fashion, the way that it presents an idealistic relationship without it feeling unrealistic. It may not have y\u2019know, the same subtlety and nuance, but it can\u2019t really afford that in a twenty minute runtime per episode, and it\u2019s still able to deliver moments like with Ryuji\u2019s mother, when he's giving him a piece of his mind, and it\u2019s a heart-breaking scene, and probably the best moment in the show \u2013 even though you can make the argument that some scenes are more important to the story \u2013 because you can sympathise with Yasuko in this moment, it must hurt hearing that from your own son, someone who you\u2019ve raised with love, and who then turns around and serves you a harsh reality check. So, when she starts crying, you know why and you feel that emotional connection, without y\u2019know having to be held hostage to a fifteen-minute backstory like in Re:Zero telling you their whole life story. The economy of the writing, the way in which it gets to its point in a timely fashion, is probably why Toradora is the best romance anime ever made, because it doesn\u2019t tease out its plot longer than it needs to be.  \r You could criticise Toradora for a number of exaggerations and contrivances, but if I were to make those points it would just come across as disingenuous, because it goes against the show\u2019s intentions. I mean I could just toss in acknowledgements of the fact that, wow its such a coincidence that Ryuji and Taiga live next to each other, but I mean every romance in history has to pull this stunt in order for there to be a story, and I could also go on and say that the fact that their relationship realistically speaking should\u2019ve been wrapped up by episode eight, but I wouldn\u2019t mean either of these criticisms because I know that they don\u2019t matter to anyone\u2019s enjoyment. Toradora\u2019s primary aim isn\u2019t to provide wish fulfilment in the form of a fictional romantic relationship, it\u2019s to tell a story, and it takes the same approach Jane Austen takes in making the relationship the goal, which in my opinion, the best way to tell these kinds of romance stories.

                       This series is about Yuki. I also think it is the best of the 3 seasons of Fruits Basket. I am also biased as I have a lot of admiration for Yuki. Maybe it\u2019s because I relate to him so much, the feeling of wanting to be liked but not having the words or confidence in them to say it aloud. Or just feeling like anything that you say is meaningless anyway and a sense of worthlessness behind everything. \r Yuki pushes himself through the fear and insecurities, instead of giving up which is the easiest way, and does something he doesn\u2019t want to do: become student council president. The only way of overcoming fear is by facing it head-on and doing something even if it would cause hardship and worry. It\u2019s heart-warming the bonds he forms with Manabe and Kuragi, but also the strength he shows to stand up to Akito, a person he fears the most. He finds self-worth throughout and gives hope to those watching, helping others to not give up either.\r Blending deep character development with powerful drama, this series can go from sadness to laughter, in an exhilarating ride. There aren\u2019t many series where I wish it would go on forever, but this is one of them.

And even then they manage to make it a dumb joke. I wouldn't \r recommend it to anyone. Avoid. \r      Until you watched every other interesting anime show. When you'll have nothing else to watch. Gintama parodies seinen, and manga/anime as a whole, by creating the ultimate one. It's a mix of some of the best-written characters and stories; silly, dumb, and absolutely hilarious comedy; brutal and bloody action; and a hell of an emotional rollercoaster joyride.
