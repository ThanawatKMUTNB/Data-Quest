Anime.  \r AOT is fundamentally bringing anime into the mainstream and it's only a matter of time until anime is going to be a worldwide phenomenon. Now, some may argue that Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, or even Your Name may be responsible for bringing anime into the eyes of the mainstream. However, not taking anything away from those series and films, AOT is consistently breaking into the eyes and ears of the mainstream and serves to introduce the next generation of anime fans to the medium. \r Intro\r Now, unto the review! AOT Part 2 takes place right where we left off in part 1. Who would have thought! Were thrusted right into one of the most intense, confusing, and chaotic battles in the show. Marley Vs. Paradis Vs. Eren. Throughout the first couple of episodes, I found it hard to decide who to root for. Our heroes who have been with us since the beginning? Marley, a force including many sympathetic characters trying to stop Eren? Or Eren? It's these choices that always kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to see how this would turn out. \r Animation/Jaw-Dropping Action\r The battles and fights throughout the season were expertly crafted and animated by MAPPA. And hats off to all the staff there; truly great work that won't ever be forgotten. Zeke's entrance during the second episode was scary, beautiful, and badass. Zeke raining down rocks onto the enemy was portrayed so well. The fear in the soldier's eyes, the Jaw Titan getting blasted, and Yelena's amazed reaction all contribute to setting an amazing tone. However, MAPPA has also significantly improved Titan battles. Eren Vs. Reiner is great. Their powerful punches and kicks echo throughout the battlefield and their battle cries blast into the ears of everyone. However, the best battle in the show comes in the second to last episode of the season. This episode had me starstruck. Annie and Reiner smashing bad guys, Mikasa, Jean, and Conney slashing up the enemy, Falco's reveal, and Floch's charge are spectacular and once again I am consistently amazed by the MAPPA staff. \r Narrative and Character Analysis\r However, the real meat in this show is the engaging and addicting narrative and its multi-dimensional and complex characters. Eren's ultimate goal throughout the season is to usurp complete control of the Founding Titan, ditch Zeke, and use its powers to destroy the \"enemies\" of the island. Now, thoughts aside from taking sides, it is absolutly incredible how the writing is able to stir such a debate. Some of my friends being sympathetic to Eren and his goals, and some of my friends being completely against him. AOT, demonstrates through its writing, how much of a masterclass story this truly is. Moreover, its characters are some of the best in the medium. Jean, consistently throws away a comfy life in favor of following his friends and morals. While he may not get as much focus as Eren, Zeke, or Gabi, his leadership abilities, courage, and determination make him stand out as one of the best supporting characters in the show. Zeke, is a troubled adult who is hellbent on proving to Eren he was manipulated by his Father. However, Zeke's realization that Eren had formed his own morals and goals without the influence of his father is shocking and showcases Zeke's deepest fears. Gabi is my personal favorite character in the season. Her transformation into a flawed hero is masterful and emotional. When she saves Kaya in a similar manner to Sasha saving her in season 2, I was convinced Gabi was the incarnation of the show's identity and spirit. Long story short: I cried during that scene lmao. \r Conclusion \r Overall, this show is a masterpiece that has been expertly been crafted for almost 10 years. So many times throughout this season and seasons prior I was convinced this show had the potential to explode and bring anime into the mainstream. And look where it is now: trending on Twitter several days a week, news articles praising its writing, and anime fans not shutting up about it for 13 weeks. It's been a hell of ride folks, see ya some time in the future!

Now, some may argue that Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, or even Your Name may be responsible for bringing anime into the eyes of the mainstream. However, not taking anything away from those series and films, AOT is consistently breaking into the eyes and ears of the mainstream and serves to introduce the next generation of anime fans to the medium. \r Intro\r Now, unto the review! AOT Part 2 takes place right where we left off in part 1. Who would have thought! Were thrusted right into one of the most intense, confusing, and chaotic battles in the show. Marley Vs. Paradis Vs. Eren. Throughout the first couple of episodes, I found it hard to decide who to root for. Our heroes who have been with us since the beginning? Marley, a force including many sympathetic characters trying to stop Eren? Or Eren? It's these choices that always kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to see how this would turn out. \r Animation/Jaw-Dropping Action\r The battles and fights throughout the season were expertly crafted and animated by MAPPA. And hats off to all the staff there; truly great work that won't ever be forgotten. Zeke's entrance during the second episode was scary, beautiful, and badass. Zeke raining down rocks onto the enemy was portrayed so well. The fear in the soldier's eyes, the Jaw Titan getting blasted, and Yelena's amazed reaction all contribute to setting an amazing tone. However, MAPPA has also significantly improved Titan battles. Eren Vs. Reiner is great. Their powerful punches and kicks echo throughout the battlefield and their battle cries blast into the ears of everyone. However, the best battle in the show comes in the second to last episode of the season. This episode had me starstruck. Annie and Reiner smashing bad guys, Mikasa, Jean, and Conney slashing up the enemy, Falco's reveal, and Floch's charge are spectacular and once again I am consistently amazed by the MAPPA staff. \r Narrative and Character Analysis\r However, the real meat in this show is the engaging and addicting narrative and its multi-dimensional and complex characters. Eren's ultimate goal throughout the season is to usurp complete control of the Founding Titan, ditch Zeke, and use its powers to destroy the \"enemies\" of the island. Now, thoughts aside from taking sides, it is absolutly incredible how the writing is able to stir such a debate. Some of my friends being sympathetic to Eren and his goals, and some of my friends being completely against him. AOT, demonstrates through its writing, how much of a masterclass story this truly is. Moreover, its characters are some of the best in the medium. Jean, consistently throws away a comfy life in favor of following his friends and morals. While he may not get as much focus as Eren, Zeke, or Gabi, his leadership abilities, courage, and determination make him stand out as one of the best supporting characters in the show. Zeke, is a troubled adult who is hellbent on proving to Eren he was manipulated by his Father. However, Zeke's realization that Eren had formed his own morals and goals without the influence of his father is shocking and showcases Zeke's deepest fears. Gabi is my personal favorite character in the season. Her transformation into a flawed hero is masterful and emotional. When she saves Kaya in a similar manner to Sasha saving her in season 2, I was convinced Gabi was the incarnation of the show's identity and spirit. Long story short: I cried during that scene lmao. \r Conclusion \r Overall, this show is a masterpiece that has been expertly been crafted for almost 10 years. So many times throughout this season and seasons prior I was convinced this show had the potential to explode and bring anime into the mainstream. And look where it is now: trending on Twitter several days a week, news articles praising its writing, and anime fans not shutting up about it for 13 weeks.
