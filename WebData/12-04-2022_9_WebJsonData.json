You know that\u2019s a flag that something bad is going to happen in reality.In reality, Milo is in bad shape after being shot by so many arrows. He\u2019s Rusting, so bad it temporarily blinded him.Bisco is taking care of him. He lies to Milo, saying he was able to make an injection of the Rust-Eater, which is what he gave Milo to treat him. Truth is, that was the injection that Pawoo gave to Bisco for Bisco to use. He\u2019s lying so Milo accepts it, of course, and doesn\u2019t feel guilty.In actuality, Bisco is dying pretty bad from the Rusting.Milo asks how Pawoo and Jabi are doing. Bisco lies again and says he\u2019s confident they\u2019re both okay. Then Milo asks Bisco if he wants to date his sister. Bisco gets embarrassed.Milo can sense Bisco will leave him to go settle things with Kurokawa, which could mean Bisco\u2019s death. He tries to make Bisco promise to stay so that when Milo gets well they can fight/die together. Bisco agrees, again lying. Bisco feels like he knows how Jabi felt taking care of him. He\u2019s helped Milo grow, and would die for him.So he takes off on Actagawa to kill Kurokawa.Pawoo follows a Kurokawa convoy that seems suspiciously powerful.Kurokawa, meanwhile, takes Jabi as a prisoner to one of his bases. He explains that he actually spreads an artificial Rust Wind, so that more people get the disease, meaning more medicine the government gets to sell. Kurokawa can create the Ruse because his base holds a defunct Tetsujin with a Rust reactor inside.This base has a Ganesha Cannon to shoot Rust Bullets far and wide, spreading the Rust Wind. Kurokawa plans to hit Weeping Child Ravine and destroy any Rust-Eater mushrooms there.\u00a0Kurokawa then asks Jabi to sell out fellow Mushroom Keepers so Kurokawa can have their blood, the important Rust-Eater ingredient. If Jabi doesn\u2019t comply, Kurokawa says he\u2019ll shoot the Rust Bullet right at the Mushroom Keeper village.Jabi answers Kurokawa with a headbutt! Yes! Kurokawa almost shoots Jabi, but one of his bunny lackeys gets in the way and starts beating up Jabi instead. Then it\u2019s revealed that the bunny lackey is actually Bisco in disguise! He gets the jump on Kurokawa and stabs him in the foot!Bisco throws Kurokawa, but he lands on a scaffold instead of the Rust lava.Bisco instructs Jabi to go destroy the Ganesha Cannon while he deals with Kurokawa. Bisco and Jabi hug as if it\u2019s the final goodbye.Outside, Jabi is met with a boxing gorilla. Luckily Pawoo comes in out of nowhere to beat it up.Then Bisco has his showdown with Kurokawa. Kurokawa\u2019s able to shoot him in the eye, and throws some crazy muscle guy at Bisco. But Bisco keeps going, and drops the muscle guy in the lava pretty hilariously.But he also loses his fingers to the Rust.Bisco gives him a chance to run, for some stupid reason, and gets shot more by Kurokawa. But he\u2019s like a demon possessed and keeps going, even when his arm breaks off.Before Kurokawa can get a killing shot on Bisco, Milo swoops in and shoots Kurokawa\u2019s arm off with an arrow. Then Bisco bites into Kurokawa\u2019s neck like a vampire and they both fall into the lava.Kurokawa finally dies, the bastard! But Bisco slowly dies, too. He\u2019s somehow able to have a sweet last goodbye with Milo as his body melts away. Milo mercy kills him.I can\u2019t believe they killed off Bisco!

She\u2019s still overwhelmed by all this kindness from Cayna. It\u2019s never explained about where she came from/what happened to her parents/why she\u2019s not traumatized from everyone she knows dying and turning into zombies\u2026 but we can just skip all that, I guess.After Cayna introduces Luka to Felskeilo, she brings her to see Mai-mai and Lonti. Both are surprised Cayna has a new daughter, but Mai-mai welcomes her as her new little sister. Roxilius also introduces himself. And Lonti gets flustered because she finds him cute.Cayna mentions she\u2019s going to settle in a village away from Felskeilo. Then she visits Skargo, who\u2019s silly as usual with all his effects. Last, she visits Kartatz. Kartatz welcomes his new little sister with a head pat, just as Cayna head-pats him! Cayna takes this opportunity to get plenty of lumber from Kartatz for her new house. She\u2019s able to store it away easily in her player inventory.Next up, Cayna visits Elineh and the Flame Spears. Also informing them where she\u2019s settling. They\u2019re a little disappointed that Cayna didn\u2019t take up their offer to join the Flame Spears, because of course you\u2019d want an OP member that could kill any monster. Anyways, Elineh recommends Cayna to go to his shop if she needs furnishing for her new home.Cayna goes to the shop and meets a kobold woman named Armuna who is the manager. Cayna\u2019s surprised to learn she\u2019s Elineh\u2019s wife. The shop they own is like Amazon.As a surprise present, Elineh instructed Armuna to give Cayna the first item she wanted for free. And Cayna wanted the carriage from her escort trip. Lucky first item!\u00a0Back at the inn, Rox offers to take care of Luka and the new home for Cayna. But Rox points out that Luka probably needs a female attendant as well, meaning Cayna has to summon Roxine, or as Cayna calls her, Cie. Cayna instructs her to watch over Luka.Then Rox and Cie start arguing immediately. Cayna gives them a good bonk and lectures them not to fight.\u00a0The next day, Cayna combines some artificial horse summons with her new carriage and basically makes a car. It takes them to the village.Cayna explains to Marelle that she has a new daughter and they\u2019ll be settling there. Lytt is happy to make friends with a new kid.Cayna also checks up on Mimily, who has started a new laundry service for the villagers.\u00a0Anyways, Marelle mentions that they have to make preparations for yet another party - the excuse this time is to welcome Cayna\u2019s family living in the village! Meaning another night of drinking, which scares Cayna.

They\u2019re accompanied by Carla and Owen.Their first stop is the old slums. Owen is worried that it\u2019s a bad route to take, but Souma shows them that because of his infrastructure work, the place has changed greatly. Kids are even playing in the street safely.Souma worked on improving sanitation. In part, by tearing down the old buildings and creating new ones. It\u2019s kind of unrealistic how fast he was able to make that happen, but okay.Then the subject turns to pathogens that cause disease, little things that can\u2019t be seen. It wasn\u2019t easy for Souma to convince this world of the problem. But there\u2019s actually a three-eyed race that can see them. And they agreed to help Souma.They\u2019ve even started making modern medicine like antibiotics.These are being called three-eyedine instead of medicine. They require gelins, which are plants. Tomoe actually helped by talking to the gelins to learn more about them.Then Hilde Norg shows up, sterilizing everything. She\u2019s from the three-eyed race and a doctor, basically.Next location Souma\u2019s group stops by is the job training center run by Ginger. We see Ginger and San teaching kids. They teach adults too, but it\u2019s been harder to get them wanting to learn reading, writing and math. Souma\u2019s hope is that they nurture many Number Ones.The last stop in the ep is outside the castle walls, at the refugee camp. Most refugees came after fleeing the Demon Lord\u2019s expansion.They stumble on some bad guys who were trying to kidnap refugee children!So Souma\u2019s group helps fight them back. Yuno happens to be there, and Souma helps save her. But he gets scolded by both Liscia and Yuno for such dangerous behavior. Yuno also tries to figure out that it\u2019s Souma under that adventurer disguise.A crowd comes to thank them, and Souma is able to redirect the praise to Yuno\u2019s group of adventurers.

They need people who can read, write, and do math. Seems Souma has some secret plan to get those people.Cut to the narrator who briefly explains that slavery exists in the continent\u00a0 Landia, and slaves tend to be abused. The he introduces a new character - slave trader Ginger Camus.Ginger introduces himself to some slaves that used to belong to his grandfather. He explains that he inherited his grandpa\u2019s slave trade business.They\u2019re all really down. Because his grandfather treated them kindly, and they don\u2019t know what will happen to them now that he\u2019s gone.This is explained to Ginger by a raccoon person slave named Sandria, who Ginger nicknames San. She also says his grandfather thought Ginger would be too kind to do this business. Ginger agrees. He wishes he could start a new different business.For speaking out, San believes she should be punished with a whip. But Ginger is shocked and doesn\u2019t agree to that.San wants the best for these slaves. He promises to screen the slave traders who want to buy them. He also starts educating them to do math, read, and write. He hopes this will increase their value so they are taken care of with kindness.At first, sales of slaves are not good. Ginger says he can read people well, and he can tell these people will not take good care of his slaves.The next day, four nobles come into the shop in a panic, saying they need to buy Ginger\u2019s slaves. They explain that King Souma has decreed that nobles/knights will be evaluated and promoted/demoted based on the ability to govern a territory. And governance requires\u2026 office skills.Ginger says they can buy the slaves as long as they don\u2019t break up families.So all of them are sold to good owners. And San is the only one left. Ginger and San sit down together and have tea when they\u2019re interrupted by Souma in disguise.Souma asks to buy San. San cares for Ginger and wants him to have seed money for his new business. So she requests the buyer give a large sum for her. And Souma drops a hefty bag of money.But Ginger declines. Because he wants San to stay with him. He loves her back.Souma reveals himself, and Roroa and Aisha come inside, too. Supposedly this was a test, but how they knew Ginger and San had a close relationship is not explained. Weird.Souma praises him for educating his slaves and hires him to be a civil servant at the director of the first ever job training center.This was Souma\u2019s secret plan to gradually eradicate slavery.

Or something. He suspects the trade goods coming into Delunio from Marden are fraudulent, as in, coming from eastern countries.Zenovia denies this, so Sirgis threatens to take it up with Wein. And Wein happens to make one of his surprise heroic arrivals at the meeting. He too denies they\u2019re fraudulent.Sirgis says these fraudulent clothes are a problem against the Levetian religion. But Wein points out that Sirgis isn\u2019t a Holy Elite, so who cares what he says. Sirgis leaves in a huff but says they\u2019ll regret it.Next up, Wein and Ninym continue on their trip to Phitcha, the capital of Soljest. If Wein can start up trade between Marden and Soljest, it would be another boon for Natra\u2019s economy.Wein meets with King Gruyere, who travels from place to place by having his servants pick up his throne.\u00a0Fat bastard.Wein secretly hopes to make an alliance with Gruyere so that their two kingdoms can defeat Delunio.Gruyere says they can speak during their meal. The meal has an unexpected attendee in Gruyere\u2019s daughter, Tolcheila.Wein gets distracted by all the amazing Soljest cuisine, and he doesn\u2019t get a chance to broach the subject of an alliance.Meanwhile, Zenovia gets a letter from Sirgis that Delunio wants back the land that they lent Marden, now that Marden is gone. Zenovia says no to this. Her vassal warns this might lead to war, but she doubts that will happen.The next day, Wein again tries to begin serious talks with Gruyere, but Gruyere gives him the cold shoulder all day long. He\u2019s avoiding Wein. Which is weird, because Gruyere is the one who invited him. Wein can tell something is up.Finally, Gruyere asks to meet Wein and Ninym on a balcony. Wein and Ninym are ready to take hostile action if that\u2019s the road Gruyere goes down.Gruyere surprises Wein by saying he doesn\u2019t care that Levetian scriptures look down on Flahms.\u00a0It seems Gruyere isn\u2019t some mindless religious zealot.Now Wein definitely wants an alliance with Gruyere, and he requests one. And without any debate, Gruyere agrees to it! Again, Wein is surprised with how easy this is.Turns out Gruyere was just being two-faced. He was already working with Sirgis, who was hiding on the balcony.Back in Natra,\u00a0 Wein and Ninym get a message that Delunio is attacking Marden, and Soljest\u2019s military is coming to help Delunio forces attack Natra.Wein meets with Zenovia. She apologizes for how this turned out, and requests to try to reconcile with Delunio to fix this matter. Wein agrees to this.

She apologizes for how this turned out, and requests to try to reconcile with Delunio to fix this matter. Wein agrees to this.

Or something. He suspects the trade goods coming into Delunio from Marden are fraudulent, as in, coming from eastern countries.Zenovia denies this, so Sirgis threatens to take it up with Wein. And Wein happens to make one of his surprise heroic arrivals at the meeting. He too denies they\u2019re fraudulent.Sirgis says these fraudulent clothes are a problem against the Levetian religion. But Wein points out that Sirgis isn\u2019t a Holy Elite, so who cares what he says. Sirgis leaves in a huff but says they\u2019ll regret it.Next up, Wein and Ninym continue on their trip to Phitcha, the capital of Soljest. If Wein can start up trade between Marden and Soljest, it would be another boon for Natra\u2019s economy.Wein meets with King Gruyere, who travels from place to place by having his servants pick up his throne.\u00a0Fat bastard.Wein secretly hopes to make an alliance with Gruyere so that their two kingdoms can defeat Delunio.Gruyere says they can speak during their meal. The meal has an unexpected attendee in Gruyere\u2019s daughter, Tolcheila.Wein gets distracted by all the amazing Soljest cuisine, and he doesn\u2019t get a chance to broach the subject of an alliance.Meanwhile, Zenovia gets a letter from Sirgis that Delunio wants back the land that they lent Marden, now that Marden is gone. Zenovia says no to this. Her vassal warns this might lead to war, but she doubts that will happen.The next day, Wein again tries to begin serious talks with Gruyere, but Gruyere gives him the cold shoulder all day long.

Fortunately, Pawoo kicks a giant gorilla\u2019s ass and throws it into the cannon, destroying it.\u00a0The rust factory falls apart, too. Milo gets out safely. And he breaks the news about Bisco to Pawoo and Jabi.The military gets to the scene to begin relief efforts and uh\u2026 evacuate the evil henchmen. I mean, I guess they were forced to be evil, so maybe they\u2019re not all bad.But it doesn\u2019t matter. A bunch get killed off anyways. To show off the rise of the Tetsujin that was inactive in the factory. Whaaat? But how did it come alive?!This thing is huge. It has the size and strength of an Eva unit. And it fires off some projectile that basically nukes the Weeping Child Ravine, where the Rust-Eater grows. That\u2019s not good.Tanks and other vehicles attack the Tetsujin but have no effect. Of course. It uses a rust breath on the vehicles that wipes them out instantly.Despite Pawoo\u2019s concerns, Milo dusts himself off, ready to fight Tetsujin all by himself. Tetsujin is walking towards Imihama.Elsewhere, Chiroru learns from government forces that Bisco has died. Kurokawa, too. She knows she has to try to help fight this monster somehow.\u00a0Tetsujin\u2019s next attack was about to hit those nomad people who wear space helmets, but Milo interrupts him.He starts doing what seems like his best impression of Bisco, to rile up Tetsujin. As Milo has figured out that Tetsujin is somehow controlled by Kurokawa\u2019s soul. Because that makes sense.\u00a0Milo actually does a really good job fighting Tetsujin by himself. His mushroom arrows are super effective against Tetsujin. Of course.Tetsujin tries to use the rust breath on Milo, but he\u2019s protected by that Rust-Eater immunity. Mostly.The nomad people fire a missile at Tetsujin, trying to help. Tetsujin fires at them, but luckily Actagawa and Jabi save them in the nick of time.Jabi and Milo then work together firing off tons of mushrooms, almost beating Tetsujin it seems.\u00a0Tetsujin\u2019s like, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m done playing games. And he shoots his nuke projectile straight in the air. It lands and decimates the cliff Jabi and Milo are on. They seems to fall to their deaths but of course they didn\u2019t.

Anime April 05, 09:51   0    #Attack_on_Titan #Review        Warning: Spoilers ahead.Following up right after the end of Attack on Titan Final Season Part 2 - Episode 10, Connie has just killed his former comrades, Samuel and Daz. Reiner and Annie as Armored Titan and Female Titan kill way more Yeagerists than that.Meanwhile, the Azumabito people explain to Hange and Magath that it will take a half a day to a day to get the airship flying. There\u2019s no way their team can hold off the Yeagerists that long, as titans can\u2019t stay transformed very long. And Yeagerist reinforcements might keep coming.By Hange\u2019s calculations, in half a day, the Rumbling will already be 600 kilometers inland. And in 4 days, the whole continent could be destroyed. For certain, Liberio would be destroyed. Kiyomi suggests going to an Azumabito hangar off the coast of Marley, reaching it before the Rumbling hits. And servicing the airship there. So they need to take a regular ship by water to get there, towing the airship with them. Hange agrees to this plan.Hange tells Mikasa, and Mikasa tells Annie. Floch\u2019s forces see the Azumabito on the run, and he knows they must be killed. But Mikasa and Hange kill his men.Female Titan and Armored Titan do their best to shield the Azumabito, but they get ripped to shreds by Thunder Spears in the process.Floch pumps up his men with a speech that they have to destroy the ship no matter what. To save Eren and their island. Falco sees Annie and Reiner getting overwhelmed. He wants to help by transforming into the Jaw Titan, but Cart Titan tells him not to. He runs off to do it anyways. Pieck will go after him once he gets her group to the ship safely.Just when you think it can\u2019t get any more difficult, Yeagerist back-up starts making its way to the dock by train. Hange and Mikasa worry about it for a second\u2026 before it gets blown to kingdom come by a mysterious force! Well, that was easy.Connie, Mikasa and Jean end up killing a bunch of Yeagerists in a very cool fluid action sequence. They feel terrible about it but they know they have no choice.The Yeagerists seem endless, and Pieck and the others are running out of steam. That\u2019s when Falco transforms! Into a very falcon-like Jaw Titan.Floch tries to take them all on, with his goal firing a Thunder Spear into the ship. Something they could have done a hundred times by now if the Yeagerists hadn\u2019t used them against their enemy, but whatever. Anyways, he\u2019s stopped cold by a sniper bullet from Gabi. He falls in the water and appears to die.Mikasa kicks some major ass.Falco goes crazy. Pieck holds him down while Magath cuts him out of the titan.And everyone gets away on the ship!Except for Magath. Who heroically stays behind to hold off the enemy from pursuing. And sabotages the last ship that could tail them.But he\u2019s not alone. Shadis appears. A total stranger to Magath, but now his comrade. He was the one in the window who saw them escaping in the wagons. And he was the one who blew up the train of Yeagerists.We see both old men have so much in common. Right before they blow themselves up.Later, Annie learns the terrible news that they won\u2019t be able to save Liberio (and her father) in time. She almost gives up, but Hange points out that Magath kept fighting even knowing it would be too late for his homeland. To save others.In truth though, Annie doesn\u2019t want to fight anymore. She doesn\u2019t want to kill anymore. Not even Eren.

At least this episode isn\u2019t filled with quite the same level of nonsensical BS. Wein meets with King Gruyere and Caldmellia. They bluff that that can take in all 30,000 refugees. But Wein says he doesn\u2019t want Mealtars to be so indebted. He wants to purchase the Levetian army\u2019s spare weapon and supplies so that Mealtars can fight back Manfred\u2019s and Bardloche\u2019s forces on their own.Creepy Caldmellia loves playing these mind games with Wein, and so plans to refuse Wein\u2019s proposal. But Gruyere accepts them, and says the decision is up to him as it\u2019s his army, not hers.So the Mealtars people get equipped and outfitted in arms, and begin marching towards the enemy. As predicted, Barloche and Manfred don\u2019t want to fight the Mealtars people as their citizens bring profit to the kingdom.Wein has Lowa set up a meeting with Barloche and Manfred. At the meeting, he uses his old trick - pinning the supposed assassination attempt of Demetrio\u2026 on Demetrio! Even if it was actually Manfred who was really behind the assassination attempt.If either Manfred or Bardloche don\u2019t agree to this, Demetrio\u2019s claim to the throne will actually benefit. And neither brother wants that. So they reluctantly agree.\u00a0In the end, Mealtars is now part of Lowa\u2019s faction and not any of the brothers.Then a new arc starts - Wein explains to Ninym how he\u2019s able to import goods from the eastern Earthwold Empire into Natra. Then have Marden sell the goods to western countries with the lie that they\u2019re made in Natra. This is because some western Levetian countries are against buying eastern goods.King Gruyere then requests Wein visit his kingdom of Soljest. Wein agrees to it and stops by to see Zenovia in Marden on the way. Zenovia\u2019s vassal suggests they use the visit to renegotiate terms with Natra, including proposing marriage between Zenovia and Wein!Zenovia and Wein meet, and she reports that the conservative Levetian kingdom of Delunio is against purchasing goods from Marden. Delunio\u2019s Prime Minister Sirgis is the antagonist here. Wein advises her to ignore Sirgis until the bastard takes more serious action.To Wein\u2019s surprise, Zenovia never asked him to marry her. She lies and says it\u2019s because he\u2019s physically not her type. But the truth is, she thinks he\u2019s too brilliant and great of a man to keep up with. Similar to the way Lowa feels.

A refugee camp lies right outside the capital Parnam. These refugees were luckier than others. Some bordering the demon lord\u2019s domain have to fight to protect the borders. Others have been exploited as cheap labor. Souma is looking for a better outcome for the refugees in his kingdom, Friedonia.He meets with the refugee camp chief, Jirukoma and his sister Komain. Not being really subtle with the look of disadvantaged, exploited people, the creator of this series decided to make the two look like Native Americans.Supposedly, Souma is there to \u201chelp\u201d Jirukoma come to a decision about something that has not yet been explained to the audience. Komain seems ready to lash out at Souma, but Jirukoma stops her.Souma points out he\u2019s been allowing the refugees to hunt and gather in their kingdom illegally. He knows Jirukoma and many others want to go back to their homeland but can\u2019t because the monsters are there. But they also can\u2019t continue to stay on Friedonia lands unregistered and uncommitted to Friedonia.To solve the problem, Souma suggests that the refugees move to Venetinova, the new gulf coast city he\u2019s building. He says the refugees will get jobs and housing there.Again, Komain is bitchy to Souma about the offer. But Jirukoma asks she be excused, as she\u2019s only standing up for the people who are set on returning to their homeland.Jirukoma wants to accept the offer for the camp, but also asks for more time to discuss it with those refugees who won\u2019t take the offer.Just then, Brad barges in and says he needs Hilde\u2019s help performing a C-section birth for a refugee mother.With their skills and Souma\u2019s group helping, they are able to deliver successfully. And the mother lives, too.It\u2019s a convenient moment to point out that new generations are starting to be born outside Jirukoma\u2019s homeland. And that it would be cruel to have the new generation live without a home country. Jirukoma understands this, so he\u2019s come to his decision.He will leave to return to their homeland with those who wish to return to their homeland. Despite the monsters. He\u2019ll work and wait for the time he can get his homeland back. And he will leave Komain in charge of the refugees who begin new lives as citizens in Venetinova.The new mother lets Souma name the baby. He names him Fuku.Then Liscia gets lovey-dovey and says she and Souma should start working on having a baby, too. And Souma gets embarrassed, of course. Carla is also embarrassed.Image source: Amazon                0  \u00a0 Comment in the forum     How a realist hero rebuilt the kingdom Related News    Rust-Eater Bisco - Episode 11 Review - Bisco is Back from the Dead  Anime April 11, 09:58   0    #RustEaterBisco #Review #Shonen    Warning: Spoilers ahead.

It\u2019s pretty anticlimactic, but the whole series seems to just be relaxed, wholesome fun, so I wasn\u2019t really expecting anything too surprising, anyways.It begins with Skargo, Mai-mai, and Kartatz having a meeting. Skargo foolishly wants to move to the area their mother is settling, but the others talk sense into him. Cayna wakes up in her new village with a brand new hangover. Shocking. Luka brings her water to feel better. Roxine starts scolding Roxilius for not preventing Cayna from drinking too much the night before. Then Lytt comes in, saying her mom Marelle has good news downstairs.The good news is that the villagers have decided to give Cayna the plot of land that the founders used to live on. The villagers feel they owe Cayna so much, so they\u2019re happy to gift it.Then Marelle and the villagers say they need yet another party again, to commemorate deciding where to build her home! Which means more drinking and more hangovers for Cayna. Oof.This time Roxine was assigned to watch over Cayna as she drinks. The next time, we find out Roxine also failed to stop Cayna from having too much.After this, Cayna summons an earth spirit and uses her OP player abilities to build a modern home instantly. Again, this isn\u2019t surprising after everything we\u2019ve seen Cayna do over the season.Cayna and Luka tour the house as Rox and Cie check for imperfections. Of which there are none. Luka is amazed at the sight of her new room. Rox and Cie bicker yet again, and this time even Luka scolds them.The villagers come to help with building the home, but find Cayna finished the job already. So instead, the villagers help with covering the house in flowers.At night, Cayna joins Mimily in the public bath. Mimily actually feels happy with her new home, and tells Cayna she doesn\u2019t need to look for her old home for now.The next day, Cayna gives lessons to Lytt and Luka. Then they play, making flower crowns while Cayna drinks tea. She reminisces about all the nice people she\u2019s met and adventures she\u2019s had after arriving in the land of Leadale.Then, Luka hands Cayna a flower crown. And finally calls her mother for the first time. It makes Cayna teary-eyed with joy.Finally, in the end of the ep, Cayna keeps her promise to give Lytt a flight. She summons griffins and they fly high above the land.

Their first stop is Shimobuki Base so Pawoo can meet up with her subordinates. Chiroru conveniently found a manual on operation Tetsujin at the base.Then we see Milo, Actagawa and Jabi. They survived their fall off the cliff. Of course, they did! They can\u2019t kill off Milo, too! There would be no main characters left!While Milo treats Jabi\u2019s wounded leg, the two theorize about what this Tetsujin is. With its Rust power, it seems to be a god of death. Since Rust Eater is the antithesis, the Rust Eater is like a death god eater.\u00a0Milo leaves Jabi to be taken care of by the nomad people while he goes after Tetsujin, who is headed for Imihama. Jabi tells him not to die. And even calls him Bisco, as he believe Bisco\u2019s soul passed on to Milo.Meanwhile, some nomads attack Tetsujin/Kurokawa with missiles but get wasted by its rust.Tetsujin keeps moving toward Imihama. Its next stop is Nuts\u2019 village, Calvero! The kids see it coming and realize it will likely mean the destruction of their village. They don\u2019t like but, but Kousuke points out that they have no choice but to evacuate.So all the kids run away from the village as fast as they can, but of course Tetsujin is huge and catches up to them quickly. Tetsujin sets off a blast trip left behind by the kids, and that pisses it off.Nuts decides to be a decoy to let the others escape. He even throws his harpoon at Tetsujin! Which of course has no effect.Right as Nuts is about to be blasted to death, an arrow comes out of nowhere and produces a protective mushroom around him and shields him.Milo shows his face to Tetsujin and starts talking like Bisco again. The kids can tell Milo is different than before.Milo engages in a mushroom arrow/blast fight with Tetsujin. Then Pawoo drops out of the air thanks to one of those slug planes. She whacks Tetsujin in the head. Chiroru and Jabi meet up with Milo in the red truck.The Imihama Watch take care of the kids, while the military again hits Tetsujin with ineffective firepower.Back at Imihama, the prostitutes and the Madam catch a video of Tetsujin on its way. Although who\u2019s recording this on camera is never explained. It\u2019s just convenient.Tetsujin gets tired of getting bombarded by multiple enemies and opens its chest cavity, releasing another powerful rust blast that kills off a bunch of planes and tanks. Milo\u2019s group barely survives the rust windstorm, thanks to Actagawa\u2019s protection.Despite Jabi\u2019s warnings, Milo injects himself with Bishamon poison to give him a strength boost. His body won\u2019t last long after taking it.The people of Imihama see Milo face down Tetsujin. Milo uses mushrooms to jump onto Tetsujin\u2019s back and starts cutting and stabbing away at the monster. He happens to find Bisco\u2019s goggles lodged in Tetsujin. Then, somehow, a fully healed (alive) Bisco claws its way out of Tetsujin! He\u2019s back! What?!

It\u2019s covered with a poisonous fog. Luckily, it has no effect on her.Cayna senses someone. It\u2019s not a zombie. It\u2019s a human player. The \u201cwoman\u201d from previous episodes at Helshper\u2019s guild.The woman takes Cayna to her partner, hiding in a basement. An unconscious little girl is also there.The \u201cwoman\u201d continues to try to sound like a woman but Cayna calls her out that it\u2019s not working. Exis, having pieced things together, realizes she is the famed Cayna of Cream Cheese.Exis used to be called Tartarus, but Cayna remembers his as Tartar Sauce, which makes her crack up. Tartarus also used to be in Cream Cheese, but he was a weak mage back then so Cayna didn\u2019t recognize him in Dragoid form now.The woman introduces herself as Quolkeh, someone who\u2019s a man in the real world.Exis and Quolkeh explain they\u2019re there for a quest. And Cayna explains she\u2019s looking for the Dragon King Palace. They also don\u2019t understand this zombie/fog mystery.

Is it filler? Guess you can argue it isn\u2019t.It begins with Jean thinking how wonderful his life would be if he just sided completely with the Yeagerists. All he has to do is ignore that Hange is knocking on his window, telling him to meet up outside.But he doesn\u2019t. He meets with her, and Mikasa is there, too. They debrief each other. Mikasa is on board with stopping Eren. But Jean plays devil\u2019s advocate, saying Eren\u2019s plan saves their people and home from being destroyed by the world. But Hange won\u2019t listen. She believes genocide is not an option. Also, she feels responsibility as Commander of the Survey Corps, to all who have fallen. Like Erwin.So Jean finally agrees. And that\u2019s how they were able to execute the rescue plan in the previous ep.Cut to the campfire, where you can cut the tension with a knife, just like the potato Hange throws in the stew.First to antagonize is Magath, calling them island demons. Jean and he spar verbally, about whose side acted immorally first. Magath goes as far back as 2000 years ago.Hange seems to calm them down. But Annie is the next to bring up a thorny subject. Will Mikasa, Armin, Connie, and Jean even be able to kill Eren?Mikasa says she wants to stop him without killing him. Which almost sparks a fight between Annie and Mikasa. But Annie accepts her answer and again, they calm down.Then the focus turns on Yelena. They try to antagonize her to get her to tell them where Eren is going. They believe she would know.Yelena fires back at most of them, reminding them of the horrible things they\u2019ve done. She\u2019s not the only monster here. And it\u2019s a good way to recap so much of what has happened in this long, complicated story that\u2019s spanned nearly 10 real life years.\u00a0Maybe Yelena says all this because she\u2019s given up and wants it all to burn. Wants everyone to rip each other\u2019s throats out. But Jean actually thanks her. By letting all this stuff out, it clears the air.One last bomb from Yelena - she brings up the subject of Marco who Annie helped kill. But Reiner reveals he gave the order. He tries to apologize.That\u2019s the last straw. Jean gets up and starts beating the shit out of Reiner. Then Gabi gets in the way and Jean accidentally kicks her hard in the gut. She bows down, Japanese style, and begs forgiveness for all they\u2019ve done. And begs for their help.The next day, Jean apologizes to Gabi, but not to Reiner. Reiner\u2019s fine with that.The Cart Titan scouts ahead and reports that Floch\u2019s Yeagerists have taken the port and Azumabito\u2019s people. Which they need.

All he has to do is ignore that Hange is knocking on his window, telling him to meet up outside.But he doesn\u2019t. He meets with her, and Mikasa is there, too. They debrief each other. Mikasa is on board with stopping Eren. But Jean plays devil\u2019s advocate, saying Eren\u2019s plan saves their people and home from being destroyed by the world. But Hange won\u2019t listen. She believes genocide is not an option. Also, she feels responsibility as Commander of the Survey Corps, to all who have fallen. Like Erwin.So Jean finally agrees. And that\u2019s how they were able to execute the rescue plan in the previous ep.Cut to the campfire, where you can cut the tension with a knife, just like the potato Hange throws in the stew.First to antagonize is Magath, calling them island demons. Jean and he spar verbally, about whose side acted immorally first. Magath goes as far back as 2000 years ago.Hange seems to calm them down. But Annie is the next to bring up a thorny subject. Will Mikasa, Armin, Connie, and Jean even be able to kill Eren?Mikasa says she wants to stop him without killing him. Which almost sparks a fight between Annie and Mikasa. But Annie accepts her answer and again, they calm down.Then the focus turns on Yelena. They try to antagonize her to get her to tell them where Eren is going. They believe she would know.Yelena fires back at most of them, reminding them of the horrible things they\u2019ve done. She\u2019s not the only monster here. And it\u2019s a good way to recap so much of what has happened in this long, complicated story that\u2019s spanned nearly 10 real life years.\u00a0Maybe Yelena says all this because she\u2019s given up and wants it all to burn. Wants everyone to rip each other\u2019s throats out. But Jean actually thanks her. By letting all this stuff out, it clears the air.One last bomb from Yelena - she brings up the subject of Marco who Annie helped kill. But Reiner reveals he gave the order. He tries to apologize.That\u2019s the last straw. Jean gets up and starts beating the shit out of Reiner. Then Gabi gets in the way and Jean accidentally kicks her hard in the gut. She bows down, Japanese style, and begs forgiveness for all they\u2019ve done. And begs for their help.The next day, Jean apologizes to Gabi, but not to Reiner. Reiner\u2019s fine with that.The Cart Titan scouts ahead and reports that Floch\u2019s Yeagerists have taken the port and Azumabito\u2019s people. Which they need.
