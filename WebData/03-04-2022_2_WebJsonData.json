By Diane Darcy Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Episode 12 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest, \"The Strongest Sage Goes on a Journey Again,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In Episode 1 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest, Gaius induced his reincarnation to obtain the four crests he desired. In the era of his original incarnation, the four crests were considered the most powerful in battle. 5,000 years later, Gaius is reborn with the four crests as a boy named Matthias \u201cMatty\u201d Hildesheimer, although in this timeline, the four crests is rejected as the weakest. As such, he was only able to enroll in the second-tier magic school known as the Second Academy in the kingdom of Eis.  Throughout the series, Matty reveals that he retained the memories of his past incarnation and uses his past life experiences in battles against demons. He also reveals through exposition the magical tools he invented in his past life that allow him to win fights against demons with little to no effort. During his stay at the Second Academy, Matty befriended his classmates Lurie and Alma, although he hasn't said anything about who he really is to them. Along the way, he was also reacquainted with his old friend Iris the darkness dragon -- the only one who knows his secret. RELATED: The Strongest Sage Meets His Equal as a Demon Slayer                  After stopping various demonic invasions throughout the series, Matty encountered a demonic presence he couldn't beat: the ancient demon Zardias who knew him as Gaius. Since that discovery, Matty set about locating the demon, which required the use of an ancient device he invented. Unfortunately for Matty, Zardias broke out of his magic prison the moment he determined his location and set course for the kingdom of Eis. With his resident kingdom in danger, Matty tasks Lurie and Alma with retrieving an ancient sword he invented in his former life while he battles Zardias alongside Iris. The fight against Zardias proves to be nothing like Matty's earlier battles. Zardias is a lot stronger and deadlier than the demons Matty previously defeated, and his strategies don't work on the ancient demon. On top of that, Zardias shows he has tricks of his own, one of which ends up wounding Matty. This forces Matty to realize he'll have to sacrifice his current incarnation to defeat the demon, or humanity is done for. Since letting humanity die is not an option for Matty, he contemplates using his remaining magic to kill the demon and perform another reincarnation spell to save himself. While reincarnation is Matty's only viable option in a deadly situation, there's one problem: if he reincarnates into another future timeline, Lurie and Alma will no longer be part of his life, as they will be long dead. Realizing he has grown fond of both girls and wants to remain with them along with Iris, Matty decides to hold off the demon a bit longer until Lurie arrives with the sword he needs. While Lurie does succeed at her task, Zardias delivers a fatal attack on Matty when he's not looking, successfully killing him. RELATED: The Strongest Sage: A Demonic Encounter Nearly Kills a Powerful Demon Slayer                  Seeing Matty brutally killed before her eyes proves too much for Lurie to handle. This feeling is only made worse by the fact she had given Matty the sword just seconds before Zardias impaled him with his own weapon. Before Lurie has the chance to grieve Matty's death, however, the sword in his possession activates and restores him to life. The sword also restores his magic, making him stronger and more powerful than before. This gives Matty the power boost he needs to destroy Zardias, which he does quickly without any consequence to himself. In the aftermath of the battle, everything in the kingdom of Eis returns to normal as if the threat of Zardias never happened. Even after his brief run-in with death, Matty doesn't seem fazed by the events that transpired. Lurie, however, is very shaken by the experience and admits her feelings for Matty by hugging him. While Matty doesn't use this opportunity to reciprocate her feelings, he does decide to do something nice for her to subtly let her know how much she means to him. While out shopping with the reward money he earned for defeating Zardias, Matty buys a blue stone that he reshapes into a pendant for a necklace. When he asks Lurie to meet him in private one night, Lurie thinks the intimate nature of their meeting is going to lead to them kissing. However, Matty only gives her the necklace he made for her. Although Lurie is grateful for Matty's gift, she doesn't take it as romantic confirmation of his feelings. Matty also doesn't use this opportunity to tell her the truth of who he really is or his past as Gaius as a way of progressing their relationship. This indicates that while Matty does love Lurie, he also doesn't trust her enough to tell her his secret. As such, The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest ends its first season on a rather anticlimactic note.

Josh Bell 2 days ago                      Morbius\u2019 Rushed & Muddled Story Won\u2019t Quench Audiences' Thirst  Morbius hits the ground running, but the Living Vampire movie is ultimately an uneven film that never quite figures out what it wants to be.  Sam Stone 2 days ago                      The Contractor Drops Chris Pine in a Generic Spy Thriller With Little Depth  The Contractor is a standard spy story that makes an effort to engage with deeper themes about the treatment of veterans but falls short.  Josh Bell 3 days ago                      Barbarians Compellingly Tackles Toxic Masculinity But Misses Its Landing  IFC Midnight's Barbarians examines toxic masculinity through the lens of a home invasion thriller that ultimately muddles its messaging.  Cass Clarke 3 days ago                      Night's End Flickers With Haunting Promise But Ultimately Fizzles Out  Night's End brings a lot of intriguing ideas to the surface around the strange powers of isolation but it ultimately doesn't stick its landing.  Cass Clarke 4 days ago                      Nitram Offers No Valuable Perspective On a Horrific, Real-Life Tragedy  Director Justin Kurzel's Nitram is somber and pointless. It neither honors victims of a real-life mass shooting nor asks for social change.

Samuel Gelman Mar 22, 2022                      Measure of Revenge\u2019s Muddled Ambitions Lead to a Middling Thriller  Measure of Revenge features some interesting moments and a strong female lead but gets muddled in too many genres and styles to truly land.  Jon Mendelsohn Mar 21, 2022                      REVIEW: Umma Teases a Provocative Story But Overuses Haunted House Tropes  Although Umma opens as a film that's easy to root for -- due to its complex story and unique imagery -- it relies too much on haunted house tropes.  Caitlin Chappell Mar 21, 2022                      Everything Everywhere All At Once Flaunts Michelle Yeoh's Unmatched Star Power  A24's Everything Everywhere All At Once is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, filled with fantastic action set-pieces and loads of heart.  Cass Clarke Mar 21, 2022                      Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood Charmingly Melds Nostalgia & Space Fantasy  Apollo 10 1/2: A Space Age Childhood is a quirky, delightful combination of a realistic \u201860s coming-of-age story with a boy\u2019s space fantasy.  Reuben Baron Mar 21, 2022                      The Lost City Elevates a Standard Plot With Humor & Chemistry  The Lost City's endearing characters, strong performances, and enthusiastic embrace of genre tropes elevate a by-the-numbers plot.  Brandon Zachary Mar 18, 2022                      Windfall Channels the Suspense & Wit of Vintage Thrillers  Full of dry, dark humor, Netflix's Windfall evokes vintage noir and suspense thrillers, with a slight modern strain of social commentary.  Josh Bell Mar 18, 2022                      REVIEW: Ti West's X Serves a Fun & Sensual Bloodbath With a Killer Message  From its opening scene, Ti West's X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.

E.L. Meszaros Mar 17, 2022                      Deep Water Surfaces as a Half-Hearted & Murky Erotic Thriller  Deep Water treads along with little to no suspense -- minus its ending -- and centers on a couple with murky character development.  Josh Bell Mar 16, 2022                      I Am What I Am Elevates Its Standard Story with Next-Level Animation  Narratively, I Am What I Am is a standard underdog sports movie, but its hyper-realistic animation makes the film worth watching.  Reuben Baron Mar 14, 2022                      Jujutsu Kaisen 0 Delivers a Thrilling & Emotional Prequel That Fans Will Love  Jujutsu Kaisen 0 is an exhilarating, visually stunning and faithful adaptation of the manga's prequel volume that is sure to make fans happy.

Jon Mendelsohn Mar 10, 2022                      The Adam Project Elevates Traditional Sci-Fi With Its Emotional Heart  The smaller character-based moments of The Adam Project make the film stand out and elevate the otherwise fine but disposable sci-fi/action film.

Here's a preview for the highly-anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie.     By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 anime season\u00a0will be filled with a colorful variety of new and returning series, from Season 2 of the\u00a0isekai adventure The Rising of the Shield Hero\u00a0to the return of\u00a0the beloved Netflix hit Komi Can't Communicate. But Komi has some fresh new competition this season, including the highly anticipated\u00a0Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This brand new series features a small but lovable cast of main characters, most of whom are high school students living their ordinary lives. The charming heroine Shikimori, however, is anything but an ordinary student. She promises to be a shojo-style shonen heroine unlike any other when the\u00a0story\u00a0begins airing on Crunchyroll\u00a0in April. Here's a brief preview of what to expect.  RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 The Premise Of Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie                  Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a fresh new slice-of-life romance/comedy anime, in a similar vein\u00a0to popular series such as Komi Can't Communicate and the beloved\u00a0Horimiya. Although Shikimori\u00a0isn't about to redefine the possibilities of high school\u00a0or slice-of-life anime, the series should appeal to any fan who can't get enough of the genre while also looking for assertive, strong female leads who can carry an entire series on their own. More and more anime today are giving girls a chance to shine as the protagonist in a variety of genres, from Komi Shoko to Love of Kill's\u00a0seinen-style shojo heroine Chateau Dankworth.\u00a0It's a trend that is absolutely worth continuing in the spring season with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This anime stars the shonen heroine Shikimori, a lively pink-haired student who is definitely the more assertive and dynamic member of her relationship with the meek but kind Izumi. During their idyllic high school days together, Shikimori will take the lead as the attention-grabbing star who can do it all, from competitive sports in gym class to being an everyday hero who can rescue her boyfriend from harm when things go wrong -- and she's an ace student to boot. Shikimori\u00a0is also known for giving off harsh glares that can make anyone back off and not want to mess with her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Izumi mainly just follows\u00a0her lead, but over time he may grow more assertive as well and make something of himself. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Spy x Family Headline Crunchyroll's Spring 2022 Season Where To Watch or Read Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie                  Anyone who is excited to dive into the story of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie doesn't have long to wait. The anime is due to begin airing in Japan on April 10, 2022, and will be available to stream on the Crunchyroll platform in the West. Meanwhile, interested fans can also try out the\u00a0still-ongoing\u00a0Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie manga, written and drawn by Keigo Maki. The\u00a0series has amassed 11 volumes so far, and paperback copies can be found through\u00a0Barnes & Noble's online catalog,\u00a0Right Stuf Anime's website\u00a0and Amazon's online catalog in the books department. As of this writing, the first eight volumes are available in English with Volume 9 releasing on April 5. Those who prefer digital manga can also find Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie on Amazon with the Kindle version, or through Barnes and Noble's catalog with the Nook version.

Here's a preview for the highly-anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie.     By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 anime season\u00a0will be filled with a colorful variety of new and returning series, from Season 2 of the\u00a0isekai adventure The Rising of the Shield Hero\u00a0to the return of\u00a0the beloved Netflix hit Komi Can't Communicate. But Komi has some fresh new competition this season, including the highly anticipated\u00a0Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This brand new series features a small but lovable cast of main characters, most of whom are high school students living their ordinary lives. The charming heroine Shikimori, however, is anything but an ordinary student. She promises to be a shojo-style shonen heroine unlike any other when the\u00a0story\u00a0begins airing on Crunchyroll\u00a0in April. Here's a brief preview of what to expect.  RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 The Premise Of Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie                  Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a fresh new slice-of-life romance/comedy anime, in a similar vein\u00a0to popular series such as Komi Can't Communicate and the beloved\u00a0Horimiya. Although Shikimori\u00a0isn't about to redefine the possibilities of high school\u00a0or slice-of-life anime, the series should appeal to any fan who can't get enough of the genre while also looking for assertive, strong female leads who can carry an entire series on their own. More and more anime today are giving girls a chance to shine as the protagonist in a variety of genres, from Komi Shoko to Love of Kill's\u00a0seinen-style shojo heroine Chateau Dankworth.\u00a0It's a trend that is absolutely worth continuing in the spring season with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This anime stars the shonen heroine Shikimori, a lively pink-haired student who is definitely the more assertive and dynamic member of her relationship with the meek but kind Izumi. During their idyllic high school days together, Shikimori will take the lead as the attention-grabbing star who can do it all, from competitive sports in gym class to being an everyday hero who can rescue her boyfriend from harm when things go wrong -- and she's an ace student to boot. Shikimori\u00a0is also known for giving off harsh glares that can make anyone back off and not want to mess with her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Izumi mainly just follows\u00a0her lead, but over time he may grow more assertive as well and make something of himself. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Spy x Family Headline Crunchyroll's Spring 2022 Season Where To Watch or Read Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie                  Anyone who is excited to dive into the story of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie doesn't have long to wait. The anime is due to begin airing in Japan on April 10, 2022, and will be available to stream on the Crunchyroll platform in the West. Meanwhile, interested fans can also try out the\u00a0still-ongoing\u00a0Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie manga, written and drawn by Keigo Maki. The\u00a0series has amassed 11 volumes so far, and paperback copies can be found through\u00a0Barnes & Noble's online catalog,\u00a0Right Stuf Anime's website\u00a0and Amazon's online catalog in the books department. As of this writing, the first eight volumes are available in English with Volume 9 releasing on April 5. Those who prefer digital manga can also find Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie on Amazon with the Kindle version, or through Barnes and Noble's catalog with the Nook version.

RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Beach Episode is Packed With Meaning Naofumi's Productive Adventure To Cal Mira's Beach In Shield Hero                   Late in Shield Hero's first season, the hero Iwatani Naofumi got his name cleared at last in the Melromarc royal court.\u00a0This meant he got invited along for an XP-grinding vacation to the pleasant Cal Mira archipelago with the other Cardinal Heroes and their allies. Naofumi was overdue for a change of scenery by now, and Shield Hero smartly blended the well-worn \"beach episode\" concept with a bonus adventure filled with action, adventure, and even a few new characters, namely L'Arc and his ally Therese. The Cal Mira archipelago had a pleasant Pacific vibe, complete with a tourist-friendly coastal town and sunny beaches, and Naofumi's party made the most of it. During this story sequence, Shield Hero allowed Naofumi to catch up to the other three heroes and share what he knew with them. It gave the beach sequence a sense of purpose and progress. Best of all, there was a plot twist in store for the heroes. Not long after Naofumi, Filo and the tanuki-girl Raphtalia arrived at the beach in their swimwear, Filo mentioned an underwater temple, so the group dove under the waves to check it out. Inside the abandoned temple, Naofumi discovered another dragon hourglass counting down to the next Wave, with barely 48 hours remaining until the next wave. This led to an exciting battle scene on the open sea near the archipelago, with the Cardinal Heroes, the queen, and a few galleons battling the aquatic Wave to conclude the season on a high note. All this gave Shield Hero's beach sequence a great deal of relevance to the plot, rather than feeling like an obligatory detour, and that makes all the difference. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept How Other Anime Series Handle Their Beach Episodes                  It's a running joke in the anime community that every anime series, no matter its tone or genre, has a token beach episode, and that's not far from the truth. Many slice-of-life series taking place in Japan, have a beach episode, such as Don't Toy With Me, Ms. Nagatoro!.\u00a0They also appear in more action-oriented series such as\u00a0My Hero Academia or even DARLING in the FRANXX, both of which have their own beach episodes, not to mention countless rom-com anime series. The question isn't whether a certain genre has the right context for a beach episode -- the question is whether the episode contributes to the plot and feels like an organic part of the story, rather than an obligatory side quest. That can give Shield Hero's own beach episode some context. An example of beach episodes done wrong is the token beach sequence in My Hero Academia season 5, featuring Ochaco, Tsuyu, Nejire, and Sirius filling an uneventful afternoon at the beach just because they could, and the entire scene was widely recognized as the filler that it was. In fact, the entire episode was filler, but at least some of it served as an on-ramp to the World Heroes' Mission movie, while the beach\u00a0sequence stuck out for being totally unnecessary. Slice-of-life and rom-com anime series make moderate use of beach episodes, such as My Senpai is Annoying and Nisekoi, advancing character relationships and personal arcs by token amounts at a sunny beach. The character progression could have happened in any setting, but at the beach, characters may feel relaxed and uninhibited, which can help them open up and move the plot along. Still, some series might go too far out of their way to visit the beach just because they can. In that context, Shield Hero's own beach scene stands out as one of anime's best in recent years, since it spent little to no time on gratuitous fan service or beach cliches such as burying someone up to their neck or playing beach volleyball. Instead, Shield Hero's beach sequence e soon became a fresh and exciting battlefield for the next Wave, and the good times lasted just long enough to give Naofumi a much-needed break before diving back into the action. More anime series could stand to follow this example.

Naofumi was overdue for a change of scenery by now, and Shield Hero smartly blended the well-worn \"beach episode\" concept with a bonus adventure filled with action, adventure, and even a few new characters, namely L'Arc and his ally Therese.

During this story sequence, Shield Hero allowed Naofumi to catch up to the other three heroes and share what he knew with them. It gave the beach sequence a sense of purpose and progress. Best of all, there was a plot twist in store for the heroes. Not long after Naofumi, Filo and the tanuki-girl Raphtalia arrived at the beach in their swimwear, Filo mentioned an underwater temple, so the group dove under the waves to check it out. Inside the abandoned temple, Naofumi discovered another dragon hourglass counting down to the next Wave, with barely 48 hours remaining until the next wave. This led to an exciting battle scene on the open sea near the archipelago, with the Cardinal Heroes, the queen, and a few galleons battling the aquatic Wave to conclude the season on a high note. All this gave Shield Hero's beach sequence a great deal of relevance to the plot, rather than feeling like an obligatory detour, and that makes all the difference. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept How Other Anime Series Handle Their Beach Episodes                  It's a running joke in the anime community that every anime series, no matter its tone or genre, has a token beach episode, and that's not far from the truth.

Slice-of-life and rom-com anime series make moderate use of beach episodes, such as My Senpai is Annoying and Nisekoi, advancing character relationships and personal arcs by token amounts at a sunny beach. The character progression could have happened in any setting, but at the beach, characters may feel relaxed and uninhibited, which can help them open up and move the plot along. Still, some series might go too far out of their way to visit the beach just because they can. In that context, Shield Hero's own beach scene stands out as one of anime's best in recent years, since it spent little to no time on gratuitous fan service or beach cliches such as burying someone up to their neck or playing beach volleyball. Instead, Shield Hero's beach sequence e soon became a fresh and exciting battlefield for the next Wave, and the good times lasted just long enough to give Naofumi a much-needed break before diving back into the action. More anime series could stand to follow this example.

What Will Yangchen's Novel Reveal About The Avatar Before Her? The Dawn of Yangchen novel will follow the Avatar's rise to becoming a legend, but she needs to do that in Avatar Szeto's shadow.     By Brenton Stewart Published 3 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Avatar: The Last Airbender depicted Aang's struggles saving the world from the challenges the previous Avatars created, and ever since then, it has been a theme in the franchise to show how every Avatar responds to the legacy of their predecessors. In the prequel novels\u00a0The Rise of Kyoshi and\u00a0The Shadow of Kyoshi, this proved truer than ever, as Kyoshi not only had to deal with the problems of Kuruk's time but also meet the legendary standard that Yangchen set before her. In\u00a0The Dawn of Yangchen, the cycle will continue as the prequel novel explores Yangchen's own challenges in living up to her predecessor, Avatar Szeto. But just what do we know about Szeto's legacy, and what might that mean for Yangchen's journey?  RELATED:\u00a0Avatar Roku's Waterbending Master May Be the Greatest Waterbender of All Time                  Much of Yangchen's life is largely a mystery in the\u00a0Avatar franchise, as she was seldom seen in the original series. Luckily, the novels and comics provide more detail about her life, fleshing out Yangchen as a legendary figure who navigated international tensions with such diplomacy that she kept the world safe from war even past her own lifetime. The comic\u00a0The Rift even delves into a conflict she had with the spirit General Old Iron shortly after she mastered the four elements. However, judging by\u00a0The Dawn of Yangchen's synopsis, much of the story will take place around or even before the earlier days of her career. The synopsis for the novel emphasizes Yangchen's inexperience during its setting and her growth into her role as Avatar in stark contrast to her predecessor Szeto. It sets up a story in which Yangchen's struggles with Earth Kingdom politics and the threat of a weapon of mass destruction threaten the stability of the world, but from what we know of Szeto's time, such political machinations were the Fire Avatar's forte. RELATED:\u00a0Stunning Avatar Fan Art Spotlights Aang's Cutest Companion The Shadow of Kyoshi established that Szeto was a wise and tactical Avatar whose primary accomplishments resulted from his mastery of bureaucracy as much as the four elements. Rising through the ranks of the Fire Nation's political infrastructure, Szeto became the Grand Advisor to Fire Lord Ysor. With a shrewd sense of accounting and diplomacy, he managed to unify the Fire Nation government during a time of great strife and hardship from natural disasters, making him a revered figure even generations after his death. However, what's most notable about what we know of Szeto's life is how little of it seemed to hold influence over the rest of the world. Although Szeto is widely celebrated in the Fire Nation, there is little to nothing in the canon about his influence on the political stability in the other Four Nations. While he was undoubtedly a powerful bender, seen in a flashback erupting multiple volcanos while in the Avatar State, it seems that what Yangchen may have to deal with primarily are his failings to balance the rest of the world while tending to his own nation. RELATED:\u00a0Avatar Legends: What Was Wan Shi Tong's Library Like Before Aang?                  Indeed, the Earth Kingdom proved to be rife with corruption and conflict by the Era of Kyoshi two cycles later, and the problems there were so deeply entrenched that they remained even in the days of following Avatars like Roku, Aang and Korra. This could mean that the inexperienced Yangchen is in over her head where the Earth Kingdom's crown is concerned. Given that the Air Nomad survives the conflicts of her time and manages to succeed where Szeto failed, this stands out as one of the most intriguing elements of the upcoming novel that fans should anticipate. Indeed, Yangchen's own failings were already explored in the prior\u00a0Kyoshi novels. Every good story needs a good conflict, after all, and it appears that Yangchen will have no shortage of those in the days before she became the myth that would last for generations.

By Louis Kemner Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com anime series that is due to return in the Spring 2022 anime season, and anime fans stand to learn a lot from this charming edutainment anime series. Similar to Dr. Stone and Cells at Work!, this anime can entertain viewers with charming characters and skits while also teaching them real-life science. Protagonists Yukimura Shinya and Himuro Ayame both use real-life science to explain their experiments in the world of love, and they are happy to explain the inner workings of their theories and methods during an episode. To back them up, there's also the bonus character Rikekuma the science bear, a talking teddy bear who goes in-depth on a variety of topics in between scenes.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya The Role Of Rikekuma The Science Bear                  Rikekuma the science bear isn't a proper character in the series -- that is, Rikekuma never interacts with anyone else in the main cast of Science Fell in Love, and none of the main characters even acknowledge or seem to be aware of Rikekuma at all. Instead, this talking teddy bear is more like a mascot for the series who appears in between scenes to deliver lectures that would interrupt the pacing of an actual scene in Science Fell in Love. Rikekuma's main job is to deliver concise, detailed lectures on topics such as margins of error and the \"traveling salesman\" problem when the main characters cannot, and give Science Fell in Love fans more context for what Ayame and Shinya are talking about. Rikekuma, however, doesn't seem too thrilled with any of this. Amusingly, this bonus character usually seems to be in a bad mood, and Rikekuma seems to scorn humans for their sloppy and careless ways. Rikekuma usually delivers its lectures with an air of impatience and reluctance, which creates contrast with the charming and easygoing main characters, who are more interested in doki-doki heart rates and kissing than lecturing anyone. Rikekuma is a foil to the lovestruck Ayame and her kuudere lab partner Shinya, which helps provide balance in the series and keep it more grounded with a new perspective. Ayame often has her head in the clouds, so the grouchy Rikekuma is there to keep the anime's tone in check, and deliver some hard science all the while. Oddly, Rikekuma has an adorable appearance as a talking teddy bear in glasses, and it might even dress up during its lectures, unaware of how much it can charm viewers despite its attitude. There's no character quite like Rikekuma the science bear. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right Rikekuma's Best Science Lectures In The Anime                  Rikekuma the science bear appears in several episodes of Science Fell in Love\u00a0and expanded upon a variety of intriguing topics without sounding too dry about it. One of Rikekuma's most memorable lectures involves the \"traveling salesman\" problem, a scenario describing how a single party can visit a set number of cities once each while traveling the shortest possible distance before returning to the original city. This scenario is a matter of optimizing a vast set of data where many combinations or routes for a solution may exist. In some cases, it may be hopelessly difficult to find the truly optimal route, so a scientist or researcher may have to make do with a moderately efficient route, and sacrifice the possibility of the \"perfect\" route. In many fields of research, only the most accurate, efficient, and relevant data is desired, but even scientists have their limits, and in some scenarios, finding the \"perfect\" route simply won't happen. In Science Fell in Love, for example, Shinya and Ayame went on a date and intended to visit every attraction at the amusement park in the most efficient manner to keep their schedule, but that's easier said than done. Rikekuma also delivered a lecture about the benefits of rounding, since many numbers in a scientific experiment or math problem are irrational numbers, with a patternless series of numbers stretching infinitely, such as 7.5827908264023148... and so on. Not even the most detail-oriented scientist would attempt a calculation with numbers like that, so scientists tend to round to a certain decimal place, such as the thousandths place. The irrational number given earlier, for example, could be rounded to 7.583, since the \"7\" after the \"2\" causes the 2 to become a 3, as the numbers 5-9 cause the previous one to go up. Then, during the amusement park sequence in Science Fell in Love Episode 4, Rikekuma explained now \"normalization\" works when working with data. In that episode, Shinya and Ayame wanted to calculate which new pair of shoes was the optimal one to buy, with price being just one of several factors, along with fashion sense, functionality, and base preference. These factors and more can be measured in different ways or not at all, so it's important for the researcher to treat each factor the same way so they can be calculated together -- in this case, every factor for the shoes was given a value out of 100. Otherwise, the calculations would be a case of \"apples to oranges.\" KEEP READING: The Angels Beats Ending, Explained      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                   Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family?

By Louis Kemner Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com anime series that is due to return in the Spring 2022 anime season, and anime fans stand to learn a lot from this charming edutainment anime series. Similar to Dr. Stone and Cells at Work!, this anime can entertain viewers with charming characters and skits while also teaching them real-life science. Protagonists Yukimura Shinya and Himuro Ayame both use real-life science to explain their experiments in the world of love, and they are happy to explain the inner workings of their theories and methods during an episode. To back them up, there's also the bonus character Rikekuma the science bear, a talking teddy bear who goes in-depth on a variety of topics in between scenes.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya The Role Of Rikekuma The Science Bear                  Rikekuma the science bear isn't a proper character in the series -- that is, Rikekuma never interacts with anyone else in the main cast of Science Fell in Love, and none of the main characters even acknowledge or seem to be aware of Rikekuma at all. Instead, this talking teddy bear is more like a mascot for the series who appears in between scenes to deliver lectures that would interrupt the pacing of an actual scene in Science Fell in Love. Rikekuma's main job is to deliver concise, detailed lectures on topics such as margins of error and the \"traveling salesman\" problem when the main characters cannot, and give Science Fell in Love fans more context for what Ayame and Shinya are talking about. Rikekuma, however, doesn't seem too thrilled with any of this. Amusingly, this bonus character usually seems to be in a bad mood, and Rikekuma seems to scorn humans for their sloppy and careless ways. Rikekuma usually delivers its lectures with an air of impatience and reluctance, which creates contrast with the charming and easygoing main characters, who are more interested in doki-doki heart rates and kissing than lecturing anyone. Rikekuma is a foil to the lovestruck Ayame and her kuudere lab partner Shinya, which helps provide balance in the series and keep it more grounded with a new perspective. Ayame often has her head in the clouds, so the grouchy Rikekuma is there to keep the anime's tone in check, and deliver some hard science all the while. Oddly, Rikekuma has an adorable appearance as a talking teddy bear in glasses, and it might even dress up during its lectures, unaware of how much it can charm viewers despite its attitude. There's no character quite like Rikekuma the science bear. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right Rikekuma's Best Science Lectures In The Anime                  Rikekuma the science bear appears in several episodes of Science Fell in Love\u00a0and expanded upon a variety of intriguing topics without sounding too dry about it. One of Rikekuma's most memorable lectures involves the \"traveling salesman\" problem, a scenario describing how a single party can visit a set number of cities once each while traveling the shortest possible distance before returning to the original city. This scenario is a matter of optimizing a vast set of data where many combinations or routes for a solution may exist. In some cases, it may be hopelessly difficult to find the truly optimal route, so a scientist or researcher may have to make do with a moderately efficient route, and sacrifice the possibility of the \"perfect\" route. In many fields of research, only the most accurate, efficient, and relevant data is desired, but even scientists have their limits, and in some scenarios, finding the \"perfect\" route simply won't happen. In Science Fell in Love, for example, Shinya and Ayame went on a date and intended to visit every attraction at the amusement park in the most efficient manner to keep their schedule, but that's easier said than done. Rikekuma also delivered a lecture about the benefits of rounding, since many numbers in a scientific experiment or math problem are irrational numbers, with a patternless series of numbers stretching infinitely, such as 7.5827908264023148... and so on. Not even the most detail-oriented scientist would attempt a calculation with numbers like that, so scientists tend to round to a certain decimal place, such as the thousandths place. The irrational number given earlier, for example, could be rounded to 7.583, since the \"7\" after the \"2\" causes the 2 to become a 3, as the numbers 5-9 cause the previous one to go up. Then, during the amusement park sequence in Science Fell in Love Episode 4, Rikekuma explained now \"normalization\" works when working with data. In that episode, Shinya and Ayame wanted to calculate which new pair of shoes was the optimal one to buy, with price being just one of several factors, along with fashion sense, functionality, and base preference. These factors and more can be measured in different ways or not at all, so it's important for the researcher to treat each factor the same way so they can be calculated together -- in this case, every factor for the shoes was given a value out of 100. Otherwise, the calculations would be a case of \"apples to oranges.\" KEEP READING: The Angels Beats Ending, Explained      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                   Demon Slayer: Why Did Muzan Kill Tanjiro's Family?

By Jonathon Greenall Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Hatsune Miku is an icon. First launched in 2007, the anthropomorphic representation of the popular Vocaloid voicebank has become a massive and recognized star worldwide. The character has since appeared in countless video games, anime series and other media. It was also recently confirmed that Miku\u00a0will appear in a special crossover series called Dropkick on My Devil! X Mame Anime, which will promote the island of Hokkaido. However, this isn't Hatsune Miku's first anime appearance -- nor is it the weirdest. In 2018, Hatsune Miku appeared in an anime called\u00a0Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion. This train-based mecha series, created by Takara Tomy and Japan Railways Group, follows a young boy who loves trains named Hayato Hayasugi. One day, Hayato learns his father is secretly working for the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute, a secretive organization that creates Shinkalions to fight monsters that try to attack Japan.\u00a0The boy turns out to have an aptitude for piloting Shinkalions and becomes the pilot of the Shinkalion E5 Hayabusa.  Related: Gundam's Iron-Blooded Orphans Spinoff Trailer Introduces a Slew of New Characters and Mecha                  Miku appears in the anime's 15th episode, \"Go North!! Shinkalion H5 Hayabusa.\" Hayato and his friends realize their mysterious foe is planning to spread panic by revealing monsters to the world, and they're soon proved\u00a0right when one attacks Hakodate in Hokkaido. The pilots dive into their Shinkalions and head there to fight, but realize they're not going to make it in time. However, before the plan can come to fruition, another Shinkalion enters the fray. Hayato and his friends are initially confused when they learn the pilot is a girl with distinctive blue twin tails and a robotic voice. This girl holds the monster off, eventually destroying it with her robot's finishing move. After the battle, she introduces herself as Hatsune Miku. However, this Miku differs a little from\u00a0her usual forms found in other media.\u00a0Here,\u00a0she is an eleven-year-old girl who wants to become a Shinkalion driver but is held back by motion sickness. When Hayato falls ill, Miku once again\u00a0must dive into battle in her Shinkalion, proving herself as a pilot.

By Jonathon Greenall Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Hatsune Miku is an icon. First launched in 2007, the anthropomorphic representation of the popular Vocaloid voicebank has become a massive and recognized star worldwide. The character has since appeared in countless video games, anime series and other media. It was also recently confirmed that Miku\u00a0will appear in a special crossover series called Dropkick on My Devil! X Mame Anime, which will promote the island of Hokkaido. However, this isn't Hatsune Miku's first anime appearance -- nor is it the weirdest. In 2018, Hatsune Miku appeared in an anime called\u00a0Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion. This train-based mecha series, created by Takara Tomy and Japan Railways Group, follows a young boy who loves trains named Hayato Hayasugi. One day, Hayato learns his father is secretly working for the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute, a secretive organization that creates Shinkalions to fight monsters that try to attack Japan.\u00a0The boy turns out to have an aptitude for piloting Shinkalions and becomes the pilot of the Shinkalion E5 Hayabusa.

Shinkalion H5 Hayabusa.\" Hayato and his friends realize their mysterious foe is planning to spread panic by revealing monsters to the world, and they're soon proved\u00a0right when one attacks Hakodate in Hokkaido. The pilots dive into their Shinkalions and head there to fight, but realize they're not going to make it in time. However, before the plan can come to fruition, another Shinkalion enters the fray. Hayato and his friends are initially confused when they learn the pilot is a girl with distinctive blue twin tails and a robotic voice. This girl holds the monster off, eventually destroying it with her robot's finishing move. After the battle, she introduces herself as Hatsune Miku. However, this Miku differs a little from\u00a0her usual forms found in other media.\u00a0Here,\u00a0she is an eleven-year-old girl who wants to become a Shinkalion driver but is held back by motion sickness. When Hayato falls ill, Miku once again\u00a0must dive into battle in her Shinkalion, proving herself as a pilot. Shinkalion's\u00a0Miku lore is full of references to the original Vocaloid.\u00a0The character is voiced by Saki Fujita, the actress whose voice is the basis for the\u00a0singer's voicebank. Her age of 11 references the fact that the Miku voicebank was 11 years old at the time of the episode's release. Her being based at the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute's Hokkaido Branch references the headquarters of Crypton Future Media -- the company behind the Miku voicebank.

By Louis Kemner Published 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Love of Kill Episode 12, \"My Name,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In previous episodes of Love of Kill, the haunted heroine Chateau Dankworth recalled her violent past with the original Ryang-Ha Song and his mysterious imposter, and flashbacks finally shed some light on how she and the two of them are connected. Now in the Season 1 finale, Chateau must do something about the strained emotions inside her. Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha are currently hiding from the vicious Mr. Donny and his young assassins, but\u00a0she's\u00a0not in the clear just yet. She cannot bear the guilt of having shot the original Ryang-Ha in a moment of panic but the new\u00a0one is here to help, and the two unlikely allies may find a way to move on from the past and face the future together.  RELATED: Platinum End: Was it Muni Who Plotted to [SPOILER] Heaven?                  Ryang-Ha brings Chateau to one of his safe houses in the attic of a small apartment. There she awakens from many hours of sleep, with her troubled past still on her mind. She admits to remembering everything about the fateful night when she shot the original Ryang-Ha by accident, and admits these memories are why she cannot push her yandere-style lover away in the present day.\u00a0Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha have a strong connection thanks to the original's sacrifice, and Episode 12 makes it clear that this bond is more wholesome than Ryang-Ha's earlier antics might have suggested. Earlier in Love of Kill, the current Ryang-Ha was an obnoxious yandere who pestered Chateau nonstop as her self-appointed guardian. She simply couldn't get rid of this pest, even aboard the Artemisia cruise ship. At the time, it wasn't clear if Ryang-Ha was acting out of genuine affection\u00a0or jealous self-interest, and his mysterious background didn't help. Now, recent episodes assure viewers that Ryang-Ha always truly had Chateau's best interests at heart. The guardian\u00a0feels responsible for Chateau after the original Ryang-Ha Song's death, and protecting\u00a0her after all these years is his way of paying tribute to the original's memory. In the present day, Chateau understands and accepts this, and once she processes her guilt, she and Ryang-Ha get ready for the next step. RELATED: The Strongest Sage's Final Episode Leaves a Lot to be Desired                  Once Chateau finishes\u00a0working through\u00a0her difficult emotions, she settles down and helps Ryang-Ha clean up the dusty safe house -- and requests to formally hire\u00a0him as her agent. He refuses to be paid any money, however, and specifies that he wants something\u00a0different from her. Chateau is stumped, but he's most likely asking for\u00a0her genuine affection, possibly as his girlfriend. Ryang-Ha has been an obnoxious but well-meaning Mr. Romance since the start\u00a0in Love of Kill, and with everything quiet again,\u00a0he has the chance to express that side of him once more. He's enamored with Chateau, allowing the shojo side of this seinen-style thriller series to shine forth. The two of them may actually become a couple in a possible Season 2, or at least take the first steps in that direction. There's no longer anyone or anything to get in the way. As Season 1 concludes, Chateau and Ryang-Ha are on the roof when a helicopter arrives and they whip out their pistols, ready for action. By now, they both have a deeper and more respectful understanding of one another and their relationship. Chateau accepts Ryang-Ha as her lovestruck bodyguard\u00a0while he\u00a0acknowledges her as his true equal and partner, and not just someone who needs protection. Despite being the shojo heroine since the start, Chateau relied heavily on Ryang-Ha and other characters for survival and purpose. Now she has truly blossomed, and Ryang-Ha is clearly happy for her. They can face the future and its dangers side by side as co-stars of the winter anime season's bloodiest shojo adventure.

By Louis Kemner Published 8 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Love of Kill Episode 12, \"My Name,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In previous episodes of Love of Kill, the haunted heroine Chateau Dankworth recalled her violent past with the original Ryang-Ha Song and his mysterious imposter, and flashbacks finally shed some light on how she and the two of them are connected. Now in the Season 1 finale, Chateau must do something about the strained emotions inside her. Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha are currently hiding from the vicious Mr. Donny and his young assassins, but\u00a0she's\u00a0not in the clear just yet. She cannot bear the guilt of having shot the original Ryang-Ha in a moment of panic but the new\u00a0one is here to help, and the two unlikely allies may find a way to move on from the past and face the future together.  RELATED: Platinum End: Was it Muni Who Plotted to [SPOILER] Heaven?                  Ryang-Ha brings Chateau to one of his safe houses in the attic of a small apartment. There she awakens from many hours of sleep, with her troubled past still on her mind. She admits to remembering everything about the fateful night when she shot the original Ryang-Ha by accident, and admits these memories are why she cannot push her yandere-style lover away in the present day.\u00a0Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha have a strong connection thanks to the original's sacrifice, and Episode 12 makes it clear that this bond is more wholesome than Ryang-Ha's earlier antics might have suggested. Earlier in Love of Kill, the current Ryang-Ha was an obnoxious yandere who pestered Chateau nonstop as her self-appointed guardian. She simply couldn't get rid of this pest, even aboard the Artemisia cruise ship. At the time, it wasn't clear if Ryang-Ha was acting out of genuine affection\u00a0or jealous self-interest, and his mysterious background didn't help. Now, recent episodes assure viewers that Ryang-Ha always truly had Chateau's best interests at heart. The guardian\u00a0feels responsible for Chateau after the original Ryang-Ha Song's death, and protecting\u00a0her after all these years is his way of paying tribute to the original's memory. In the present day, Chateau understands and accepts this, and once she processes her guilt, she and Ryang-Ha get ready for the next step. RELATED: The Strongest Sage's Final Episode Leaves a Lot to be Desired                  Once Chateau finishes\u00a0working through\u00a0her difficult emotions, she settles down and helps Ryang-Ha clean up the dusty safe house -- and requests to formally hire\u00a0him as her agent. He refuses to be paid any money, however, and specifies that he wants something\u00a0different from her. Chateau is stumped, but he's most likely asking for\u00a0her genuine affection, possibly as his girlfriend. Ryang-Ha has been an obnoxious but well-meaning Mr. Romance since the start\u00a0in Love of Kill, and with everything quiet again,\u00a0he has the chance to express that side of him once more. He's enamored with Chateau, allowing the shojo side of this seinen-style thriller series to shine forth. The two of them may actually become a couple in a possible Season 2, or at least take the first steps in that direction. There's no longer anyone or anything to get in the way. As Season 1 concludes, Chateau and Ryang-Ha are on the roof when a helicopter arrives and they whip out their pistols, ready for action. By now, they both have a deeper and more respectful understanding of one another and their relationship. Chateau accepts Ryang-Ha as her lovestruck bodyguard\u00a0while he\u00a0acknowledges her as his true equal and partner, and not just someone who needs protection. Despite being the shojo heroine since the start, Chateau relied heavily on Ryang-Ha and other characters for survival and purpose. Now she has truly blossomed, and Ryang-Ha is clearly happy for her. They can face the future and its dangers side by side as co-stars of the winter anime season's bloodiest shojo adventure.

Similar to the streaming company's\u00a0release schedule to the new season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, new episodes of the show are being released intermittently in batches. The last group of new episodes premiered in January; Netflix has yet to announce when it will release further chapters of the show internationally. The Pok\u00e9mon anime is currently celebrating the 25th anniversary\u00a0of its original premiere. The first episode of the series first\u00a0debuted on April 1, 1997, a little more than a year after Game Freak and Nintendo released Pocket Monsters: Red and Green Version for the original black-and-white Game Boy in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. While a year separated the premiere of the anime from the release of the original games in Japan, the TV show premiered in North America just a month after Nintendo released the original games, now localized under the title Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue Versions, in 1998. RELATED:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon TCG Online Is a Great Way for New Players to Learn the Basics The celebration of the anime's big anniversary comes after The Pok\u00e9mon Company wrapped up its year-long celebration 25th anniversary of the video game series. Nintendo and Game Freak released numerous new titles in the series throughout 2021, including Pok\u00e9mon Unite, a free-to-play MOBA-style competitive game and Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, a 3D remake of the main series' original pair of DS games. The Pok\u00e9mon Company recently showed off the future of the series in\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, which will kick off the\u00a0series' ninth generation of games. The\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon anime has always tried to tie itself in with the latest releases in the video game series, so its possible that Master Journeys'\u00a0 anniversary-inspired adventures through past regions may soon end as Ash and Pikachu move on to the latest\u00a0games' Spain-inspired region. Scarlet and Violet are currently scheduled to be released\u00a0for the Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

Similar to the streaming company's\u00a0release schedule to the new season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, new episodes of the show are being released intermittently in batches. The last group of new episodes premiered in January; Netflix has yet to announce when it will release further chapters of the show internationally. The Pok\u00e9mon anime is currently celebrating the 25th anniversary\u00a0of its original premiere. The first episode of the series first\u00a0debuted on April 1, 1997, a little more than a year after Game Freak and Nintendo released Pocket Monsters: Red and Green Version for the original black-and-white Game Boy in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. While a year separated the premiere of the anime from the release of the original games in Japan, the TV show premiered in North America just a month after Nintendo released the original games, now localized under the title Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue Versions, in 1998. RELATED:\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon TCG Online Is a Great Way for New Players to Learn the Basics The celebration of the anime's big anniversary comes after The Pok\u00e9mon Company wrapped up its year-long celebration 25th anniversary of the video game series. Nintendo and Game Freak released numerous new titles in the series throughout 2021, including Pok\u00e9mon Unite, a free-to-play MOBA-style competitive game and Pok\u00e9mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, a 3D remake of the main series' original pair of DS games. The Pok\u00e9mon Company recently showed off the future of the series in\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet, which will kick off the\u00a0series' ninth generation of games. The\u00a0Pok\u00e9mon anime has always tried to tie itself in with the latest releases in the video game series, so its possible that Master Journeys'\u00a0 anniversary-inspired adventures through past regions may soon end as Ash and Pikachu move on to the latest\u00a0games' Spain-inspired region. Scarlet and Violet are currently scheduled to be released\u00a0for the Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

By Gregory Segal Published Mar 22, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Since Platinum End is drawing to a close, it seems like a better time than any to reflect on its main character, Mirai Kakehashi. While many anime viewers have become fans of the show, particularly in light of its unconventional story, the popularity of its protagonist has been far less considerable. Mirai has often been frustrating to watch. He has repeatedly been unable to make important decisions or have the initiative to express his own ideas. While this character's lack of confidence as a God candidate is understandable in light of his age and traumatic past, his passive nature hasn\u2019t exactly led to the most entertaining or endearing moments.  RELATED: How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment                  As a young child, Mirai lived a happy existence with his parents and younger brother. However, at the age of seven, his family was all killed in an apparent accident, which resulted in him being taken in by his relatives. Throughout this period, he was treated poorly, receiving both physical and mental abuse from his father\u2019s sister, her husband and their children. Shortly after meeting Nasse, a special-rank angel, it\u2019s revealed that the death of Mirai\u2019s family was planned by his aunt and uncle in an effort to get their money. Once Mirai is granted access to a pair of wings, a red arrow that can make anyone fall in love with him and a white arrow that can kill any person instantly, he remains determined that he will not use them not to gain wealth or power, but instead true happiness. Consequently, Mirai vows that he will not use his white arrow to kill anyone, as this would go against his goals and be morally unjust. RELATED: Platinum End: Professor Yoneda & Shuji Finally Learn Shonen's Most Vital Lesson This framework goes to some lengths to create a more relatable character. Mirai isn\u2019t completely overpowered, he considers the consequences of his actions and he's afraid of the world around him. This establishes a more realistic dynamic that is often not as seen within mainstream anime, in which a young protagonist is actively aware that they are both naive and vulnerable. Unfortunately, the strictness to which Mirai follows his ethical code goes a little too far. His no-kill policy often leads those around him to get in harm's way and has almost brought humanity to the point of destruction. While it's clear that the creators of the show were attempting to disrupt the anime convention of what it means to be a main character, it has only led Mirai to become more two-dimensional. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Still Afraid to Take the Next Step                  Both people and the decisions they make are not black and white. While life would certainly be a lot easier if this was the case, it simply isn\u2019t. Although Mirai eventually recognizes this (to a degree) and manages to use his white arrow to defend himself against Dr. Yoneda, it all feels too little too late. This character's inability to change his stance ends up being more annoying than it is admirable. While subverting the trope of the action-driven hero is all well and good in theory, in practice, it results in the mundane. Mirai runs, hides or attempts to talk his way out of the majority of challenges that he faces. Although it isn\u2019t surprising that a 15-year-old boy would react in this way, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that this creates a well-constructed story or character arc. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series Is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right  When Mirai eventually gets the courage to take on his opponents, it only makes it more disappointing to know that he will likely not do anything to combat them effectively. Instead, the viewer considers what scenario or person will come to the rescue and allow Mirai to escape unscathed. Although Mirai\u2019s moral code might have worked for a character in another series, the nature of the God candidate's powers means that there is very little he can do to hold to this commitment without passing the buck. Having said this, Mirai was an interesting experiment into how an anime protagonist can be portrayed in a story that would usually be considered as part of the fantasy-action genre. While the result may not have been ideal, it's good to see that writers are challenging conventions by creating characters that don\u2019t fit the expected mold. Nonetheless, Mirai\u2019s strong convictions and apathetic attitude ended up limiting what his character could do and where the story might have progressed. If the creators of Platinum End were to have combined their unconventional story with a more approachable character, the series might have ended up being an even greater success than it has been to date.

RELATED: How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment                  As a young child, Mirai lived a happy existence with his parents and younger brother. However, at the age of seven, his family was all killed in an apparent accident, which resulted in him being taken in by his relatives. Throughout this period, he was treated poorly, receiving both physical and mental abuse from his father\u2019s sister, her husband and their children. Shortly after meeting Nasse, a special-rank angel, it\u2019s revealed that the death of Mirai\u2019s family was planned by his aunt and uncle in an effort to get their money. Once Mirai is granted access to a pair of wings, a red arrow that can make anyone fall in love with him and a white arrow that can kill any person instantly, he remains determined that he will not use them not to gain wealth or power, but instead true happiness. Consequently, Mirai vows that he will not use his white arrow to kill anyone, as this would go against his goals and be morally unjust. RELATED: Platinum End: Professor Yoneda & Shuji Finally Learn Shonen's Most Vital Lesson This framework goes to some lengths to create a more relatable character. Mirai isn\u2019t completely overpowered, he considers the consequences of his actions and he's afraid of the world around him. This establishes a more realistic dynamic that is often not as seen within mainstream anime, in which a young protagonist is actively aware that they are both naive and vulnerable. Unfortunately, the strictness to which Mirai follows his ethical code goes a little too far. His no-kill policy often leads those around him to get in harm's way and has almost brought humanity to the point of destruction. While it's clear that the creators of the show were attempting to disrupt the anime convention of what it means to be a main character, it has only led Mirai to become more two-dimensional. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Still Afraid to Take the Next Step                  Both people and the decisions they make are not black and white. While life would certainly be a lot easier if this was the case, it simply isn\u2019t. Although Mirai eventually recognizes this (to a degree) and manages to use his white arrow to defend himself against Dr. Yoneda, it all feels too little too late. This character's inability to change his stance ends up being more annoying than it is admirable. While subverting the trope of the action-driven hero is all well and good in theory, in practice, it results in the mundane. Mirai runs, hides or attempts to talk his way out of the majority of challenges that he faces. Although it isn\u2019t surprising that a 15-year-old boy would react in this way, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that this creates a well-constructed story or character arc. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series Is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right  When Mirai eventually gets the courage to take on his opponents, it only makes it more disappointing to know that he will likely not do anything to combat them effectively. Instead, the viewer considers what scenario or person will come to the rescue and allow Mirai to escape unscathed. Although Mirai\u2019s moral code might have worked for a character in another series, the nature of the God candidate's powers means that there is very little he can do to hold to this commitment without passing the buck. Having said this, Mirai was an interesting experiment into how an anime protagonist can be portrayed in a story that would usually be considered as part of the fantasy-action genre. While the result may not have been ideal, it's good to see that writers are challenging conventions by creating characters that don\u2019t fit the expected mold. Nonetheless, Mirai\u2019s strong convictions and apathetic attitude ended up limiting what his character could do and where the story might have progressed. If the creators of Platinum End were to have combined their unconventional story with a more approachable character, the series might have ended up being an even greater success than it has been to date.

The world-shaking anime adaptation of Hajime Isayama's\u00a0Attack on Titan is finally heading toward its conclusion. Its current set of episodes has left viewers questioning everything that they know about the series, from the nature of the world that the Eldians inhabit to the motivations of the show's most central character. However, even with so many questions hanging in the air, one puzzle in particular seems to be plaguing audiences -- is episode 87, which is set to debut within the next few days, really the conclusion of the television anime?  RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper                  At first glance, the answer to this query seems relatively straightforward. Prior to the premiere of the ongoing run, the series' studio MAPPA listed Season 4, Part 2 as consisting of 12 episodes. Furthermore, while many widely popular shows like\u00a0Demon Slayer have made use of extra-long episodes to either conclude or kick off storylines, as they did in the most recent \"Entertainment District\" arc, this does not appear to be the case with\u00a0Attack on Titan. Although there has been no such denial of an elongated finale from any official source, discussion online has pointed to Japanese television guides to corroborate the standard 25-minute timeslot. Streaming service Crunchyroll\u00a0even hyped up the upcoming episode as the finale, releasing a special teaser trailer leaning into the tension of the upcoming fight to stop Eren from annihilating the outside world.                  Nevertheless, the apocalypse-level struggle between Eren and his former comrades seems to warrant far more screentime than a single episode can provide. This is especially true because\u00a0the episode's title, \"Dawn of Humanity,\" correlates with a manga chapter of the same name -- one that has nine chapters of content after it. Since the show's most recent season has maintained a pace of one chapter per episode, squeezing ten full chapters into a single episode would be a massive shift in pace, no matter how long said episode is. RELATED:\u00a0How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? This has led fans to speculate about the possibility that rather than conclude the anime on television, MAPPA could be planning to finish things off with a movie instead. Recent box office hits like\u00a0Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and\u00a0Demon Slayer: Mugen Train have proven that anime films related to ongoing series can be just as lucrative as any other feature. That being said, neither of these two served as series finales, with the former being a prequel and the latter depicting a mid-season arc.                  While there have been movies that were released after the closing of their anime series, these have typically resembled epilogues, side stories or teases for potential continuations, such as\u00a0The Last: Naruto the Movie or\u00a0Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie - Rebellion. Utilizing a movie as the true ending of a series would be fairly unprecedented, with the exception of features such as\u00a0The End of Evangelion -- although even that was more of an alternate version of the televised ending rather than the definitive final act. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan Theory: Zeke's Spinal Fluid Led to [SPOILER's] Unique Transformation Another possibility is that MAPPA is planning on extending their so-called \"Final Season\" once more into a third part. This might sound like a somewhat misleading ploy at stringing viewers along, but it wouldn't be entirely surprising either. During the initial airing of Season 1, Part 1, there was little mention that the \"Final Season\" would be broken up into segments that would air a little over a year apart from each other. The remaining number of chapters could easily be enough to constitute a Part 3 on their own, especially if they include extended fight scenes and afterword material.                  Whatever the resolution may be, Episode 87 is currently expected to be the final episode,\u00a0at least as far as Season 4, Part 2 is concerned. Regardless of\u00a0any further announcement of a continuation or decision to wrap it all up in one go, there is no word on there being more to\u00a0Attack on Titan in the foreseeable future. Still, MAPPA has done an excellent job of adapting the series thus far, giving each chapter the attention and time it needs to shine. One can only hope that this upcoming episode, whatever it may be, will be treated in the same way.

Naruto: What Is Haku's Gender? Though the gender of Haku in the early chapters of Naruto may seem ambiguous, there's a firm answer given about the youth in the anime and manga.     By Timothy Donohoo Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the story of\u00a0Naruto developed, more and more now-classic characters were introduced. These include the bushy-browed Rock Lee, as well as the villainous Orochimaru. One character\u00a0who was brought in and quickly gotten rid of, however, was Haku. This underling of Zabuza was part of one of the franchise's earlier arcs, but many\u00a0fans continue to ask about the mysterious Haku's gender. Haku is incredibly soft-spoken, and due to the character's appearance, even Naruto isn't sure what to make of the situation. Despite this confusion, the gender of Haku is indeed clearly stated in the manga and anime. Here's which sex the young ninja belongs to.  RELATED:\u00a0What Exactly Is Naruto's 'Springtime of Youth'? What Is Haku's Gender In Naruto?                  The \"Prologue - Land of Waves\" arc was one of the earliest in\u00a0Naruto, directly preceding the Chunin Exams. The central villain of this saga was Zabuza, a ninja who wielded a gigantic sword. Serving alongside\u00a0him was the much more diminutive Haku, who also had a much less obviously masculine design. Thanks to this, combined with\u00a0a soft voice and kimono, many erroneously assume that Haku is female. Naruto even mentions this, stating that the young person he encounters is even prettier than Sakura. Haku, however, is not a young lady, but instead a young man. He makes this plain to Naruto, who then states his aforementioned attraction to the lad. From then on, any confusion as to which gender Haku is has been clarified, and he's firmly referred to as a boy for the rest of his short life. RELATED:\u00a0How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment What Is Haku's Origin in Naruto?                  Before tagging along with Zabuza, Haku was a young boy who lived with his parents in the Land of Water. Unfortunately, this happy domestic existence soon came to an end when it was revealed that Haku had inherited a kekkei genkai, or bloodline trait technique. An example of this includes\u00a0the classic Rasengan and Sharingan attacks. The ensuing conflict led to the death of Haku's parents, with the orphan thereafter staying with the wayward Zabuza. There's nothing about this origin that really explains why Haku is so feminine in appearance or voice. This is accentuated by some of the clothing he wears, which is vibrant and pink. To be fair, softer features and voices would definitely be more common in the East for men, especially for someone as young as Haku. Sadly, he didn't live much longer after Naruto met him, dying to defend his friend Zabuza.\u00a0They were both\u00a0later revived by Kabuto, though these were mindless zombies without the personality of who they once were. Since then, the delicate looking young\u00a0Haku has never been seen again.

Though the gender of Haku in the early chapters of Naruto may seem ambiguous, there's a firm answer given about the youth in the anime and manga.     By Timothy Donohoo Published Mar 24, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    As the story of\u00a0Naruto developed, more and more now-classic characters were introduced. These include the bushy-browed Rock Lee, as well as the villainous Orochimaru. One character\u00a0who was brought in and quickly gotten rid of, however, was Haku. This underling of Zabuza was part of one of the franchise's earlier arcs, but many\u00a0fans continue to ask about the mysterious Haku's gender. Haku is incredibly soft-spoken, and due to the character's appearance, even Naruto isn't sure what to make of the situation. Despite this confusion, the gender of Haku is indeed clearly stated in the manga and anime. Here's which sex the young ninja belongs to.  RELATED:\u00a0What Exactly Is Naruto's 'Springtime of Youth'? What Is Haku's Gender In Naruto?                  The \"Prologue - Land of Waves\" arc was one of the earliest in\u00a0Naruto, directly preceding the Chunin Exams. The central villain of this saga was Zabuza, a ninja who wielded a gigantic sword. Serving alongside\u00a0him was the much more diminutive Haku, who also had a much less obviously masculine design. Thanks to this, combined with\u00a0a soft voice and kimono, many erroneously assume that Haku is female. Naruto even mentions this, stating that the young person he encounters is even prettier than Sakura. Haku, however, is not a young lady, but instead a young man. He makes this plain to Naruto, who then states his aforementioned attraction to the lad. From then on, any confusion as to which gender Haku is has been clarified, and he's firmly referred to as a boy for the rest of his short life. RELATED:\u00a0How Boruto Paid Homage to Naruto & Sasuke's Most Explosive Moment What Is Haku's Origin in Naruto?                  Before tagging along with Zabuza, Haku was a young boy who lived with his parents in the Land of Water. Unfortunately, this happy domestic existence soon came to an end when it was revealed that Haku had inherited a kekkei genkai, or bloodline trait technique. An example of this includes\u00a0the classic Rasengan and Sharingan attacks. The ensuing conflict led to the death of Haku's parents, with the orphan thereafter staying with the wayward Zabuza. There's nothing about this origin that really explains why Haku is so feminine in appearance or voice. This is accentuated by some of the clothing he wears, which is vibrant and pink. To be fair, softer features and voices would definitely be more common in the East for men, especially for someone as young as Haku. Sadly, he didn't live much longer after Naruto met him, dying to defend his friend Zabuza.\u00a0They were both\u00a0later revived by Kabuto, though these were mindless zombies without the personality of who they once were. Since then, the delicate looking young\u00a0Haku has never been seen again.

By Michael Lacerna Published 22 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A massive new Fullmetal Alchemist statue has been unveiled, but it might be one of the costliest exchanges in the series' history. Good Smile Company is now taking preorders on its new Edward and Alphonse Elric statue. The massive statue is 16 inches tall and 17 inches wide, and depicts the brothers in\u00a0battle as Ed transmutes his automail arm\u00a0into a dagger and Al transforms the ground to give his older sibling a boost. True to\u00a0the series' law of equivalent exchange, the highly detailed and sizable figure comes with an equally hefty\u00a0price tag: $2,199.99 USD. The preorder window for the statue will close on May 11, though hardcore fans will want to scrounge together the funds quickly, however, as Good Smile warns only a limited number of the statues will be produced and the preorder window may close early if orders meet\u00a0the production limit.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan                                                       In order to illustrate just how large the new, non-scale statue is, Good Smile Company released an image that compares the figure to one of the company's Fullmetal Alchemist Nendoroid figures, which usually stand between 3-4 inches tall. Fullmetal Alchemist was created by celebrated manga author and artist Hiromu Arakawa in 2001. The series was one of the most popular manga series of the early '00s, achieving a global circulation of over 80 million copies. The series tells the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use their natural talent in alchemy -- the ability to transform one object into another -- to try to resurrect their beloved mother after she suddenly passes away. The attempt goes horribly awry and costs Ed an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body and is only able to survive by having his soul anchored to an old suit of armor. Devastated by their losses, the two brothers join their country's military force, where they work as State Alchemists as they try to find a legendary artifact that will let them undo their biggest mistake. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer Arakawa's\u00a0critically acclaimed manga\u00a0received two anime adaptations: the first was produced in 2003, before the manga was completed, and consequently features a substantially different story line and ending. A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, premiered in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of Arakawa's original work and is now generally regarded as the superior adaptation. The series has also been adapted into a series of live-action movies, the first of which was released in 2017. The second and third entries in the trilogy are scheduled to be released in Japan later this year. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan                                                       In order to illustrate just how large the new, non-scale statue is, Good Smile Company released an image that compares the figure to one of the company's Fullmetal Alchemist Nendoroid figures, which usually stand between 3-4 inches tall. Fullmetal Alchemist was created by celebrated manga author and artist Hiromu Arakawa in 2001. The series was one of the most popular manga series of the early '00s, achieving a global circulation of over 80 million copies. The series tells the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use their natural talent in alchemy -- the ability to transform one object into another -- to try to resurrect their beloved mother after she suddenly passes away. The attempt goes horribly awry and costs Ed an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body and is only able to survive by having his soul anchored to an old suit of armor. Devastated by their losses, the two brothers join their country's military force, where they work as State Alchemists as they try to find a legendary artifact that will let them undo their biggest mistake. RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer Arakawa's\u00a0critically acclaimed manga\u00a0received two anime adaptations: the first was produced in 2003, before the manga was completed, and consequently features a substantially different story line and ending. A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, premiered in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of Arakawa's original work and is now generally regarded as the superior adaptation. The series has also been adapted into a series of live-action movies, the first of which was released in 2017. The second and third entries in the trilogy are scheduled to be released in Japan later this year. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

The new \"preview art\" was posted to the official Japanese Twitter account for the series, and posts a faux-announcement of a new My Hero Academia series, in which Japan's pro-heroes and UA High students give up on the becoming superheroes and instead dedicate themselves to becoming professional baseball players. The heroes form four teams based around the series' pro-hero talent agencies: the Orcas, a team lead by Gang Orca, the Shishido Agency Lionels, Mt. Lady's Mountains and the Fat Gum Agency Fats. Several members of Class 1-A, including Kyoka Jiro and Denki Kaminari, are shown playing in the new league.

In 2019, the series announced a new (fake) movie, The Giant Monster Bakugo, in which Deku's explosive rival,\u00a0Katsuki Bakugo, gets transformed into a giant, Godzilla-like monster. The gag adds some levity to the series,\u00a0which is currently in the middle of its dramatic final story arc. The series has already wrapped up a number of long-running plot threads, including the reveal of the traitor within UA High, and is rapidly barreling towards the final confrontation between the supervillain mastermind All for One and the current holder of One for All, Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya, that it has been setting up for almost a decade. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia: Toga's New Support Item Imitates a Powerful One For All Ability Series creator Kohei\u00a0Horikoshi and Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha have been teasing the series' end for quite some time now, and while no definitive end date has been announced yet, Horikoshi stated at last December's Jump Festa event\u00a0that he plans to conclude the super hero manga sometime before the end of 2022. The manga was first published in 2014, and has been a huge commercial success, with a\u00a0global circulation of over 65 million copies. The My Hero Academia anime, meanwhile, still has plenty of content left to adapt.\u00a0The sixth season of the show, which will concentrate on the Paranormal Liberation War arc, will premiere next fall. The arc features an all-out war between Japan's pro-heroes and the Paranormal Liberation Army, which was united under the leadership of the twisted Tomura Shigaraki in Season 5.

By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Hero Academia's April Fools gag reimagines the series as a sports anime. The new \"preview art\" was posted to the official Japanese Twitter account for the series, and posts a faux-announcement of a new My Hero Academia series, in which Japan's pro-heroes and UA High students give up on the becoming superheroes and instead dedicate themselves to becoming professional baseball players. The heroes form four teams based around the series' pro-hero talent agencies: the Orcas, a team lead by Gang Orca, the Shishido Agency Lionels, Mt. Lady's Mountains and the Fat Gum Agency Fats. Several members of Class 1-A, including Kyoka Jiro and Denki Kaminari, are shown playing in the new league.

In 2019, the series announced a new (fake) movie, The Giant Monster Bakugo, in which Deku's explosive rival,\u00a0Katsuki Bakugo, gets transformed into a giant, Godzilla-like monster. The gag adds some levity to the series,\u00a0which is currently in the middle of its dramatic final story arc. The series has already wrapped up a number of long-running plot threads, including the reveal of the traitor within UA High, and is rapidly barreling towards the final confrontation between the supervillain mastermind All for One and the current holder of One for All, Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya, that it has been setting up for almost a decade. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia: Toga's New Support Item Imitates a Powerful One For All Ability Series creator Kohei\u00a0Horikoshi and Shonen Jump publisher Shueisha have been teasing the series' end for quite some time now, and while no definitive end date has been announced yet, Horikoshi stated at last December's Jump Festa event\u00a0that he plans to conclude the super hero manga sometime before the end of 2022. The manga was first published in 2014, and has been a huge commercial success, with a\u00a0global circulation of over 65 million copies. The My Hero Academia anime, meanwhile, still has plenty of content left to adapt.\u00a0The sixth season of the show, which will concentrate on the Paranormal Liberation War arc, will premiere next fall. The arc features an all-out war between Japan's pro-heroes and the Paranormal Liberation Army, which was united under the leadership of the twisted Tomura Shigaraki in Season 5. The My Hero Academia manga is available in English from VIZ Media. The anime series is available for streaming on Crunchyroll, Netflix and Hulu.

Here's some of the best isekai where the main character goes home.     By Jessie Xu Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The isekai genre has exploded into popularity in recent years, leading to an oversaturation in new adaptations. The idea of the main character restarting life in a new and exciting world of fantasy is appealing to many viewers, and that demand has led to the subgenre developing its own set of tropes.  A popular trope within this subgenre is the process of the protagonist trying to find their way home. However, there are a rare few instances where\u00a0they actually succeed in doing so. Here are some of the best\u00a0isekai anime where the main character goes against all odds to return home. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept  Re:Creators Turns the Tables on Classic Isekai                  Starting off with an unconventional and refreshing take on the isekai genre is Re:Creators. This series challenges the conventional trope of the underdog reincarnating into a fantasy world;\u00a0this time, it\u2019s the characters from fictional worlds\u00a0who are out of place in the real world. Its unique concept and clever use of the reverse isekai genre make it one of the best isekai where the main characters return home.  The Devil Is a Part-Timer! Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This\u00a0anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity. RELATED: How 'A Realist Hero' Struggles Against\u00a0Isekai Fantasy Cliches\u00a0 Sword Art Online: The Famous (Or Infamous) Isekai Classic                  Hailed as the series that catapulted isekai into popularity -- for better or for worse --\u00a0Sword Art Online has made a permanent mark in anime history. It would be a sin to not include this long-time classic. When a virtual reality game becomes a deathtrap for the millions of players logged on, there is only one thought pushing protagonists Kirito and Asuna forward: the hope of returning home. RELATED: How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Dog Days Is the Underdog of the Isekai Genre                  Dog Days may not be the best-known isekai among the wider anime community, but it is certainly unique.\u00a0This story follows the adventures of Cinque Izumi and his friends when they are invited to represent different kingdoms on an alternate Earth. The inhabitants are human-like beings with animal characteristics who fight wars through sporting competitions.  This lighthearted adaptation takes a peaceful approach toward the age-old question about the main character\u2019s home. Protagonists are able to easily cross between both worlds, eliminating the dilemma entirely. RELATED: The Best Isekai With OP Main Characters Inuyasha Is the Classic Shoujo Isekai Fantasy                  Inuyasha has long since cemented itself as a classic shoujo series within the anime community. It tells of a classic love story across worlds and time periods between Kagome, a girl tasked with saving the world, and Inuyasha, a hybrid dog demon/human tasked with protecting her -- all while weaving a tasteful combination of comedy and romance. At first Kagome is able to easily cross between both worlds, but ultimately she'll have to make a decision between the two. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons Digimon Adventure Is a Trip Down Memory Lane                  The Digimon franchise has become one of the best-known anime franchises geared toward children along with classics like Pokemon. Taichi Yagami and his friends are suddenly transported to a \u2018Digital World\u2019 while\u00a0at summer camp. Follow their exciting adventures as they journey to find their way home alongside strange creatures known as Digimon.

Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This\u00a0anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity. RELATED: How 'A Realist Hero' Struggles Against\u00a0Isekai Fantasy Cliches\u00a0 Sword Art Online: The Famous (Or Infamous) Isekai Classic                  Hailed as the series that catapulted isekai into popularity -- for better or for worse --\u00a0Sword Art Online has made a permanent mark in anime history. It would be a sin to not include this long-time classic. When a virtual reality game becomes a deathtrap for the millions of players logged on, there is only one thought pushing protagonists Kirito and Asuna forward: the hope of returning home. RELATED: How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Dog Days Is the Underdog of the Isekai Genre                  Dog Days may not be the best-known isekai among the wider anime community, but it is certainly unique.\u00a0This story follows the adventures of Cinque Izumi and his friends when they are invited to represent different kingdoms on an alternate Earth. The inhabitants are human-like beings with animal characteristics who fight wars through sporting competitions.  This lighthearted adaptation takes a peaceful approach toward the age-old question about the main character\u2019s home. Protagonists are able to easily cross between both worlds, eliminating the dilemma entirely. RELATED: The Best Isekai With OP Main Characters Inuyasha Is the Classic Shoujo Isekai Fantasy                  Inuyasha has long since cemented itself as a classic shoujo series within the anime community. It tells of a classic love story across worlds and time periods between Kagome, a girl tasked with saving the world, and Inuyasha, a hybrid dog demon/human tasked with protecting her -- all while weaving a tasteful combination of comedy and romance. At first Kagome is able to easily cross between both worlds, but ultimately she'll have to make a decision between the two. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons Digimon Adventure Is a Trip Down Memory Lane                  The Digimon franchise has become one of the best-known anime franchises geared toward children along with classics like Pokemon.

Stuck on their desolate hill in the jungle, surrounded and outnumbered by Japanese forces, the British dig in for the long haul \u2013 but events elsewhere conspire to rob them of supplies and resources they so desperately need. As the perimeter shrinks under relentless enemy assault, more and more of the men reach their breaking point \u2013 and not just on the front line, with even medical personnel forced into almost impossible decisions.

Let's dive into its differences.     By Jenelle Catherina Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Winter 2022 was quite an eventful season for anime, but nothing stood out more like\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling. Equally loved for the adorable romance between the main characters Gojo and Marin and\u00a0critiqued for the over-the-top and excessive fanservice, this anime has had fans talking since Episode 1. Now that the final episode of Season 1 has aired, it has been critically acclaimed as a pretty true-to-manga adaptation. Still, nothing is ever perfect, and there are some small changes within the anime -- so what changed exactly from the manga to the anime? RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling\u2019s Pervasive Fan Service Undermines a Positive Message  The first change occurs right away in the opening of Episode 1. In the anime, we see a young Gojo looking up and admiring his grandfather's doll, mesmerized by its beauty. In the manga, there's no sign here of a young Gojo, just a younger version of his grandfather telling an off-panel Gojo about how he too can make dolls one day, before abruptly showing the traumatic moment in his childhood where his former friend disowns him for his \"feminine\" hobby. Obviously, this is only a minor change. The first major change in the first episode is the manner in which Marin and Gojo first interact with each other. In the manga, she merely bumps into him and apologizes, but in the anime, Marin's encounter is more over-the-top. She is seen literally flying through the air and landing head-first on the corner of Gojo's desk, which honestly looks very concussion-inducing. A moment later though, she reveals that she is completely fine. This change was probably added to set up the outlandishness and comedy of the show.                  In Episode 5, the anime cuts a scene that occurs while Gojo is taking Marin's photos as Shizuku-tan for the first time. In the manga, Gojo is visibly flustered after Marin states she didn't bring any clothes to change back into. This scene is exchanged in favor of a simpler smartphone photo montage. Similarly in Episode 8, during the beach scene, a fan-servicey panty shot scene is replaced in favor of a bird stealing Marin and Gojo's lunch. In contrast, the iconic love hotel episode is adapted to the tee with no changes whatsoever, much to the excitement of manga fans. The final episode of the series has the most manga to anime changes. It starts off right away with a minor change. In the manga, the episode opens with Gojo working on his next cosplay project, while in the anime, he is working on a doll. The biggest cut in this scene is the presence of Marin's father. In the manga, he comes home to check on Marin and is upset when she reveals that she hasn't been doing her homework, which prompts her to study with Gojo. In the anime, this conversation is reduced to a phone call, and viewers never see Marin's father on screen. RELATED:\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Definitely Written for the Female Gaze Another huge change is the order of events. In the manga, the events occur as follows: the encounter with Marin's father, the school pool scene, the fireworks festival and the scary movie sequence. However, in the anime, the\u00a0movie scene is split in two and bookends the episode. It occurs as such: movie, pool scene, festival, then concludes with Marin calling Gojo about how scared she is in the post-credit scene after watching the movie's sequel by herself. Understandably, the writers wanted the season to end on a happy note, so they likely changed things around so that Marin could end the season saying the long-awaited \"I love you\" to Gojo, even if he didn't actually hear it. The season ends with Marin looking directly at the camera and saying \"See you later,\" which is probably intended to be a heartfelt fourth wall break.                  Evidently, the anime follows the manga quite closely, and besides some minor cuts and chronological changes, there are no major plot differences from the manga to the movie, which has pleased manga fans. With such a great first season, will the second season be able to hold up? There is no announcement for the second season as of yet, but judging by its success, there will no doubt be an announcement sometime soon.

Let's dive into its differences.     By Jenelle Catherina Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Winter 2022 was quite an eventful season for anime, but nothing stood out more like\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling. Equally loved for the adorable romance between the main characters Gojo and Marin and\u00a0critiqued for the over-the-top and excessive fanservice, this anime has had fans talking since Episode 1. Now that the final episode of Season 1 has aired, it has been critically acclaimed as a pretty true-to-manga adaptation. Still, nothing is ever perfect, and there are some small changes within the anime -- so what changed exactly from the manga to the anime? RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling\u2019s Pervasive Fan Service Undermines a Positive Message  The first change occurs right away in the opening of Episode 1. In the anime, we see a young Gojo looking up and admiring his grandfather's doll, mesmerized by its beauty. In the manga, there's no sign here of a young Gojo, just a younger version of his grandfather telling an off-panel Gojo about how he too can make dolls one day, before abruptly showing the traumatic moment in his childhood where his former friend disowns him for his \"feminine\" hobby. Obviously, this is only a minor change. The first major change in the first episode is the manner in which Marin and Gojo first interact with each other. In the manga, she merely bumps into him and apologizes, but in the anime, Marin's encounter is more over-the-top. She is seen literally flying through the air and landing head-first on the corner of Gojo's desk, which honestly looks very concussion-inducing. A moment later though, she reveals that she is completely fine. This change was probably added to set up the outlandishness and comedy of the show.                  In Episode 5, the anime cuts a scene that occurs while Gojo is taking Marin's photos as Shizuku-tan for the first time. In the manga, Gojo is visibly flustered after Marin states she didn't bring any clothes to change back into. This scene is exchanged in favor of a simpler smartphone photo montage. Similarly in Episode 8, during the beach scene, a fan-servicey panty shot scene is replaced in favor of a bird stealing Marin and Gojo's lunch. In contrast, the iconic love hotel episode is adapted to the tee with no changes whatsoever, much to the excitement of manga fans. The final episode of the series has the most manga to anime changes. It starts off right away with a minor change. In the manga, the episode opens with Gojo working on his next cosplay project, while in the anime, he is working on a doll. The biggest cut in this scene is the presence of Marin's father. In the manga, he comes home to check on Marin and is upset when she reveals that she hasn't been doing her homework, which prompts her to study with Gojo. In the anime, this conversation is reduced to a phone call, and viewers never see Marin's father on screen. RELATED:\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Definitely Written for the Female Gaze Another huge change is the order of events. In the manga, the events occur as follows: the encounter with Marin's father, the school pool scene, the fireworks festival and the scary movie sequence. However, in the anime, the\u00a0movie scene is split in two and bookends the episode. It occurs as such: movie, pool scene, festival, then concludes with Marin calling Gojo about how scared she is in the post-credit scene after watching the movie's sequel by herself. Understandably, the writers wanted the season to end on a happy note, so they likely changed things around so that Marin could end the season saying the long-awaited \"I love you\" to Gojo, even if he didn't actually hear it. The season ends with Marin looking directly at the camera and saying \"See you later,\" which is probably intended to be a heartfelt fourth wall break.                  Evidently, the anime follows the manga quite closely, and besides some minor cuts and chronological changes, there are no major plot differences from the manga to the movie, which has pleased manga fans. With such a great first season, will the second season be able to hold up? There is no announcement for the second season as of yet, but judging by its success, there will no doubt be an announcement sometime soon.

However, despite being predominantly a sports anime, there have been hints at potential romances throughout the story, with a love triangle forming between the three main characters of Chihaya Ayase, Taichi Mashima and Arata Wataya. Taichi harbors a one-sided crush on the currently oblivious Chihaya, while Chihaya seems to harbor feelings of deep admiration -- possibly more -- for their long-distant friend Arata. While being part of the main storyline from the beginning and a key form of entertainment for some fans, Chihayafuru has so much going for it that the series would be just fine even if there are never any full-blown romantic relationships.

She aims to be Queen -- a title awarded to the best female karuta player in Japan -- and she chases this dream with an admirable level of passion, so much so that karuta becomes the focal point of her world. Chihaya dedicates so much love and hard work to the game that her wins are satisfying and her losses difficult to watch, to the point where fans can't help but root for her. Despite\u00a0excelling both academically and in sports, Taichi is not naturally gifted and works extremely hard to attain perfection due to the high expectations placed upon him by his strict mother.\u00a0As such, he struggles to learn karuta, although is encouraged by the joy he finds in the game through playing with his friends, Chihaya and Arata. While he first became interested in the game because of Chihaya, over time, he has genuinely come to love it. Arata introduced Karuta to both Chihaya and Taichi.\u00a0He is hailed as a prodigy in this field and was taught the game by his grandfather, Hajime Wataya, a renowned master in the karuta world. Arata was close with his grandfather, but when he passed away due to illness, Arata began carrying the weight of his grandfather's death on his shoulders.

By Louis Kemner Published 5 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Platinum End Episode 24, \"The Final Arrow,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, as well as discussion of suicide. Platinum End's\u00a0divine battle royale to decide\u00a0the world's\u00a0next God ended in Episode 23, and peace returns to Earth in the series finale as the\u00a0new God Shuji takes his place in the heavens and the arrows are confiscated. Only one red arrow remains with Professor Yoneda,\u00a0but\u00a0otherwise it's as though the titanic\u00a0clash never even happened. Few people even retain memories of it happening. Protagonist Kakehashi Mirai can now resume his humble quest to find true happiness as an ordinary citizen of Earth, and the other God candidates and their associates do the same. While the new God has apocalyptic plans in mind, not even the end of humanity can extinguish true hope and happiness. That is the shonen way.  RELATED: Platinum End's Finale Reveals the Truth of the God Selection Process                  In heaven, the new God-Shuji converses with the original God and they resolve the \"chicken and the egg\" paradox between humanity and God at last. An unknown party or entity created God long ago. God then created humanity, disproving Yoneda's \"parasitic creature\" theory. Meanwhile, God-Shuji observes humanity's endless suffering across the globe and concludes that nothing short of genocide can save\u00a0it from despair\u00a0and misery. As the destructive angel Munai had always intended, God-Shuji takes his own life, and the angels and humanity die with him in a massive apocalypse six years after the God candidate battle ended. Starting with the youngest, everyone on Earth vanishes into thin air. Most people feel horror and shock as they see everyone else vanish, until the same happens to them as well. It's a nightmare scenario for 99% of humanity, but one particular couple doesn't mind it so much. Mirai and Saki, who have since gotten married and started their own florist shop, embrace one another and wait for the end to come. Both had once tried to take their own lives but survived, giving each of them a new appreciation of their remaining time on Earth. They perish with no regrets, and even if he must pay for it with his life, Mirai spends his last moments in happiness with the woman he loves as his initial quest comes to a close. This allows Mirai to die happily, as opposed to his misery when he first attempted to take his own life at the start of Platinum End. On one level, this can be interpreted as a suicide prevention message, but there is more to it. RELATED: How Biblically Accurate Are the Angels in Platinum End?                  The sudden apocalypse in\u00a0Platinum End finale\u00a0does more than conclude the series by killing off the entire cast at once. It also reaffirms a few basic shonen core values, such as the power of friendship, the virtues of courage and persistence, and the wisdom of seeking selfless and constructive goals. Mirai's goal to find humble happiness may have seemed underwhelming earlier in the series -- especially compared to Light Yagami's quest to become a god of justice in Death Note\u00a0-- but in the end, Mirai gets the last laugh. He perishes in Saki's arms as the happiest man on earth, with no fear or regrets at all. His simple and mundane goal had allowed him to spend the prior six years in total bliss, and in Episode 24 he dies in peace, and something similar can be said for his wife Saki.\u00a0However, this generally cannot be said for the rest of Platinum End's cast. The other characters behaved in more selfish ways, and their deaths were equally harsh. The ambitious and cruel Metropoliman died in anguish when Mukaido shot him with a heavy machine gun, and in Episode 24, Professor Yoneda dies while panicking about the state of the world. The selfish hedonist Temari Yuri dies panicking and confused, a poor way to end her life. These characters never sought humble happiness, nor did they try to benefit others. So they receive a fitting end in the finale, while the shonen heroes Mirai and Saki get the best possible end -- a true platinum end.

By Louis Kemner Published 5 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Platinum End Episode 24, \"The Final Arrow,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, as well as discussion of suicide. Platinum End's\u00a0divine battle royale to decide\u00a0the world's\u00a0next God ended in Episode 23, and peace returns to Earth in the series finale as the\u00a0new God Shuji takes his place in the heavens and the arrows are confiscated. Only one red arrow remains with Professor Yoneda,\u00a0but\u00a0otherwise it's as though the titanic\u00a0clash never even happened. Few people even retain memories of it happening. Protagonist Kakehashi Mirai can now resume his humble quest to find true happiness as an ordinary citizen of Earth, and the other God candidates and their associates do the same. While the new God has apocalyptic plans in mind, not even the end of humanity can extinguish true hope and happiness. That is the shonen way.  RELATED: Platinum End's Finale Reveals the Truth of the God Selection Process                  In heaven, the new God-Shuji converses with the original God and they resolve the \"chicken and the egg\" paradox between humanity and God at last. An unknown party or entity created God long ago. God then created humanity, disproving Yoneda's \"parasitic creature\" theory. Meanwhile, God-Shuji observes humanity's endless suffering across the globe and concludes that nothing short of genocide can save\u00a0it from despair\u00a0and misery. As the destructive angel Munai had always intended, God-Shuji takes his own life, and the angels and humanity die with him in a massive apocalypse six years after the God candidate battle ended. Starting with the youngest, everyone on Earth vanishes into thin air. Most people feel horror and shock as they see everyone else vanish, until the same happens to them as well. It's a nightmare scenario for 99% of humanity, but one particular couple doesn't mind it so much. Mirai and Saki, who have since gotten married and started their own florist shop, embrace one another and wait for the end to come. Both had once tried to take their own lives but survived, giving each of them a new appreciation of their remaining time on Earth. They perish with no regrets, and even if he must pay for it with his life, Mirai spends his last moments in happiness with the woman he loves as his initial quest comes to a close. This allows Mirai to die happily, as opposed to his misery when he first attempted to take his own life at the start of Platinum End. On one level, this can be interpreted as a suicide prevention message, but there is more to it. RELATED: How Biblically Accurate Are the Angels in Platinum End?                  The sudden apocalypse in\u00a0Platinum End finale\u00a0does more than conclude the series by killing off the entire cast at once. It also reaffirms a few basic shonen core values, such as the power of friendship, the virtues of courage and persistence, and the wisdom of seeking selfless and constructive goals. Mirai's goal to find humble happiness may have seemed underwhelming earlier in the series -- especially compared to Light Yagami's quest to become a god of justice in Death Note\u00a0-- but in the end, Mirai gets the last laugh. He perishes in Saki's arms as the happiest man on earth, with no fear or regrets at all. His simple and mundane goal had allowed him to spend the prior six years in total bliss, and in Episode 24 he dies in peace, and something similar can be said for his wife Saki.\u00a0However, this generally cannot be said for the rest of Platinum End's cast. The other characters behaved in more selfish ways, and their deaths were equally harsh. The ambitious and cruel Metropoliman died in anguish when Mukaido shot him with a heavy machine gun, and in Episode 24, Professor Yoneda dies while panicking about the state of the world. The selfish hedonist Temari Yuri dies panicking and confused, a poor way to end her life. These characters never sought humble happiness, nor did they try to benefit others. So they receive a fitting end in the finale, while the shonen heroes Mirai and Saki get the best possible end -- a true platinum end.

By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    One of isekai anime's most common tropes is the basis for Wikipedia's April Fools' gag this year. The joke is tucked away in Wikipedia's Did You Know section for April 1. In between\u00a0joke facts about The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, the page states \"Did you know that a common way to travel to another world is to be hit by a truck?\" The bullet point links out to the Wikipedia entries for the isekai genre and the Truck-kun meme that it spawned. A screencap of the section is provided below. RELATED:\u00a0How \u2018A Realist Hero\u2019 Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches                   \"Isekai,\" a term roughly translated to \"other world,\" refers to a genre of story that involves the protagonist, who is usually from the real world, being transported into a fantasy or sci-fi world that is substantially different from our own. While stories using this setup have existed for sometime, the genre has exploded in popularity in Japan\u00a0within the last decade, with the most popular examples being Sword Art Online, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, So I'm a Spider So What and KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World.\u00a0  Notably, many of the genre's protagonists, including the heroes of Mushoku Tensei and Didn't I Say To Make My Abilities Average In The Next Life?!, find themselves transported to their new worlds after being struck and killed by an oncoming truck, usually while pushing somebody else out of the way. The trope has become so ubiquitous that\u00a0it spawned the Truck-kun meme, which posits that the truck is a reoccurring\u00a0anime character that possesses\u00a0one of the highest body counts in the history of the medium. The cliche was lampooned in the set-up for one of the genre's most popular series, KonoSuba, in which the hero initially believes he died saving a beautiful girl from an oncoming truck, but is later told that the vehicle was actually a slow-moving tractor that the girl easily avoided, and that his actual cause of death was the stress caused by his overreaction to the situation. The joke has even spawned its own parody manga, Isekai Transporter, which casts the truck as a noble figure that heroically sends young people to be reincarnated into the worlds that need them most. RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai Many of the previously mentioned isekai anime series are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Isekai Quartet, a crossover series featuring characters from many of the genre's most popular shows, will premiere a new movie in Japan on June 10.

By Michael Lacerna Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    One of isekai anime's most common tropes is the basis for Wikipedia's April Fools' gag this year. The joke is tucked away in Wikipedia's Did You Know section for April 1. In between\u00a0joke facts about The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, the page states \"Did you know that a common way to travel to another world is to be hit by a truck?\" The bullet point links out to the Wikipedia entries for the isekai genre and the Truck-kun meme that it spawned. A screencap of the section is provided below. RELATED:\u00a0How \u2018A Realist Hero\u2019 Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches                   \"Isekai,\" a term roughly translated to \"other world,\" refers to a genre of story that involves the protagonist, who is usually from the real world, being transported into a fantasy or sci-fi world that is substantially different from our own. While stories using this setup have existed for sometime, the genre has exploded in popularity in Japan\u00a0within the last decade, with the most popular examples being Sword Art Online, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, So I'm a Spider So What and KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World.\u00a0  Notably, many of the genre's protagonists, including the heroes of Mushoku Tensei and Didn't I Say To Make My Abilities Average In The Next Life?!, find themselves transported to their new worlds after being struck and killed by an oncoming truck, usually while pushing somebody else out of the way. The trope has become so ubiquitous that\u00a0it spawned the Truck-kun meme, which posits that the truck is a reoccurring\u00a0anime character that possesses\u00a0one of the highest body counts in the history of the medium. The cliche was lampooned in the set-up for one of the genre's most popular series, KonoSuba, in which the hero initially believes he died saving a beautiful girl from an oncoming truck, but is later told that the vehicle was actually a slow-moving tractor that the girl easily avoided, and that his actual cause of death was the stress caused by his overreaction to the situation. The joke has even spawned its own parody manga, Isekai Transporter, which casts the truck as a noble figure that heroically sends young people to be reincarnated into the worlds that need them most. RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai Many of the previously mentioned isekai anime series are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. Isekai Quartet, a crossover series featuring characters from many of the genre's most popular shows, will premiere a new movie in Japan on June 10.

In Tensai Ouji's Season 1 finale, a more monstrous side emerges.     By Diane Darcy Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt Episode 12, \"A Really Motivated Seller,\" now streaming on Funimation. The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide has long established that Prince Wein Salema Arbalest is no angel. With his first war alone, Wein demonstrated a lack of empathy for his own army when offering them empty words of encouragement, expecting them to lose the battle with Marden. When they actually won the war\u00a0-- not once, but twice -- he was genuinely stunned. In addition to having accidentally\u00a0helped dismantle an entire kingdom, Wein\u00a0was noticed by other neighboring kingdoms, including the Earthworld Empire. He even received a marriage proposal from Princess Lowellmina of Earthworld, who turned out to be his childhood friend \"Lowa.\"  In worse news for Wein, his defeat of Marden got him noticed by the more bigoted western kingdoms of Cavarin, Soljest and Delunio -- all of which subscribe to the Levetian religion with their monarchs being members of the Holy Elite. Delunio in particular owned land in Marden, putting Wein in an even bigger political bind. This caused the western kingdoms to conspire against him, looking\u00a0to control or even murder him. They were caught off guard, however, by Wein's impulsive murder of King Ordalasse of Cavarin. Now in Episode 12, the protagonist reveals an even more monstrous side in dealing with his biggest foes. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Wein Answers Lowa\u2019s Marriage Proposal Amid Chaos                  Wein\u00a0had been caught fraudulently exporting Earthworld goods as Natran products to the western kingdoms to subvert their refusal to trade with the empire. This action gets Princess Zenovia --\u00a0Marden's sole surviving monarch -- in trouble with the western kingdoms, which results in a threat from Delunio's prime minister, Sirgis. Wein takes responsibility for the exports and visits the kingdom of Soljest in order to form an alliance with King Gruyere. To Wein's surprise, he actually agrees to an alliance and shares his more liberal political views, which earns his trust. Unbeknown to Wein, however, King Gruyere's\u00a0plan was all a ruse to get him out of the way while he conspired with Prime Minister Sirgis behind the scenes to take back Marden's land, which led to Soljest invading Natra. After being played for a fool by Gruyere, Wein realized he had to act quickly to dissolve the alliance between Soljest and Delunio -- easier said than done. Careful planning of that dissolution would\u2019ve gone a lot smoother had Wein gone to Princess Lowa to work out the details, but\u00a0he didn't want to be indebted to the equally diabolical Lowa. Instead, he cooks up an even worse plan: to threaten genocide. Episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide\u00a0sees Wein and Zenovia pay a visit to Prime Minister Sirgis to try and work out a peaceful reconciliation. Zenovia attempts to appease Sirgis by offering double the land that is owed to Delunio in exchange for getting the Soljest army to stop their invasion of Natra. Sirgis, however, sees through\u00a0the proposal and doesn't accept her offer. With Zenovia\u2019s plan failing, Wein decides to take matters into his own hands by proposing that Sirgis murder King Gruyere before his kingdom grows to the point of deciding to invade Delunio. Sirgis once again isn't moved -- so Wein goes with Plan B. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Wein Gets Burnt By a Certain Princess - & It's Not Lowa                  Knowing that Soljest is too powerful for Natra's army to beat, Wein acknowledges Gruyere will succeed in seizing Natra, which will displace all of\u00a0its citizens. He also acknowledges his people will seek refuge in other kingdoms, including Delunio, which Sirgis accepts. After getting his \"approval,\" Wein gleefully tells Sirgis he will send all of his people as refugees to Delunio, which catches the prime minister off guard. Sirgis protests by saying\u00a0his nation can only accept a few hundred refugees, but any more\u00a0would exhaust Delunio's resources. Wein, however, has a solution to that too. To resolve the problem of overpopulation, Wein tricks Sirgis into thinking he\u2019s been secretly exporting a deadly poison to Delunio's citizens through their clothing. Over time, wearing these poisonous clothes will kill all of Delunio\u2019s citizens and the kingdom would be ripe for the picking for Natra\u2019s refugees. This plan proves too monstrous for Zenovia\u00a0who is immediately horrified by Wein's logic, even if he's suggesting genocide in jest. Sirgis, though, is in a worse position. While Sirgis does contemplate the possibility Wein is bluffing, at the same time he decides not to stake his political career by risking his own people's lives -- but then cracks under pressure and agrees to ally with Wein to stop Soljest's invasion of Natra. By acquiring Delunio's army, Natra's\u00a0own now has the support it needs to defeat Soljest and capture King Gruyere. This manages to impress Gruyere, who then awaits his own execution. Wein, however, offers him an alliance with Natra in exchange for learning the secret to Wein's genius. The prince's intelligence\u00a0shines through once again, but\u00a0in so doing has revealed an even darker side to\u00a0his character.

Wein takes responsibility for the exports and visits the kingdom of Soljest in order to form an alliance with King Gruyere. To Wein's surprise, he actually agrees to an alliance and shares his more liberal political views, which earns his trust. Unbeknown to Wein, however, King Gruyere's\u00a0plan was all a ruse to get him out of the way while he conspired with Prime Minister Sirgis behind the scenes to take back Marden's land, which led to Soljest invading Natra. After being played for a fool by Gruyere, Wein realized he had to act quickly to dissolve the alliance between Soljest and Delunio -- easier said than done. Careful planning of that dissolution would\u2019ve gone a lot smoother had Wein gone to Princess Lowa to work out the details, but\u00a0he didn't want to be indebted to the equally diabolical Lowa. Instead, he cooks up an even worse plan: to threaten genocide. Episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide\u00a0sees Wein and Zenovia pay a visit to Prime Minister Sirgis to try and work out a peaceful reconciliation. Zenovia attempts to appease Sirgis by offering double the land that is owed to Delunio in exchange for getting the Soljest army to stop their invasion of Natra. Sirgis, however, sees through\u00a0the proposal and doesn't accept her offer. With Zenovia\u2019s plan failing, Wein decides to take matters into his own hands by proposing that Sirgis murder King Gruyere before his kingdom grows to the point of deciding to invade Delunio. Sirgis once again isn't moved -- so Wein goes with Plan B. RELATED: The Genius Prince\u2019s Guide: Wein Gets Burnt By a Certain Princess - & It's Not Lowa                  Knowing that Soljest is too powerful for Natra's army to beat, Wein acknowledges Gruyere will succeed in seizing Natra, which will displace all of\u00a0its citizens. He also acknowledges his people will seek refuge in other kingdoms, including Delunio, which Sirgis accepts. After getting his \"approval,\" Wein gleefully tells Sirgis he will send all of his people as refugees to Delunio, which catches the prime minister off guard. Sirgis protests by saying\u00a0his nation can only accept a few hundred refugees, but any more\u00a0would exhaust Delunio's resources. Wein, however, has a solution to that too. To resolve the problem of overpopulation, Wein tricks Sirgis into thinking he\u2019s been secretly exporting a deadly poison to Delunio's citizens through their clothing. Over time, wearing these poisonous clothes will kill all of Delunio\u2019s citizens and the kingdom would be ripe for the picking for Natra\u2019s refugees. This plan proves too monstrous for Zenovia\u00a0who is immediately horrified by Wein's logic, even if he's suggesting genocide in jest. Sirgis, though, is in a worse position. While Sirgis does contemplate the possibility Wein is bluffing, at the same time he decides not to stake his political career by risking his own people's lives -- but then cracks under pressure and agrees to ally with Wein to stop Soljest's invasion of Natra. By acquiring Delunio's army, Natra's\u00a0own now has the support it needs to defeat Soljest and capture King Gruyere. This manages to impress Gruyere, who then awaits his own execution. Wein, however, offers him an alliance with Natra in exchange for learning the secret to Wein's genius. The prince's intelligence\u00a0shines through once again, but\u00a0in so doing has revealed an even darker side to\u00a0his character.

By Michael Lacerna Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A talented fan of\u00a0Akira has begun building a fully functional recreation of Shotaro Kaneda's distinctive motorcycle. The new project comes from Japanese YouTuber and motorcycle enthusiast Ayato. The builder, who is also known by their YouTube screenname Teruteru Boizu, began the project about\u00a0six months ago. The impressive replica began as an old junk bike, which the YouTuber stripped down to just its frame, engine and tires. Ayato then fabricated a new shell to recreate the look of Kaneda's ride, and built a custom suspension to ensure that bike looked and rode\u00a0like its anime and manga counterpart. The latest video shows how they added LED lighting to its wheels, recreating the futuristic glow of bike. While the replica is still incomplete and lacks\u00a0the motorcycle's distinct red paint and corporate branding, it is already a very impressive recreation of what may be the most famous bike in anime and manga history.  RELATED:\u00a0Absolutely Perfect Elden Ring/Akira Fan Art Hypes the Looming Release Date     The full video series of how Ayato built the bike can be viewed on their YouTube channel. Of course, this isn't the first time that Kaneda's bike has appeared in the real world: another Akira fan, Masashi Teshima, made\u00a0their own working replica of the motorcycle in 2012. Teshima's replica was so accurate that it was officially recognized by series creator Katsuhiro Otomo. Teshima rode the bike across Japan as part of a charity drive in order to raise money for a children's autism organization and later to help the victims of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Teshima's bike took significantly more time and money\u00a0to make than Ayato's newer project, however: that replica was built over the course of seven years and cost over $100,000 USD to create. RELATED:\u00a0Akira Fan Spots Animator's Hidden On-Screen Complaint Akira began as a manga by writer and artist Katsuhiro Otomo, which was first published in 1982. The manga was adapted into an anime movie in 1988, which Otomo directed himself. The manga was both a commercial and critical success, earning an\u00a0Eisner Award and the Kodansha Manga Award, while the anime adaptation is widely credited with helping to establish anime's international popularity with adult audiences in the early 1990s. The series is now widely regarded as not just one of the best anime and manga titles of the era, but as a landmark work in the cyberpunk genre. Otomo's original manga is now available in English from publisher Kodansha Comics. The movie is distributed in North America by Funimation, who recently re-released the film on 4K Blu-ray. A live-action adaptation has been in development for some time, with Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi attached to the project.

By Michael Lacerna Published 4 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A talented fan of\u00a0Akira has begun building a fully functional recreation of Shotaro Kaneda's distinctive motorcycle. The new project comes from Japanese YouTuber and motorcycle enthusiast Ayato. The builder, who is also known by their YouTube screenname Teruteru Boizu, began the project about\u00a0six months ago. The impressive replica began as an old junk bike, which the YouTuber stripped down to just its frame, engine and tires. Ayato then fabricated a new shell to recreate the look of Kaneda's ride, and built a custom suspension to ensure that bike looked and rode\u00a0like its anime and manga counterpart. The latest video shows how they added LED lighting to its wheels, recreating the futuristic glow of bike. While the replica is still incomplete and lacks\u00a0the motorcycle's distinct red paint and corporate branding, it is already a very impressive recreation of what may be the most famous bike in anime and manga history.  RELATED:\u00a0Absolutely Perfect Elden Ring/Akira Fan Art Hypes the Looming Release Date     The full video series of how Ayato built the bike can be viewed on their YouTube channel. Of course, this isn't the first time that Kaneda's bike has appeared in the real world: another Akira fan, Masashi Teshima, made\u00a0their own working replica of the motorcycle in 2012. Teshima's replica was so accurate that it was officially recognized by series creator Katsuhiro Otomo. Teshima rode the bike across Japan as part of a charity drive in order to raise money for a children's autism organization and later to help the victims of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Teshima's bike took significantly more time and money\u00a0to make than Ayato's newer project, however: that replica was built over the course of seven years and cost over $100,000 USD to create. RELATED:\u00a0Akira Fan Spots Animator's Hidden On-Screen Complaint Akira began as a manga by writer and artist Katsuhiro Otomo, which was first published in 1982. The manga was adapted into an anime movie in 1988, which Otomo directed himself. The manga was both a commercial and critical success, earning an\u00a0Eisner Award and the Kodansha Manga Award, while the anime adaptation is widely credited with helping to establish anime's international popularity with adult audiences in the early 1990s. The series is now widely regarded as not just one of the best anime and manga titles of the era, but as a landmark work in the cyberpunk genre. Otomo's original manga is now available in English from publisher Kodansha Comics. The movie is distributed in North America by Funimation, who recently re-released the film on 4K Blu-ray. A live-action adaptation has been in development for some time, with Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi attached to the project.

Here's why the comedy series Spy x Family is good.     By Marla A\u00f1onuevo Published Mar 26, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 season is coming, and one of the highly anticipated shows is Tatsuya Endo\u2019s action-comedy manga series, Spy x Family. It is under Shonen Jump, but the series steers away from elements usually found in many of the titles under this magazine. Spy x Family offers a refreshing new take on stories targeted for shonen. Numerous factors make the show appealing, but the premise will hook potential fans in immediately. Spy x Family revolves around the Forgers -- a pretend family with their own secret identities, which they are unaware of. A spy who goes by the name Twilight assumes the fatherly role of Loid Forger, a psychiatrist. Anya, the child, is a telepath. Meanwhile, the mother, Yor, is an assassin known as the Thorn Princess. Even though secrecy is a significant theme within the family (and the story), these members seem to be a perfect match for each other.  RELATED: Shonen Jump\u2019s Spy X Family: Plot, Characters & How to Get Started                  The story begins with Twilight, a master of disguise. He\u2019s a top agent of the Westalis\u2019 Intelligence Services\u2019 Eastern-Focused Division (WISE), an organization whose goal is to keep the peace between the countries Westalis and Ostania. Twilight's latest mission, Operation Strix, requires him to get married and have a family within a week. While it may seem like an impossible feat to obtain a wife and a child within mere days, he pulls through. He adopts Anya from an orphanage, and shortly after, he and Yor impulsively decide to get married while being chased by enemies. If that alone is not enticing enough, it gets better. Each member has their respective agenda and motivations for wanting to maintain\u00a0the fake family. Twilight needs this to get close to his target. Yor needs the sham marriage to keep her assassin gig and conform better to societal standards. Meanwhile, Anya thought it would be exciting to have a spy and an assassin as parents. Funnily enough, Anya is the only one who generally knows what's truly going on -- but of course, her understanding of it is limited since she's a young child. With that, there are instances where Anya acts accordingly for the sake of the mission. However, it almost always never goes smoothly. This usually results in some of the many hilarious moments in the story. RELATED:\u00a0Meet the Forgers in the Latest Spy x Family Anime Trailer                   Aside from the Forgers, Spy x Family has an equally interesting ensemble of supporting characters. Yor\u2019s younger brother, Yuri, works for the State Security Service (which is basically WISE\u2019s enemy). To keep with the theme of \u201csecrets\u201d in the story, Yor is unaware of Yuri\u2019s actual occupation and thinks he\u2019s a civil servant. He disapproves of Yor and Loid since he's incredibly attached to his sister. Henry Henderson, a teacher at Eden Academy, has a striking first impression. He embodies the word \"exaggeration\" in his character introduction, which is ironically funny considering how people at the prestigious Eden Academy are expected to be prim and proper. Considering some of the subject matter, certain aspects of Spy x Family might give off a serious tone -- but overall, the story is light and entertaining. A dysfunctional family involving a spy, an assassin, and a telepath\u00a0is pretty much a killer recipe for a chaotic dynamic. This may be fairly troublesome, especially knowing that world peace more or less lies within the hands of the Forgers. Their struggles as a group and how their secret identities affect the mission show us (in various ways) that maintaining and raising a family is indeed one of the world's most challenging tasks.

Here's why the comedy series Spy x Family is good.     By Marla A\u00f1onuevo Published Mar 26, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 season is coming, and one of the highly anticipated shows is Tatsuya Endo\u2019s action-comedy manga series, Spy x Family. It is under Shonen Jump, but the series steers away from elements usually found in many of the titles under this magazine. Spy x Family offers a refreshing new take on stories targeted for shonen. Numerous factors make the show appealing, but the premise will hook potential fans in immediately. Spy x Family revolves around the Forgers -- a pretend family with their own secret identities, which they are unaware of. A spy who goes by the name Twilight assumes the fatherly role of Loid Forger, a psychiatrist. Anya, the child, is a telepath. Meanwhile, the mother, Yor, is an assassin known as the Thorn Princess. Even though secrecy is a significant theme within the family (and the story), these members seem to be a perfect match for each other.  RELATED: Shonen Jump\u2019s Spy X Family: Plot, Characters & How to Get Started                  The story begins with Twilight, a master of disguise. He\u2019s a top agent of the Westalis\u2019 Intelligence Services\u2019 Eastern-Focused Division (WISE), an organization whose goal is to keep the peace between the countries Westalis and Ostania. Twilight's latest mission, Operation Strix, requires him to get married and have a family within a week. While it may seem like an impossible feat to obtain a wife and a child within mere days, he pulls through. He adopts Anya from an orphanage, and shortly after, he and Yor impulsively decide to get married while being chased by enemies. If that alone is not enticing enough, it gets better. Each member has their respective agenda and motivations for wanting to maintain\u00a0the fake family. Twilight needs this to get close to his target. Yor needs the sham marriage to keep her assassin gig and conform better to societal standards. Meanwhile, Anya thought it would be exciting to have a spy and an assassin as parents. Funnily enough, Anya is the only one who generally knows what's truly going on -- but of course, her understanding of it is limited since she's a young child. With that, there are instances where Anya acts accordingly for the sake of the mission. However, it almost always never goes smoothly. This usually results in some of the many hilarious moments in the story. RELATED:\u00a0Meet the Forgers in the Latest Spy x Family Anime Trailer                   Aside from the Forgers, Spy x Family has an equally interesting ensemble of supporting characters. Yor\u2019s younger brother, Yuri, works for the State Security Service (which is basically WISE\u2019s enemy). To keep with the theme of \u201csecrets\u201d in the story, Yor is unaware of Yuri\u2019s actual occupation and thinks he\u2019s a civil servant. He disapproves of Yor and Loid since he's incredibly attached to his sister. Henry Henderson, a teacher at Eden Academy, has a striking first impression. He embodies the word \"exaggeration\" in his character introduction, which is ironically funny considering how people at the prestigious Eden Academy are expected to be prim and proper. Considering some of the subject matter, certain aspects of Spy x Family might give off a serious tone -- but overall, the story is light and entertaining. A dysfunctional family involving a spy, an assassin, and a telepath\u00a0is pretty much a killer recipe for a chaotic dynamic. This may be fairly troublesome, especially knowing that world peace more or less lies within the hands of the Forgers. Their struggles as a group and how their secret identities affect the mission show us (in various ways) that maintaining and raising a family is indeed one of the world's most challenging tasks.

By Christian Markle Published 7 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Season 1 of Ranking of Kings, now streaming on Funimation. Ranking of Kings\u00a0has concluded its first season after airing 23 episodes. The anime follows the story of Prince Bojji, a weak and deaf prince who couldn't hurt a fly, as he gets entangled in the middle of a nasty power struggle following his father's death. The anime started strong by\u00a0throwing one plot twist after another and efficiently\u00a0expounding on its characters and their motivations, and the series proves that there\u00a0are\u00a0no completely bad or\u00a0absolutely good characters -- only characters\u00a0motivated by their personal goals.  The final episode of Season 1 elicited a variety of reactions from its viewers. The episode focuses on the redemption of the anime's main antagonist, Miranjo. With her ending up as Daida's soon-to-be wife, Bosse Kingdom's biggest threat has come to pass. However, the anime's first season also leaves a lot of questions. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: Bojji's First Big Battle Is Truly Heartwarming Where Are Bojji And Kage Headed Now?                  By defeating his father, Bojji saves his kingdom from peril. However, he remains the vanquished prince, as Prince Daida is still Bosse Kingdom's crowned king. The problem quickly solves itself when Daida voluntarily renounces the throne to its rightful owner. Witnessing Bojji's incredible fight against King Bosse easily convinces Bosse's strongest subordinates to submit to Bojji. Belonging to the Shadow Clan, Kage leaves Bojji, believing that he has no right to stay by the prince's side. Bojji relinquishes his crown, with Queen Hiling's support, and searches for his friend. When the beloved pair met, Bojji declares that he will start his own kingdom, just as\u00a0his father once did. With Bojji's strength, there is little that can pose a threat to them. However, power alone cannot build a kingdom. The two can follow in Bosse's footsteps and slowly build a following by helping others. With Bojji's pure heart, this is the most likely scenario. The other option is to go to the Underworld and start there. Bojji and Kage already have an established connection in the Underworld, and it's likely that they are already known by its denizens. They may find it easier to\u00a0recruit the citizens of the Underworld, especially since Bojji possesses near-unparalleled fighting prowess. RELATED: Blue Period Season 1's Biggest Unanswered Questions What Will Happen To Bosse Kingdom?                  Despite relinquishing the throne to Bojji, Daida is once again crowned as Bosse Kingdom's ruler when his brother decides to continue his adventures. This time, however, no more dangers are threatening the kingdom. Miranjo's troubled past and her problems have already been resolved, with Daida accepting her for who she is and taking her as his wife. Miranjo's cunning and intellect and Bosse's four trustworthy warriors remaining\u00a0in the kingdom\u00a0should\u00a0be able to defend it from most dangers. This raises the question of what will happen to the Bosse Kingdom next. Will it fade out of the series and live happily ever after -- or will it be attacked by the Gods once they learn of Miranjo's\u00a0situation, forcing Bojji to defend it? RELATED: Who Is Tokyo Revengers' Most Powerful Fighter & What Makes Him So Strong? What Is King Desha's Reward For Being The No. 1 King?                  The last episodes of\u00a0Ranking of Kings revealed that Desha and Despa planned to save their brother by asking the devil to relinquish his immortality. However, Daida sabotages that plan by asking for Miranjo's revival instead. When Despa reports this unforeseen turn of events to his brother, Desha is surprisingly nonchalant about it. The next scene then shows him accepting the rewards for being No. 1 in the Ranking of Kings. Desha accepting the reward right after hearing Despa's report hints that it may be a key to saving their brother Ouken. However, the anime has also disclosed that all previous kings who held that title somehow chose the same reward and have either gone mad or missing. The question now is this: what exactly is the reward and what is Desha planning to do with it?

By Marc York Published 2 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Hero Academia is really kicking into overdrive. The Heroes have engaged All For One and his legion of villains in what feels like the final battle of the series, and many of the Round One match-ups have been set: Endeavor vs AFO; Bakug\u014d vs Shigaraki; Todoroki vs Dabi. Deku has been sidetracked, but he's heading off to face Shigaraki, too. Meanwhile, Ochako Uraraka and Tsuyu Asui have been left to deal with Himiko Toga. Narratively, the latter fight\u00a0is already an interesting match-up,\u00a0but looking at it with the additional context of the\u00a0MHA\u00a0fandom makes it even more intriguing. In a way, this fight with Toga has already been shown and even animated. A few years ago, a certain fan animator created their own interpretation of how a fight between Tsuyu and Toga would play out.\u00a0Nothing definitively lines up between the animation and the manga. However, for where the manga is right now and where it seems to be headed, it very well could.\u00a0At this point, the potential similarities between the MHA\u00a0fan animation and the official manga are too\u00a0big to be ignored and almost too\u00a0many to be called mere coincidence. Here's an idea of how the fan animation and the manga might be connected and, if they are, where that could lead.  RELATED:\u00a0How My Hero Academia's Gran Torino Connects Directly to Star Wars An exercice i made using BNHA's characters to hopefully get better at drawing and animating.Sorry for the gifs quality. . . Part01 pic.twitter.com/kCKBpgmdyh\u2014 Chansard Vincent (@Sparkleredpanda) April 17, 2018     The story begins with one promising French animator. In April 2018, Chansard \"Sparkleredpanda\" Vincent put out his fan animation on Tumblr. It featured the Rainy Season Hero\u00a0engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the League of Villains resident yandere. The\u00a0fight is short,\u00a0less than 20 seconds, but it's fluid and nicely choreographed. The animation was well-received by\u00a0MHA\u00a0fans and quickly spread across the internet. The\u00a0potential for a reference starts with Chapter 345 of the official manga, \"Division.\" In this chapter, the villains are separated by the Heroes and warped to different battlefields with more Heroes ready and waiting to fight them. In an unforeseen turn of events, however, Toga snags Deku and pulls him to her designated battlefield, where she and several Nomus are slated to fight Uravity and Froppy. Having Froppy confront Toga could be taken as a sign of things to come. RELATED:\u00a0MHA Artist Shares Menacing New Dabi Portrait Of course, simply pitting Toga against Froppy isn't enough to draw parallels. In fact, for how things play out in Season 3 (which started around the same time Sparkleredpanda's animation was posted), it's almost to be expected. In order for these two instances of Froppy and Toga fighting to truly be connected, more\u00a0evidence needs to be presented. There are plenty of noteworthy things that could potentially tie these two fights together.\u00a0For one thing, while the fan animation came out in 2018, Horikoshi's version of this fight wouldn't begin until late February 2022. That four-year gap would be plenty of time for the MHA mangaka to catch wind of the fan animation and, potentially, draw inspiration from it.                  Another important thing that connects the two fights is the setting. Both the fan animation and the manga stage this confrontation on sunny days over calm, shallow water. If the manga fight had been set anywhere else, this whole comparison might have fallen apart. To be fair, there are some key differences between the two works. For one thing, the characters in the fan animation are wearing older outfits. Both of their costumes, especially Toga's, have undergone some notable changes and upgrades over the last four years. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia: Dabi's Inevitable Defeat Is Due to All For One's Carelessness There are also a lot more characters involved in this fight. Excluding Deku, who even narratively should never have been there, to begin with, some\u00a0Nomus, Ochako, and Gang Orca are also present on the scene. In truth, this fight is more about Ochako and Toga while Tsuyu is only there for backup. Finally, the fight as it's laid out in the fan animation hasn't technically happened in the manga. Only the potential for the fight exists right now. Froppy's biggest contribution to the battle has been kicking Toga away from Ochako. This isn't exactly anything as intimate as the drawn-out, close-quarters combat seen in the Sparkleredpanda's animation. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia Teases the Final One For All Quirk - and Toga's Revenge Despite the differences, however, the similarities are what should really be taken into account. Vincent's animation was never meant to be anything prophetic; according to him, it was intended as a test to practice certain animation techniques. Furthermore, the fan animation was only meant to focus on the fight between the two combatants. Thus, variations caused by changes in the actual story should be considered within the margin of error.\u00a0With that, said, there are still a few avenues to consider if the two fights are in fact connected. The first thing that comes to mind is how the anime would go about adapting such a fight scene. Even if Horikoshi doesn't include a direct fight sequence,\u00a0Bones might include one like it to fill the runtime of\u00a0an anime episode. Regardless of its significance to the overarching plot, it would still be cool to see this shout-out to such a passionate fan; the same could be said for the manga. Some rough layout/ichigen I did for BNHA109.#\u30d2\u30ed\u30a2\u30ab #\u30c8\u30ac\u30d2\u30df\u30b3 pic.twitter.com/uo35yAxEAD\u2014 Chansard Vincent (@Sparkleredpanda) August 28, 2021     Bones\u00a0could even invite Vincent on as a key animator if they really wanted to. He's had four years to refine his craft and has done work for the anime industry in the past. He's even gotten himself involved in big-name series like\u00a0Boruto\u00a0and\u00a0One Piece. He actually was supposed to do some animation for Episode 109, \"Revival Party,\" but his work was tragically left on the cutting room floor. Even if his envisioned fight never quite makes it into\u00a0MHA\u00a0canon, having him work on this scene would really bring things full circle. As for whether the similarities between the fan animation and the manga are intentional, that remains to be said. Unless an actual fight scene happens and it's unequivocally similar to the fan animation, only word from Horikoshi himself will confirm any inspiration. If\u00a0MHA\u00a0does, in fact, end up referencing this fan animation, it would be a cool way for Horikoshi to show\u00a0acknowledgment and appreciation for the efforts of his fans.

By Marc York Published 2 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Hero Academia is really kicking into overdrive. The Heroes have engaged All For One and his legion of villains in what feels like the final battle of the series, and many of the Round One match-ups have been set: Endeavor vs AFO; Bakug\u014d vs Shigaraki; Todoroki vs Dabi. Deku has been sidetracked, but he's heading off to face Shigaraki, too. Meanwhile, Ochako Uraraka and Tsuyu Asui have been left to deal with Himiko Toga. Narratively, the latter fight\u00a0is already an interesting match-up,\u00a0but looking at it with the additional context of the\u00a0MHA\u00a0fandom makes it even more intriguing. In a way, this fight with Toga has already been shown and even animated. A few years ago, a certain fan animator created their own interpretation of how a fight between Tsuyu and Toga would play out.\u00a0Nothing definitively lines up between the animation and the manga. However, for where the manga is right now and where it seems to be headed, it very well could.\u00a0At this point, the potential similarities between the MHA\u00a0fan animation and the official manga are too\u00a0big to be ignored and almost too\u00a0many to be called mere coincidence. Here's an idea of how the fan animation and the manga might be connected and, if they are, where that could lead.  RELATED:\u00a0How My Hero Academia's Gran Torino Connects Directly to Star Wars An exercice i made using BNHA's characters to hopefully get better at drawing and animating.Sorry for the gifs quality. . . Part01 pic.twitter.com/kCKBpgmdyh\u2014 Chansard Vincent (@Sparkleredpanda) April 17, 2018     The story begins with one promising French animator. In April 2018, Chansard \"Sparkleredpanda\" Vincent put out his fan animation on Tumblr. It featured the Rainy Season Hero\u00a0engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the League of Villains resident yandere. The\u00a0fight is short,\u00a0less than 20 seconds, but it's fluid and nicely choreographed. The animation was well-received by\u00a0MHA\u00a0fans and quickly spread across the internet. The\u00a0potential for a reference starts with Chapter 345 of the official manga, \"Division.\" In this chapter, the villains are separated by the Heroes and warped to different battlefields with more Heroes ready and waiting to fight them. In an unforeseen turn of events, however, Toga snags Deku and pulls him to her designated battlefield, where she and several Nomus are slated to fight Uravity and Froppy. Having Froppy confront Toga could be taken as a sign of things to come. RELATED:\u00a0MHA Artist Shares Menacing New Dabi Portrait Of course, simply pitting Toga against Froppy isn't enough to draw parallels. In fact, for how things play out in Season 3 (which started around the same time Sparkleredpanda's animation was posted), it's almost to be expected. In order for these two instances of Froppy and Toga fighting to truly be connected, more\u00a0evidence needs to be presented. There are plenty of noteworthy things that could potentially tie these two fights together.\u00a0For one thing, while the fan animation came out in 2018, Horikoshi's version of this fight wouldn't begin until late February 2022. That four-year gap would be plenty of time for the MHA mangaka to catch wind of the fan animation and, potentially, draw inspiration from it.                  Another important thing that connects the two fights is the setting. Both the fan animation and the manga stage this confrontation on sunny days over calm, shallow water. If the manga fight had been set anywhere else, this whole comparison might have fallen apart. To be fair, there are some key differences between the two works. For one thing, the characters in the fan animation are wearing older outfits. Both of their costumes, especially Toga's, have undergone some notable changes and upgrades over the last four years. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia: Dabi's Inevitable Defeat Is Due to All For One's Carelessness There are also a lot more characters involved in this fight. Excluding Deku, who even narratively should never have been there, to begin with, some\u00a0Nomus, Ochako, and Gang Orca are also present on the scene. In truth, this fight is more about Ochako and Toga while Tsuyu is only there for backup. Finally, the fight as it's laid out in the fan animation hasn't technically happened in the manga. Only the potential for the fight exists right now. Froppy's biggest contribution to the battle has been kicking Toga away from Ochako. This isn't exactly anything as intimate as the drawn-out, close-quarters combat seen in the Sparkleredpanda's animation. RELATED:\u00a0My Hero Academia Teases the Final One For All Quirk - and Toga's Revenge Despite the differences, however, the similarities are what should really be taken into account. Vincent's animation was never meant to be anything prophetic; according to him, it was intended as a test to practice certain animation techniques. Furthermore, the fan animation was only meant to focus on the fight between the two combatants. Thus, variations caused by changes in the actual story should be considered within the margin of error.\u00a0With that, said, there are still a few avenues to consider if the two fights are in fact connected. The first thing that comes to mind is how the anime would go about adapting such a fight scene. Even if Horikoshi doesn't include a direct fight sequence,\u00a0Bones might include one like it to fill the runtime of\u00a0an anime episode. Regardless of its significance to the overarching plot, it would still be cool to see this shout-out to such a passionate fan; the same could be said for the manga.

He's had four years to refine his craft and has done work for the anime industry in the past. He's even gotten himself involved in big-name series like\u00a0Boruto\u00a0and\u00a0One Piece. He actually was supposed to do some animation for Episode 109, \"Revival Party,\" but his work was tragically left on the cutting room floor. Even if his envisioned fight never quite makes it into\u00a0MHA\u00a0canon, having him work on this scene would really bring things full circle. As for whether the similarities between the fan animation and the manga are intentional, that remains to be said. Unless an actual fight scene happens and it's unequivocally similar to the fan animation, only word from Horikoshi himself will confirm any inspiration. If\u00a0MHA\u00a0does, in fact, end up referencing this fan animation, it would be a cool way for Horikoshi to show\u00a0acknowledgment and appreciation for the efforts of his fans.
