Chef's Kiss   Writer  Jarrett Melendez    Artist  Danica Brine    Letterer  Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou    Publisher  Oni Press    Price  14.99    Release Date  2022-04-12    Colorist  Hank Jones      So often, coming-of-age stories focus on teens, ignoring the fact that people never stop growing and taking on new roles and responsibilities. When a graphic novel does dare to explore what it's like to go through major periods of change as an adult, it is a breath of fresh air, and that is exactly what Chef's Kiss is. Written by Jarrett Melendez, art by Danica Brine, colors by Hank Jones, and letters by Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, Chef's Kiss is about Ben Cook, a recent college graduate struggling to find work in his field of study. He decides to apply for a job at a restaurant, where he not only learns more about himself but also develops feelings for one of the chefs working there, Liam.  While the title of the graphic novel makes it seem like this is primarily a romance story, Chef's Kiss actually puts focus on Ben's personal growth first and foremost. For those wanting a hot and heavy love story that dominates the book, Chef's Kiss may disappoint; however, the graphic novel is a sweet, slow burn. More importantly, it's a story about self-love and discovery, with Ben going on a transformative journey that asks a question most 20-somethings wonder: what do I actually want? RELATED: Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing                Many people are taught that they are supposed to know exactly what they want in life as teens. They are often told that if they follow a specific path perfectly, they will then achieve this goal. However, Chef's Kiss shows that those goals and wants change over time, and even when people do everything right, they may not see the promised results. Chef's Kiss beautifully demonstrates the hard truths of becoming an adult, but it does so in a way that is still hopeful. For those just entering this stage of life, it prepares them for what actually lies ahead. Meanwhile, for those who have moved beyond it or who are still going through it, Chef's Kiss validates this frustrating, stressful, and exciting period of life.  Chef's Kiss also pays attention to the other relationships in one's life beyond the romantic ones. Parental, platonic, and work relationships all get their time to be fleshed out, with the platonic ones particularly reminding readers that all relationships go through hardships and need to be worked on to become stronger. The fact these relationships feel so real is a testament to the characters themselves, as they feel developed with room to grow. The romantic relationship is cute and captures what it feels like to have a crush on someone. Chef's Kiss isn't afraid to show some of the embarrassing and confusing moments that come with a crush.  RELATED: Cities of Magick #1 Comic Review At the end of the day, Chef's Kiss reads as sweet, especially given the art style. Brine finds a great balance between the realistic and the cartoonish, letting the characters' expressions speak for themselves. The anatomy, in particular, is a stand-out as it feels realistic while also capturing what these two cooks find attractive in one another. It would also be a shame not to discuss the food in Chef's Kiss, as Melendez puts great care into these recipes. How he writes about food makes one want to try the dishes themselves, especially after seeing how Brine illustrates them. They look delicious and like something one could actually order for themselves at a quaint restaurant. Thankfully, the back of Chef's Kiss includes a few of those recipes for readers to try out themselves.  While not a spicy romance, Chef's Kiss is certainly sweet with lots of heart. It goes beyond being a love story, delivering a message so many readers need to hear. That, accompanied by a cast of characters forming a beautiful found family, makes Chef's Kiss a great comic to read with a warm cup of tea and fresh pear tartlet.

Chef's Kiss   Writer  Jarrett Melendez    Artist  Danica Brine    Letterer  Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou    Publisher  Oni Press    Price  14.99    Release Date  2022-04-12    Colorist  Hank Jones      So often, coming-of-age stories focus on teens, ignoring the fact that people never stop growing and taking on new roles and responsibilities. When a graphic novel does dare to explore what it's like to go through major periods of change as an adult, it is a breath of fresh air, and that is exactly what Chef's Kiss is. Written by Jarrett Melendez, art by Danica Brine, colors by Hank Jones, and letters by Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, Chef's Kiss is about Ben Cook, a recent college graduate struggling to find work in his field of study. He decides to apply for a job at a restaurant, where he not only learns more about himself but also develops feelings for one of the chefs working there, Liam.  While the title of the graphic novel makes it seem like this is primarily a romance story, Chef's Kiss actually puts focus on Ben's personal growth first and foremost. For those wanting a hot and heavy love story that dominates the book, Chef's Kiss may disappoint; however, the graphic novel is a sweet, slow burn. More importantly, it's a story about self-love and discovery, with Ben going on a transformative journey that asks a question most 20-somethings wonder: what do I actually want? RELATED: Sakamoto Days Feels Like It Comes From the '90s - and That's a Good Thing                Many people are taught that they are supposed to know exactly what they want in life as teens.

However, Chef's Kiss shows that those goals and wants change over time, and even when people do everything right, they may not see the promised results.

The following article contains spoilers for Tiger & Bunny 2, Episode 3, \"Suspicion Will Raise Bogies,\" now streaming on Netflix.   After spending its first episode re-acclimating viewers with the titular duo and its second on establishing one of the new heroes, Tiger & Bunny 2's third episode shines the spotlight on one of the series' original First Leaguers, the ice-themed Blue Rose.  In this episode, Blue Rose asks Kotetsu -- who she is still shown to be smitten with -- to join her in visiting a sick fan, Nadia. Kotetsu agrees, which leads to a subplot in which Blue Rose's partner Golden Ryan believes she's trying to replace him with Kotetsu. RELATED: Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure Live-Action Spinoff Is Now Streaming                However, when Kotetsu and Blue Rose get to the restaurant, they're greeted by a very unwelcome face -- it turns out that Nadia was in fact a ruse by a villainous NEXT from the first season: Lionel Hawke, a stalkerish fan hyper-fixated on Blue Rose. It's easy to forget that Lionel existed in the first place. After all, he was a one-off gag villain, arrested and seemingly dealt with for good in the first season's 14th episode. His return here may seem like an odd choice, but if there's anything that can be gleaned from it, it's the fact that Tiger & Bunny 2 isn't afraid to call back to the first season, even in the most esoteric of ways.  RELATED: Spy x Family's Premiere Introduces the World's Most Adorably Awkward Father-Daughter Duo After all, there was an 11-year gap between seasons. Since then, there's been a proliferation of hugely successful superhero anime, including My Hero Academia and One-Punch Man. It would have been incredibly easy for Tiger & Bunny 2 to cash in on this, serving as a soft reboot with no major continuity nods to the first season so as not to alienate new viewers. However, these first three episodes have gone out of their way to demonstrate that the ''2'' in the title isn't just for show. Whether it's the continuation of the first season's Ouroboros plotline, the inclusion of a relatively obscure movie character in Golden Ryan or the reappearance of a one-off gag character like Lionel, Tiger & Bunny 2 is keen to let viewers know that it's a sequel in the truest sense.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man Creator\u2019s New Manga, Goodbye, Eri, Now Available in English                Nonetheless, the episode also makes clear that Tiger & Bunny 2 isn't just set to wallow in nostalgia -- it has its eyes set on the future as well -- and not just with another appearance of Fugan and Mugan, the mysterious white-haired duo who are due to clash with Barnaby later in the series, but also with the establishment of another antagonist. In the episode's final scene, a mysterious red-haired man in a lab coat picks up a Barnaby trading card, vowing to beat the bespectacled hero. It's an ominous note to end on, as well as a reminder that the humorous, comfortable tone of the opening episodes can't last forever.

Kotetsu agrees, which leads to a subplot in which Blue Rose's partner Golden Ryan believes she's trying to replace him with Kotetsu.

It's easy to forget that Lionel existed in the first place. After all, he was a one-off gag villain, arrested and seemingly dealt with for good in the first season's 14th episode. His return here may seem like an odd choice, but if there's anything that can be gleaned from it, it's the fact that Tiger & Bunny 2 isn't afraid to call back to the first season, even in the most esoteric of ways.  RELATED: Spy x Family's Premiere Introduces the World's Most Adorably Awkward Father-Daughter Duo After all, there was an 11-year gap between seasons. Since then, there's been a proliferation of hugely successful superhero anime, including My Hero Academia and One-Punch Man. It would have been incredibly easy for Tiger & Bunny 2 to cash in on this, serving as a soft reboot with no major continuity nods to the first season so as not to alienate new viewers. However, these first three episodes have gone out of their way to demonstrate that the ''2'' in the title isn't just for show. Whether it's the continuation of the first season's Ouroboros plotline, the inclusion of a relatively obscure movie character in Golden Ryan or the reappearance of a one-off gag character like Lionel, Tiger & Bunny 2 is keen to let viewers know that it's a sequel in the truest sense.  RELATED: Chainsaw Man Creator\u2019s New Manga, Goodbye, Eri, Now Available in English                Nonetheless, the episode also makes clear that Tiger & Bunny 2 isn't just set to wallow in nostalgia -- it has its eyes set on the future as well -- and not just with another appearance of Fugan and Mugan, the mysterious white-haired duo who are due to clash with Barnaby later in the series, but also with the establishment of another antagonist. In the episode's final scene, a mysterious red-haired man in a lab coat picks up a Barnaby trading card, vowing to beat the bespectacled hero. It's an ominous note to end on, as well as a reminder that the humorous, comfortable tone of the opening episodes can't last forever.

The following contains major spoilers for Human Target #5, on sale now from DC Comics.   Scandal is nothing new to the world of superheroes. In both Marvel and DC Comics, there have been tons of controversial, shocking, and taboo moments. In that vein, the most recent revelation to come out of the ongoing Human Target miniseries just brought to light several bombshells.The series so far has followed Christopher Chance as he investigates a murder attempt on Lex Luthor. The clues have led Chance to conclude that it was a member of the classic Justice League International team that made the attempt on Luthor's life.  Over the course of several issues, Chance and his new partner/love interest, Ice (also formerly of the JLI) have been interviewing several of Ice's former teammates, including Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, and Green Lantern Guy Gardner (who also happens to be Ice's ex). In Human Target #5 (by Tom King, Greg Smallwood, and Clayton Cowles) the duo start to uncover more than just a potential murder plot. While engaged in a mental \"interrogation\" with J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter, Chance is able to probe the famed Martian hero's memories. What he discovers is something that was not only previously unknown but dramatically recontextualizes the relationships between the members of the JLI: the Manhunter has been having a secret affair with his teammate Beatriz De Costa, aka Fire.  RELATED:Tom King Discusses Where - Or If - Human Target Fits in DCU Continuity                 It's unknown just how long this affair has been going on, but it is entirely possible that it was happening at the time that both members served together in the League. From the context given, it seems that they kept this affair a secret from their fellow teammates, begging the question of why they chose to do so. From what is seen in the issue, the entanglement between the two heroes seems to be one that pushes certain limitations. After all, J'onn's greatest weakness is the element of fire. Maybe because of this, both of them realized that this is a relationship that cannot last, at least not in the long term. At the same time, however, the very fact that J'onn is willing to carry on this affair in spite of his vulnerability may speak to the depth of his attraction to Beatriz. He is literally willing to put himself in potential danger just to be with her.  RELATED: DC Just Revealed How Easy It Is to Kill a Green Lantern                 It is worth noting though, that this is not J'onn's only \"fiery\" romance. During the events of the \"Trial by FIre\" story arc during Joe Kelly's run on JLA, J'onn became romantically linked with the villainess Scorch who, like Beatriz, possessed pyrokinetic abilities. In fact, this is part of the reason why J'onn sought Scorch out in the first place: he wanted her help in overcoming his weakness to fire. Perhaps this is how his relationship with Bea started as well. Regardless of why they chose to keep their relationship a secret, what's more shocking is what J'onn might have actually helped Beatriz do.

The following contains major spoilers for Human Target #5, on sale now from DC Comics.   Scandal is nothing new to the world of superheroes. In both Marvel and DC Comics, there have been tons of controversial, shocking, and taboo moments. In that vein, the most recent revelation to come out of the ongoing Human Target miniseries just brought to light several bombshells.The series so far has followed Christopher Chance as he investigates a murder attempt on Lex Luthor. The clues have led Chance to conclude that it was a member of the classic Justice League International team that made the attempt on Luthor's life.  Over the course of several issues, Chance and his new partner/love interest, Ice (also formerly of the JLI) have been interviewing several of Ice's former teammates, including Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, and Green Lantern Guy Gardner (who also happens to be Ice's ex). In Human Target #5 (by Tom King, Greg Smallwood, and Clayton Cowles) the duo start to uncover more than just a potential murder plot. While engaged in a mental \"interrogation\" with J'onn J'onzz, the Martian Manhunter, Chance is able to probe the famed Martian hero's memories. What he discovers is something that was not only previously unknown but dramatically recontextualizes the relationships between the members of the JLI: the Manhunter has been having a secret affair with his teammate Beatriz De Costa, aka Fire.  RELATED:Tom King Discusses Where - Or If - Human Target Fits in DCU Continuity                 It's unknown just how long this affair has been going on, but it is entirely possible that it was happening at the time that both members served together in the League. From the context given, it seems that they kept this affair a secret from their fellow teammates, begging the question of why they chose to do so. From what is seen in the issue, the entanglement between the two heroes seems to be one that pushes certain limitations. After all, J'onn's greatest weakness is the element of fire. Maybe because of this, both of them realized that this is a relationship that cannot last, at least not in the long term. At the same time, however, the very fact that J'onn is willing to carry on this affair in spite of his vulnerability may speak to the depth of his attraction to Beatriz. He is literally willing to put himself in potential danger just to be with her.  RELATED: DC Just Revealed How Easy It Is to Kill a Green Lantern                 It is worth noting though, that this is not J'onn's only \"fiery\" romance. During the events of the \"Trial by FIre\" story arc during Joe Kelly's run on JLA, J'onn became romantically linked with the villainess Scorch who, like Beatriz, possessed pyrokinetic abilities. In fact, this is part of the reason why J'onn sought Scorch out in the first place: he wanted her help in overcoming his weakness to fire. Perhaps this is how his relationship with Bea started as well. Regardless of why they chose to keep their relationship a secret, what's more shocking is what J'onn might have actually helped Beatriz do. The issue ends with the implication that Fire was the one who made the attempt on Luthor's life, as revenge for his part in her best friend Ice's (albeit temporary) death, and the Manhunter may have unwittingly provided her with the resources she needed to commit the act.

By Marc York Published 14 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The longest-running anime series is one most American viewers have never heard of, despite airing for more than five decades and 7,800 episodes.                 When talking about the longest-running anime, a lot of fans might assume it's a series like One Piece or Pok\u00e9mon. After all, each of them boasts more than 1,000 episodes, which puts even The Simpsons to shame. However, a far lesser-known anime holds the title; in fact, it's not even close.  The longest-running anime is actually Sazae-san, which has likely escaped the attention of most North American fans, despite the series airing for more than five decades, and counting. RELATED: One Piece: How Wild Can Luffy Get With His New Powers?          The Longest-Running Anime Series Is Sazae-san                Sazae-san began in April 1946 as a four-panel comic strip (yonkoma) by pioneering female mangaka Machiko Hasegawa. It debuted in her local newspaper, Fukunichi Shinbun, before being picked up three years later by Asahi Shinbun, where it continued to until 1974. The yonkoma ran for about 6,500 strips. The series was adapted as an anime series beginning in 1969, and has been running on Japanese television ever since. The anime airs three eight-minute episodes each week, which contributes to its staggering episode count. Currently, Sazae-san clocks in at a whopping 7,881 episodes, but that number continues to increase.  Not only is Sazae-san the longest-running anime, but it's also the longest-running animated series of all time. Period. That's an accomplishment acknowledged in 2013 by Guinness World Records. It's an achievement that scripted television probably won't surpass any time soon. RELATED: Honeyworks: How to Get Started on the Music-Based Franchise          What Is Sazae-san About?                Sazae-san follows the daily life of Sazae Fugata, a mid-twenties homemaker, and her loving family: her husband, her parents, her son, her younger siblings and a pet cat. Sazae-san was meant to embody what Hasegawa-sensei hoped the traditional Japanese family become following World War II. To that end, Sazae herself was more interested in horseback riding than doing what was expected for women of the era to attract a husband. When she finally did get married, she tended to boss her husband around, which the neighbors found as unorthodox.  Sazae-san is also known for never aging its characters; even as years go by in the series, the characters remain unchanged. Other animated series do this, too, but for as long as Sazae-san has been on the air, it's a little more noticeable. The trope, the logic and the anime are all often referenced in Gintama to explain why its own characters never age under similar circumstances. Sazae-san is a simple slice-of-life comedy, but its depiction of Japanese life from its time period has triggered nostalgia, and garnered praise, from Japanese audiences. It represents an antiquated-yet-progressive viewpoint from a bygone era, before the social changes brought about by modern technology. As such, it has remained a high-rated program.  RELATED: What Are Yokai \u2013 and the Most Famous Anime That Feature Them          What Is the Second-Longest Running Anime?                The second-longest running anime is Nintama Rantar\u014d. Airing since 1993, the series boasts an impressive 2,321 episodes, and counting. That is also leagues ahead of One Piece and Pok\u00e9mon, but far behind Sazae-san's nigh-insurmountable 7,881 episodes. The series follows the daily lives of Rantar\u014d and his classmates as they learn to become ninjas. If Naruto had put more focus on the titular character's Ninja Academy days, it might have looked something like this. Of course, Nintama Rantar\u014d is aimed at little kids, so the series will never go as dark as Naruto does.

What Is the Longest-Running Anime Series?  By Marc York Published 14 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   The longest-running anime series is one most American viewers have never heard of, despite airing for more than five decades and 7,800 episodes.                 When talking about the longest-running anime, a lot of fans might assume it's a series like One Piece or Pok\u00e9mon. After all, each of them boasts more than 1,000 episodes, which puts even The Simpsons to shame. However, a far lesser-known anime holds the title; in fact, it's not even close.  The longest-running anime is actually Sazae-san, which has likely escaped the attention of most North American fans, despite the series airing for more than five decades, and counting. RELATED: One Piece: How Wild Can Luffy Get With His New Powers?          The Longest-Running Anime Series Is Sazae-san                Sazae-san began in April 1946 as a four-panel comic strip (yonkoma) by pioneering female mangaka Machiko Hasegawa. It debuted in her local newspaper, Fukunichi Shinbun, before being picked up three years later by Asahi Shinbun, where it continued to until 1974. The yonkoma ran for about 6,500 strips. The series was adapted as an anime series beginning in 1969, and has been running on Japanese television ever since. The anime airs three eight-minute episodes each week, which contributes to its staggering episode count. Currently, Sazae-san clocks in at a whopping 7,881 episodes, but that number continues to increase.  Not only is Sazae-san the longest-running anime, but it's also the longest-running animated series of all time. Period. That's an accomplishment acknowledged in 2013 by Guinness World Records. It's an achievement that scripted television probably won't surpass any time soon. RELATED: Honeyworks: How to Get Started on the Music-Based Franchise          What Is Sazae-san About?                Sazae-san follows the daily life of Sazae Fugata, a mid-twenties homemaker, and her loving family: her husband, her parents, her son, her younger siblings and a pet cat. Sazae-san was meant to embody what Hasegawa-sensei hoped the traditional Japanese family become following World War II. To that end, Sazae herself was more interested in horseback riding than doing what was expected for women of the era to attract a husband. When she finally did get married, she tended to boss her husband around, which the neighbors found as unorthodox.  Sazae-san is also known for never aging its characters; even as years go by in the series, the characters remain unchanged. Other animated series do this, too, but for as long as Sazae-san has been on the air, it's a little more noticeable. The trope, the logic and the anime are all often referenced in Gintama to explain why its own characters never age under similar circumstances. Sazae-san is a simple slice-of-life comedy, but its depiction of Japanese life from its time period has triggered nostalgia, and garnered praise, from Japanese audiences. It represents an antiquated-yet-progressive viewpoint from a bygone era, before the social changes brought about by modern technology. As such, it has remained a high-rated program.  RELATED: What Are Yokai \u2013 and the Most Famous Anime That Feature Them          What Is the Second-Longest Running Anime?                The second-longest running anime is Nintama Rantar\u014d. Airing since 1993, the series boasts an impressive 2,321 episodes, and counting. That is also leagues ahead of One Piece and Pok\u00e9mon, but far behind Sazae-san's nigh-insurmountable 7,881 episodes. The series follows the daily lives of Rantar\u014d and his classmates as they learn to become ninjas. If Naruto had put more focus on the titular character's Ninja Academy days, it might have looked something like this. Of course, Nintama Rantar\u014d is aimed at little kids, so the series will never go as dark as Naruto does.

Home Anime Bakuman Is a Great Anime With Problematic Characterization    Bakuman Is a Great Anime With Problematic Characterization  By Gregory Segal Published 20 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   While Bakuman offers an in-depth look into the world of mangaka, its female characters, Azuki and Kaya, are reduced to a series of frustrating tropes.                 Bakuman, written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from August 2008 to April 2012. The series would later be adapted into a 75-episode anime which has garnered both commercial and critical success.  The series has certainly been deserving of the adoration it has received, with its accurate portrayal of what it\u2019s like to work in the manga industry to a plethora of well-written characters and storylines. However, over the years many people have noticed the problematic characterization of Bakuman\u2019s female leads, Azuki and Kaya. RELATED: Spy x Family: Twilight's Backstory Reveals His Complicated Relationship With His Father                This isn\u2019t the first time that this mangaka team has been criticized for their poor construction of female characters. From the sexualization of Death Note\u2019s Misa Amane to the absence of a real identity for Saki Hanakago in Platinum End, Ohba and Obata seemingly lack the skills to create female characters that impact their stories or have enough identifiable traits to make them relatable.  In Bakuman, Azuki and Kaya are no exception. While these characters possess their own dreams and values, they are rarely developed upon and are instead used in tandem with the goals of the series\u2019 male protagonists to advance the narrative. Although it would be unfair to expect each and every character within the show to have an equal level of progression, for such important characters it seems strange that they have simply been reduced to a bundle of tropes and plot devices, with little agency or complexity. RELATED:I\u2019m Quitting Heroing Shows What Happens After the Final Boss Battle                  The main purpose for the existence of Bakuman\u2019s female characters is to create a romantic storyline for Mashiro and Takagi. After Mashiro falls head over heels for Azuki, the couple promises that they will not get married (and even limit their interactions to texting) until they have achieved their dream of Mashiro\u2019s manga being adapted into an anime that stars Azuki as its female lead. While certainly a little strange, there is nothing inherently wrong with this in itself. However, what becomes difficult to understand is why Azuki\u2019s entire life direction, personality, and impact on the story revolve around her love interest. Although a degree of influence can be expected to come from such a Romeo and Juliet-styled infatuation, Azuki\u2019s lack of agency is completely nonsensical and diminishes the authenticity of what is often a slice-of-life story.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Is Kid Trunks & Mai's Bond Harmless or Problematic?                 The characterization of Kaya is equally flawed. Despite having a fierce independent streak and fiery temperament, Kaya is cheapened to serving Takagi\u2019s every need even though he rarely pays her any attention. She is often portrayed as an obstacle for Takagi and his work, whether it\u2019s requesting him to take time off to go out on a date or for him to help her with writing online fiction. She is more of a nuisance to Takagi than a partner. While this might have served as an excellent opportunity to comment on the difficulties of work-life balance in Japan or provide an acute examination of the traditional housewife, Ohba instead offers a rather two-dimensional perspective. The audience is left with a half-baked and one-sided relationship that is seemingly meant to inspire, yet more readily depresses, as Kaya is reduced to carrying out menial tasks and shadows her husband's every move.  RELATED:Why Chainsaw Man\u2019s Latest Chapter is For Adult Readers Only                 For a series that contains as much attention to detail as Bakuman does, it\u2019s rather baffling that more time couldn\u2019t be spent on developing its female characters. As an audience, we\u2019re supposed to root for these characters to succeed and for their relationships to blossom. Unfortunately, this is very difficult to do since both Azuki and Kaya bear little-to-no personalities and are stuck in what can largely be regarded as toxic relationships. The characterizations of Azuki and Kaya are so out of place, that some fans have speculated that instead of complacency on behalf of the writer, the inclusion of tropes and static personalities is a form of meta-commentary on the traditional portrayal of women in shonen manga. The reason for Azuki, Kaya, and other female characters' representation as prizes for male characters or general mood dampeners is a way to express the array of traditional archetypes that often appear in this medium. Consequently, Bakuman\u2019s use of these oversimplified and stilted characterizations could possibly be viewed as a form of commentary and criticism.  Whether this is or isn\u2019t the case certainly remains to be seen. However, regardless of this theory, Azuki and Kaya are horribly under-written characters and are arguably the weakest element within the series. If were intended as a method of criticism or parody on shonen tropes, then there surely would have been better ways to incorporate this, without diminishing the series\u2019 plot or ability to create relatable and exciting female characters.

Bakuman, written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump from August 2008 to April 2012. The series would later be adapted into a 75-episode anime which has garnered both commercial and critical success.  The series has certainly been deserving of the adoration it has received, with its accurate portrayal of what it\u2019s like to work in the manga industry to a plethora of well-written characters and storylines. However, over the years many people have noticed the problematic characterization of Bakuman\u2019s female leads, Azuki and Kaya. RELATED: Spy x Family: Twilight's Backstory Reveals His Complicated Relationship With His Father                This isn\u2019t the first time that this mangaka team has been criticized for their poor construction of female characters. From the sexualization of Death Note\u2019s Misa Amane to the absence of a real identity for Saki Hanakago in Platinum End, Ohba and Obata seemingly lack the skills to create female characters that impact their stories or have enough identifiable traits to make them relatable.  In Bakuman, Azuki and Kaya are no exception. While these characters possess their own dreams and values, they are rarely developed upon and are instead used in tandem with the goals of the series\u2019 male protagonists to advance the narrative. Although it would be unfair to expect each and every character within the show to have an equal level of progression, for such important characters it seems strange that they have simply been reduced to a bundle of tropes and plot devices, with little agency or complexity. RELATED:I\u2019m Quitting Heroing Shows What Happens After the Final Boss Battle                  The main purpose for the existence of Bakuman\u2019s female characters is to create a romantic storyline for Mashiro and Takagi. After Mashiro falls head over heels for Azuki, the couple promises that they will not get married (and even limit their interactions to texting) until they have achieved their dream of Mashiro\u2019s manga being adapted into an anime that stars Azuki as its female lead. While certainly a little strange, there is nothing inherently wrong with this in itself. However, what becomes difficult to understand is why Azuki\u2019s entire life direction, personality, and impact on the story revolve around her love interest. Although a degree of influence can be expected to come from such a Romeo and Juliet-styled infatuation, Azuki\u2019s lack of agency is completely nonsensical and diminishes the authenticity of what is often a slice-of-life story.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Super: Is Kid Trunks & Mai's Bond Harmless or Problematic?                 The characterization of Kaya is equally flawed. Despite having a fierce independent streak and fiery temperament, Kaya is cheapened to serving Takagi\u2019s every need even though he rarely pays her any attention. She is often portrayed as an obstacle for Takagi and his work, whether it\u2019s requesting him to take time off to go out on a date or for him to help her with writing online fiction. She is more of a nuisance to Takagi than a partner. While this might have served as an excellent opportunity to comment on the difficulties of work-life balance in Japan or provide an acute examination of the traditional housewife, Ohba instead offers a rather two-dimensional perspective.

The producers behind the Mob Psycho 100 anime teased a new announcement related to the series.  The official Twitter account for the acclaimed action-comedy series tweeted out a message in both English and Japanese that states \"Did you know May 12th is MOB's birthday? You might want to make a note of that date...\" The teaser was accompanied with an image of Mob holding a flower. RELATED: Mob Psycho 100 Season 3 Teases a Bigger Role for Ritsu      The announcement is expected to be related to the third season of the series' anime adaptation, which was confirmed to be in production last October. The third season is being produced by BONES, the studio behind the first two seasons of the show and numerous other hit anime, including Eureka Seven and Ouran High School Host Club. The new season will be co-directed by Takahiro Hasui, who previously worked as an episode director on Sk8 the Infinity, and Yuzuru Tachikawa, who directed the previous two seasons of the show. The voice cast, which includes Setsuo Ito as Mob and Food Wars: Shougeki No Shoma's Takahiro Sakurai as Reigen, are all expected to reprise their roles. A premiere date for the third season has yet to be announced.  Mob Psycho 100 tells the story of Shigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama, a seemingly normal and somewhat forgettable middle school student who is in actuality one of the world's most powerful espers. In order to keep his immense psychic powers under control, Mob is forced to carefully maintain his composure and avoid any strong feelings or emotions, which hinders his ability to live a normal life. Things change when he meets Reigen Arataka, a con-man who promotes himself as an exorcist, who gives Mob a job and promises to help him learn how to control his abilities. RELATED: Mob Psycho 100: Shigeo's True Power Is Bringing Out the Best in People  The anime is based on a manga that was written and drawn by ONE, the author who also created One-Punch Man. The series premiered in 2012 in Shogakukan's Ura Sunday magazine, where it was serialized until it concluded in late 2017. ONE followed up the manga with a spinoff, Reigen, which was serialized from 2018 \u2013 2019. Both the original Mob Psycho 100 and its spinoff are localized and distributed in English by Dark Horse Comics. The first two seasons of Mob Psycho 100, which originally aired in 2016 and 2019 respectively, are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. A live-action adaptation was also produced in Japan in 2018, which is now available for streaming internationally through Netflix.  Source: Twitter                  Why Saiki K.

The producers behind the Mob Psycho 100 anime teased a new announcement related to the series.  The official Twitter account for the acclaimed action-comedy series tweeted out a message in both English and Japanese that states \"Did you know May 12th is MOB's birthday? You might want to make a note of that date...\" The teaser was accompanied with an image of Mob holding a flower. RELATED: Mob Psycho 100 Season 3 Teases a Bigger Role for Ritsu      The announcement is expected to be related to the third season of the series' anime adaptation, which was confirmed to be in production last October. The third season is being produced by BONES, the studio behind the first two seasons of the show and numerous other hit anime, including Eureka Seven and Ouran High School Host Club. The new season will be co-directed by Takahiro Hasui, who previously worked as an episode director on Sk8 the Infinity, and Yuzuru Tachikawa, who directed the previous two seasons of the show. The voice cast, which includes Setsuo Ito as Mob and Food Wars: Shougeki No Shoma's Takahiro Sakurai as Reigen, are all expected to reprise their roles. A premiere date for the third season has yet to be announced.  Mob Psycho 100 tells the story of Shigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama, a seemingly normal and somewhat forgettable middle school student who is in actuality one of the world's most powerful espers. In order to keep his immense psychic powers under control, Mob is forced to carefully maintain his composure and avoid any strong feelings or emotions, which hinders his ability to live a normal life. Things change when he meets Reigen Arataka, a con-man who promotes himself as an exorcist, who gives Mob a job and promises to help him learn how to control his abilities. RELATED: Mob Psycho 100: Shigeo's True Power Is Bringing Out the Best in People  The anime is based on a manga that was written and drawn by ONE, the author who also created One-Punch Man. The series premiered in 2012 in Shogakukan's Ura Sunday magazine, where it was serialized until it concluded in late 2017. ONE followed up the manga with a spinoff, Reigen, which was serialized from 2018 \u2013 2019. Both the original Mob Psycho 100 and its spinoff are localized and distributed in English by Dark Horse Comics. The first two seasons of Mob Psycho 100, which originally aired in 2016 and 2019 respectively, are available for streaming on Crunchyroll. A live-action adaptation was also produced in Japan in 2018, which is now available for streaming internationally through Netflix.  Source: Twitter                  Why Saiki K.

A new One Piece Film: Red trailer released.  The new preview concentrates on the series' newest character, a young songstress named Uta. The singer is revealed to be the daughter of Red-Haired Shanks, the powerful captain who gave Luffy his iconic straw hat and inspired the boy to take up the life of a pirate. The trailer also features a few shots of Luffy in his new costume, which blends elements of classic pirate attire with punk rock stylings. The clip ends by confirming the movie's Japanese premiere date, Aug. 6. RELATED: One Piece Debuts New Straw Hat Pirates Costumes in Full Color    One Piece Film: Red is the 15th film in the long-running shonen adventure series. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island in order to attend a music festival. In addition to Luffy's new jacket and hat, the rest of the Straw Hat crew will also don new, musically-inspired costumes throughout the movie.  Production on the new film is being supervised by the manga's original creator, Eiichiro Oda. According to Oda, the movie was inspired by his desire to add this new character to the series' cast. The script for the new movie is being penned by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, who previously wrote One Piece Film: Gold. The new film is being directed by Code Geass' Goro Taniguchi. The anime series' voice cast will reprise their roles for the movie. RELATED: One Piece: What We Know About Nika So Far\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b One Piece fans suddenly have a lot to look forward to, as Toei Animation also recently announced that the anime will begin airing new episodes again. The series was placed on indefinite hiatus after March 6, when Toei was the victim with a targeted ransomware attack that halted production on several of the studio's biggest projects, including the One Piece TV anime. Both One Piece and Digimon: Ghost Game will resume the broadcast of new episodes on April 17. However, Toei Animation's arguably biggest release of the year, the Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero movie, has yet to receive a new release date. Production on the movie was also stalled by the hack and it will no longer be released on its originally announced April 22 premiere date.  The One Piece manga is available in English from VIZ Media. The entire anime series is available for streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation, while select seasons and movies are also available on Netflix. Crunchyroll has confirmed it will resume its simulcast of the series as new episodes premiere in Japan.

The world of Japanese anime and manga features numerous famous and mainstream romance and drama titles, such as the shojo classic Fruits Basket starring the lovers Tohru and Kyo, along with shows such as Maid-Sama! and many others. However, many other solid romances fall right under the radar, including the underrated After the Rain.  This short but sweet manga/anime franchise, created by Jun Mayuzuki, tells the tale of the kind-hearted kuudere heroine Akira Tachibana and her one-sided crush on her manager at work, a single father named Masami Kondo. What follows is not an awkward romance between a teenager and a middle-aged man, but rather a tale of healing and self-acceptance told in the framework of a would-be romance. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          The Tale Of Healing In After The Rain                At first glance, After the Rain is a traditional romance story that could potentially be problematic given that the heroine Akira is 17 years old and Mr. Kondo is 45 -- old enough to be Akira's father. Many anime fans know that various franchises have pushed things with iffy romances before, but fortunately, After the Rain has much more finesse than that. Akira nurses a strong crush on Mr. Kondo and expresses it more than once, but as a smart and responsible man, Mr. Kondo keeps Akira at arm's length and treats her as a platonic friend. This means that the story is less about conventional romance and more about healing the heart. There are more routes for a romance story to take than a predictable \"happily ever after\" riding into the sunset.  After the Rain uses its would-be romance story as the framework for something just as sweet and inspiring as a wholesome romance -- that being a story of healing and self-acceptance. In many cases, a romance isn't just about longing and lust but also about how love can potentially soothe a wounded heart and help a person come to terms with their own problems. This isn't always the case, but when things go right, a romance can heal and strengthen both people in the relationship, whether or not they start going steady or eventually marry. This is exactly the case with After the Rain. In this story, Akira Tachibana is passionate about running track, but a recent leg injury sidelined her, and she feels miserable about her everyday life as a high school student missing out on track meets. She busies herself by working at a restaurant named Garden, where she soon develops a crush on her kind-hearted manager, who gives off a paternal and nurturing vibe. Most likely, this is what drew Akira to him, as her heart needed healing and Mr. Kondo's personality is all about generosity and caring for others.  In the end, the two of them don't get together, but they didn't have to. Akira's leg and heart both recover, and soon after turning 18, she resumes running track and finds happiness once again. Meanwhile, Akira's youthful innocence and energy inspire Mr. Kondo to reignite his passion for literature and writing, which he had abandoned years ago. On his platonic dates with Akira, he often encouraged her to embrace literature and learning, but he benefited from this almost as much as Akira did and was much happier for it. RELATED: The Best Comedy High School Anime Series You Can Watch Right Now          How After The Rain Portrays A Restrained Romance                To begin with, After the Rain shows restraint by not showing any explicit scenes between Akira and Mr. Kondo -- in fact, it's highly unlikely that any such scenes took place at all, whether shown on-screen or not. This may be a romantic seinen manga/anime franchise, but the author saw no need to throw in some fan service just for the sake of it. Doing so would sabotage After the Rain's wholesome message about healing and might stir up unwanted controversy as well. It's clear that Akira's crush on Mr. Kondo is strong and genuine, especially when Akira directly tells Mr. Kondo about it. All the same, Mr. Kondo and the narrative alike hold back, knowing that Akira is off-limits to a man his age. Instead, Mr. Kondo acts more like a role model and parental figure for Akira. Akira is the only one with a crush, and this is largely portrayed as the kind of innocent crush schoolgirls get on their handsome, kind-hearted male teachers.  These harmless crushes don't lead to a serious romance, but they might inspire the amorous character to push themselves harder to live up to their crush's expectations of them, growing as a person in the process. This is the route After the Rain follows, and in turn, any fan of the series can follow its example and better themselves with the power of self-acceptance and healing.

The world of Japanese anime and manga features numerous famous and mainstream romance and drama titles, such as the shojo classic Fruits Basket starring the lovers Tohru and Kyo, along with shows such as Maid-Sama! and many others. However, many other solid romances fall right under the radar, including the underrated After the Rain.  This short but sweet manga/anime franchise, created by Jun Mayuzuki, tells the tale of the kind-hearted kuudere heroine Akira Tachibana and her one-sided crush on her manager at work, a single father named Masami Kondo. What follows is not an awkward romance between a teenager and a middle-aged man, but rather a tale of healing and self-acceptance told in the framework of a would-be romance. RELATED: Komi Can't Communicate & Other Great High School Anime Streaming on Netflix          The Tale Of Healing In After The Rain                At first glance, After the Rain is a traditional romance story that could potentially be problematic given that the heroine Akira is 17 years old and Mr. Kondo is 45 -- old enough to be Akira's father. Many anime fans know that various franchises have pushed things with iffy romances before, but fortunately, After the Rain has much more finesse than that. Akira nurses a strong crush on Mr. Kondo and expresses it more than once, but as a smart and responsible man, Mr. Kondo keeps Akira at arm's length and treats her as a platonic friend. This means that the story is less about conventional romance and more about healing the heart. There are more routes for a romance story to take than a predictable \"happily ever after\" riding into the sunset.  After the Rain uses its would-be romance story as the framework for something just as sweet and inspiring as a wholesome romance -- that being a story of healing and self-acceptance. In many cases, a romance isn't just about longing and lust but also about how love can potentially soothe a wounded heart and help a person come to terms with their own problems. This isn't always the case, but when things go right, a romance can heal and strengthen both people in the relationship, whether or not they start going steady or eventually marry. This is exactly the case with After the Rain. In this story, Akira Tachibana is passionate about running track, but a recent leg injury sidelined her, and she feels miserable about her everyday life as a high school student missing out on track meets. She busies herself by working at a restaurant named Garden, where she soon develops a crush on her kind-hearted manager, who gives off a paternal and nurturing vibe. Most likely, this is what drew Akira to him, as her heart needed healing and Mr. Kondo's personality is all about generosity and caring for others.  In the end, the two of them don't get together, but they didn't have to. Akira's leg and heart both recover, and soon after turning 18, she resumes running track and finds happiness once again. Meanwhile, Akira's youthful innocence and energy inspire Mr. Kondo to reignite his passion for literature and writing, which he had abandoned years ago. On his platonic dates with Akira, he often encouraged her to embrace literature and learning, but he benefited from this almost as much as Akira did and was much happier for it. RELATED: The Best Comedy High School Anime Series You Can Watch Right Now          How After The Rain Portrays A Restrained Romance                To begin with, After the Rain shows restraint by not showing any explicit scenes between Akira and Mr. Kondo -- in fact, it's highly unlikely that any such scenes took place at all, whether shown on-screen or not. This may be a romantic seinen manga/anime franchise, but the author saw no need to throw in some fan service just for the sake of it. Doing so would sabotage After the Rain's wholesome message about healing and might stir up unwanted controversy as well. It's clear that Akira's crush on Mr. Kondo is strong and genuine, especially when Akira directly tells Mr. Kondo about it. All the same, Mr. Kondo and the narrative alike hold back, knowing that Akira is off-limits to a man his age. Instead, Mr. Kondo acts more like a role model and parental figure for Akira. Akira is the only one with a crush, and this is largely portrayed as the kind of innocent crush schoolgirls get on their handsome, kind-hearted male teachers.  These harmless crushes don't lead to a serious romance, but they might inspire the amorous character to push themselves harder to live up to their crush's expectations of them, growing as a person in the process. This is the route After the Rain follows, and in turn, any fan of the series can follow its example and better themselves with the power of self-acceptance and healing.

They\u2019re going to love Idris [Elba] playing this character and they\u2019re going to want more of Knuckles absolutely. So right now, all the focus is just on getting people excited and getting them out to see the sequel. Then, we\u2019ll go from there.\" RELATED: Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Director Loves Your 'Sexy Knuckles' Memes \"He\u2019s such a wonderful character that there are so many different ways that you can go [in the series] that fans could really get excited by, so that will hopefully all come along very soon,\" Fowler continued. \"But for now, I\u2019m just so excited to get people to see the sequel.\"  The Knuckles spinoff series was first announced by Paramount in February 2022. \"The world of Sonic the Hedgehog has been capturing imaginations for decades, and we are thrilled to stretch the limits of what this franchise is capable of with world-class offerings both on the big screen and for Sonic fans at home,\" Sonic producer Neal Moritz said at the time. \"The sky is truly the limit, and I am immensely proud to be part of creating new Sonic content for longtime fans as well as introducing Sonic to a new generation.\" No further details have been revealed, including whether Sonic, Tails or the rest of the film's cast will appear in the spinoff series. Fans suspect that the Blue Blur could make an appearance given that Fowler has previously mentioned how having more than one super-powered character in Sonic 2 allowed the creative team to expand on the film's action scenes. \"You\u2019ve got Sonic's speed, you've got Knuckles' super strength, and we just put them in an environment and let them go at it... it just offers so much opportunity in terms of fight choreography and action,\" said Fowler.

The character has since appeared in several video games, comic books and television series, acting as an ally to the titular speedster. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 marked Knuckles' film debut and the first time Elba has voiced the character. He will reprise the role in the upcoming spinoff series. Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is currently playing in theaters. In addition to Elba, James Marsden, Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz, Colleen O'Shaughnessey and Tika Sumpter also star in the film. A third Sonic film is in early development.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for X-Men '92: House of XCII #1, now on sale from Marvel Comics   The changes to the mutant status quo in House of X and Powers of X are still being felt years later, with the Krakoa era continuing to define an entire corner of the Marvel Universe. Other realities are even exploring similar ideas, with one clearly connected to a version of X-Men '92, the fan-favorite animated adaptation of the franchise. But some of these tweaks for the animated-inspired timeline are genuinely surprising.  X-Men '92: House of XCII #1 by Steve Foxe, Salva Espin, Israel Silva, and VC's Joe Sabino reimagines Jubilee as this world's equivalent of Moira X -- positioning her to go down a similar dark path as the core-Marvel Universe version of Moira. RELATED: MCU Theory: X-Men '97 Revival Offers Clues to Doctor Strange 2                 In the core Marvel Universe of Earth-616, the events of House of X and Powers of X radically altered the status quo for the mutant population. Moira MacTaggert was retconned to have secretly been a mutant all along, with her powers allowing her to be born anew after each death -- each time restarting the timeline around her. Moira X's glimpses of the future allowed the heroes to form the nation of Krakoa and prepare for the machinations of forces like Nimrod, serving as a serious game-changer for the X-Men. A similar series of events seem to have happened in X-Men '92: House of XCII, which sees a variation of the X-Men similar to the incarnation from the X-Men animated series going through a similar process, relocating to Krakoa and uniting with past enemies. The biggest different initially appears that the resurrection protocols came too late to save their Jubilee, who perished in an attack on the Xavier Institute carried out by Sentinels.  But it turns out this isn't truly the case, as Jubilee is revealed to be this world's equivalent of Moira X, and is hiding on their version of Krakoa. She's revealed to have similar powers to Moira from Earth-616 on top of her traditional explosive abilities, and her current life is her tenth -- meaning this may be her final chance to save the world, hinting she received a prediciton from Destiny similar to the one that motivated much of Moira X's actions. While her death remains a motivating factor for the X-Men and Jubilee feels awful about hiding her survival from her teammates and friends, but Jubilee fears this may be last life -- and her last chance -- to prevent a future dominated by Nimrod and other Sentinels.  RELATED: MCU Leaker Debunks a Major Thor 4 X-Men Cameo Rumor                 It's a wild retcon, especially considering this world is implied to be incredibly similar to the one featured in the X-Men animated series. This suggests that in at least one timeline, all of the events of the animated show played out according to Jubilee's plans -- as she kept the true to her true importance a secret to even telepaths like Charles Xavier. Recasting Jubilee as Moira X potentially introduces a moral edge to her efforts that Moira X largely abandoned across the course of her time on Krakoa. It also sets the stage for this variant of Jubilee to go through a similar moral arc to Moira X, who has transitioned from being a dedicated ally to mutant-kind to perhaps their most dangerous enemy.  It'll be interesting to see how Jubilee X continues to evolve in this reality, and if she's doomed to walk a similar path as Moira X. Her role as a genuine inspiration for the X-Men means the truth may genuinely undo much of the progress Xavier and Magneto have made. But she also seems firmly committed to the X-Men's mission to change the world for the better and prevent Orchis from bringing about the end of mutant progress, meaning she might get the chance to save the world in a way Moira X failed to.

WARNING: The following contains spoilers for X-Men '92: House of XCII #1, now on sale from Marvel Comics   The changes to the mutant status quo in House of X and Powers of X are still being felt years later, with the Krakoa era continuing to define an entire corner of the Marvel Universe. Other realities are even exploring similar ideas, with one clearly connected to a version of X-Men '92, the fan-favorite animated adaptation of the franchise. But some of these tweaks for the animated-inspired timeline are genuinely surprising.  X-Men '92: House of XCII #1 by Steve Foxe, Salva Espin, Israel Silva, and VC's Joe Sabino reimagines Jubilee as this world's equivalent of Moira X -- positioning her to go down a similar dark path as the core-Marvel Universe version of Moira. RELATED: MCU Theory: X-Men '97 Revival Offers Clues to Doctor Strange 2                 In the core Marvel Universe of Earth-616, the events of House of X and Powers of X radically altered the status quo for the mutant population. Moira MacTaggert was retconned to have secretly been a mutant all along, with her powers allowing her to be born anew after each death -- each time restarting the timeline around her. Moira X's glimpses of the future allowed the heroes to form the nation of Krakoa and prepare for the machinations of forces like Nimrod, serving as a serious game-changer for the X-Men. A similar series of events seem to have happened in X-Men '92: House of XCII, which sees a variation of the X-Men similar to the incarnation from the X-Men animated series going through a similar process, relocating to Krakoa and uniting with past enemies. The biggest different initially appears that the resurrection protocols came too late to save their Jubilee, who perished in an attack on the Xavier Institute carried out by Sentinels.  But it turns out this isn't truly the case, as Jubilee is revealed to be this world's equivalent of Moira X, and is hiding on their version of Krakoa. She's revealed to have similar powers to Moira from Earth-616 on top of her traditional explosive abilities, and her current life is her tenth -- meaning this may be her final chance to save the world, hinting she received a prediciton from Destiny similar to the one that motivated much of Moira X's actions. While her death remains a motivating factor for the X-Men and Jubilee feels awful about hiding her survival from her teammates and friends, but Jubilee fears this may be last life -- and her last chance -- to prevent a future dominated by Nimrod and other Sentinels.  RELATED: MCU Leaker Debunks a Major Thor 4 X-Men Cameo Rumor                 It's a wild retcon, especially considering this world is implied to be incredibly similar to the one featured in the X-Men animated series. This suggests that in at least one timeline, all of the events of the animated show played out according to Jubilee's plans -- as she kept the true to her true importance a secret to even telepaths like Charles Xavier. Recasting Jubilee as Moira X potentially introduces a moral edge to her efforts that Moira X largely abandoned across the course of her time on Krakoa. It also sets the stage for this variant of Jubilee to go through a similar moral arc to Moira X, who has transitioned from being a dedicated ally to mutant-kind to perhaps their most dangerous enemy.  It'll be interesting to see how Jubilee X continues to evolve in this reality, and if she's doomed to walk a similar path as Moira X. Her role as a genuine inspiration for the X-Men means the truth may genuinely undo much of the progress Xavier and Magneto have made. But she also seems firmly committed to the X-Men's mission to change the world for the better and prevent Orchis from bringing about the end of mutant progress, meaning she might get the chance to save the world in a way Moira X failed to.

Home Anime Future Diary: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga    Future Diary: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga  By Timothy Donohoo Published 17 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Future Diary focuses on a group of 12 individuals fighting to the bitter end to become the god of Space and Time.                 Although it came out years ago, Future Diary is still considered one of the best and most fun battle royale-themed anime and manga franchises. Centered around a race to godhood, the series has taken quite a few forms and had just as many spinoffs. This has allowed it to retain its popularity even over ten years after the original manga ended, with streaming no doubt helping the anime.  Future Diary features several important characters, all of whom have their own backstories and reasons for fighting for the rank of deity. Many of the franchise's forms have been brought over to the West, while others are sadly much harder to come by. Here's what readers and viewers eager for a new battle royale-style series should know about Future Diary. RELATED: DanMachi: How to Get Started With the Anime, Manga & Light Novels           The Plot of Future Diary                 The main character of Future Diary is Yukiteru Amano, a rather socially distant teenager who keeps to himself and records what he sees from others on his phone. One of his only true friends is none other than Deus Ex Machina, the god that controls time and space. Deux Ex Machina transforms Amano's phone into a \"Future Diary\" that allows him to see into the future for up to 90 days. Unfortunately, he's not the only one with such a newfound power.  There are 11 other people who also have Future Diaries, and they must now all compete to see who will replace Deux Ex Machina as the god of Time and Space. Protecting Amano is the yandere stalker Yuno Gasai, who will do anything to keep him out of harm's way. Other competitors in this new battle royale include a terrorist who hates God, as well as an ordinary cop who wishes to end Deux Ex Machina's game. Given that it involves a battle for godhood, several similarities could be drawn between Future Diary and the more recent hit series Platinum End, with the protagonist of the latter even having the last name Mirai (literally \"Future\").  RELATED: Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Where to Read the Future Diary Manga                 Future Diary was created by Sakae Esuno and serialized in the magazine Shonen Ace from 2006 to 2010. This amounted to 12 collected volumes, although sadly, not all of these have been brought over to the West. Tokyopop initially handled the series in the West but only localized 10 of the 12 volumes, with the last of these releasing in 2011. Viz Media handled the series after Tokyopop ceased traditional publications, although it only released the series digitally. This is the best way to read the manga, as even physical retailers such as Barnes & Noble no longer carry the physical versions of Future Diary. Instead, those interested in reading the series should consider purchasing these volumes through Kindle & Comixology. Spinoffs such as Future Diary: Mosaic have also not been localized outside of Japan.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Bakuman          Where to Watch the Future Diary Anime                 Asread was the studio behind the anime version of Future Diary, which ran for 26 episodes from 2011 to 2012. The series was localized by Funimation, although it's also available to stream through both Funimation's now sister service Crunchyroll and Hulu. The OVA Future Diary: Redial served as an epilogue to the story, with a manga of the same name doing so for the original book. 2012 also saw the release of Future Diary: Another:World, a 12-episode live-action adaptation that remixed the premise with entirely new characters. However, this isn't currently available on any Western streaming service and has been kept in Japan.  Walmart, Target, Amazon and Right Stuf Anime all carry the Blu-ray collection of the Future Diary anime. This contains not only the entirety of the show but also the OVA epilogue Redial. For those without any of the aforementioned streaming services, this is probably the easiest way to watch the series.

Although it came out years ago, Future Diary is still considered one of the best and most fun battle royale-themed anime and manga franchises. Centered around a race to godhood, the series has taken quite a few forms and had just as many spinoffs. This has allowed it to retain its popularity even over ten years after the original manga ended, with streaming no doubt helping the anime.  Future Diary features several important characters, all of whom have their own backstories and reasons for fighting for the rank of deity. Many of the franchise's forms have been brought over to the West, while others are sadly much harder to come by. Here's what readers and viewers eager for a new battle royale-style series should know about Future Diary. RELATED: DanMachi: How to Get Started With the Anime, Manga & Light Novels           The Plot of Future Diary                 The main character of Future Diary is Yukiteru Amano, a rather socially distant teenager who keeps to himself and records what he sees from others on his phone. One of his only true friends is none other than Deus Ex Machina, the god that controls time and space. Deux Ex Machina transforms Amano's phone into a \"Future Diary\" that allows him to see into the future for up to 90 days. Unfortunately, he's not the only one with such a newfound power.  There are 11 other people who also have Future Diaries, and they must now all compete to see who will replace Deux Ex Machina as the god of Time and Space. Protecting Amano is the yandere stalker Yuno Gasai, who will do anything to keep him out of harm's way. Other competitors in this new battle royale include a terrorist who hates God, as well as an ordinary cop who wishes to end Deux Ex Machina's game. Given that it involves a battle for godhood, several similarities could be drawn between Future Diary and the more recent hit series Platinum End, with the protagonist of the latter even having the last name Mirai (literally \"Future\").  RELATED: Mars Red: How to Get Started With the Anime & Manga          Where to Read the Future Diary Manga                 Future Diary was created by Sakae Esuno and serialized in the magazine Shonen Ace from 2006 to 2010. This amounted to 12 collected volumes, although sadly, not all of these have been brought over to the West. Tokyopop initially handled the series in the West but only localized 10 of the 12 volumes, with the last of these releasing in 2011. Viz Media handled the series after Tokyopop ceased traditional publications, although it only released the series digitally. This is the best way to read the manga, as even physical retailers such as Barnes & Noble no longer carry the physical versions of Future Diary. Instead, those interested in reading the series should consider purchasing these volumes through Kindle & Comixology. Spinoffs such as Future Diary: Mosaic have also not been localized outside of Japan.  RELATED: How to Get Started With Bakuman          Where to Watch the Future Diary Anime                 Asread was the studio behind the anime version of Future Diary, which ran for 26 episodes from 2011 to 2012. The series was localized by Funimation, although it's also available to stream through both Funimation's now sister service Crunchyroll and Hulu. The OVA Future Diary: Redial served as an epilogue to the story, with a manga of the same name doing so for the original book. 2012 also saw the release of Future Diary: Another:World, a 12-episode live-action adaptation that remixed the premise with entirely new characters. However, this isn't currently available on any Western streaming service and has been kept in Japan.  Walmart, Target, Amazon and Right Stuf Anime all carry the Blu-ray collection of the Future Diary anime. This contains not only the entirety of the show but also the OVA epilogue Redial. For those without any of the aforementioned streaming services, this is probably the easiest way to watch the series.

Though it was difficult, Gohan has proven himself as a powerful Saiyan.                  Akira Toriyama\u2019s Dragon Ball remains one of the biggest shonen series of its generation. Dragon Ball has endured for so long because it offers so much for its audience to connect with, whether it\u2019s the anime\u2019s captivating characters, stressful battles, or the thrilling transformations that individuals experience when they\u2019re pushed past their limits. Dragon Ball begins as Goku\u2019s story, and he remains at the center of the narrative as he obtains greater levels of strength.  RELATED: 10 Times Gohan Was The Best Character In Dragon Ball Z However, Dragon Ball Z introduces Goku\u2019s son, Gohan, who makes a strong impression and seems destined to surpass Goku\u2019s power. Gohan's treatment throughout Dragon Ball is not without its flaws, but the strong Saiyan still gets many opportunities to prove his potential.  9          He\u2019s Never Died                Death is a tragic event in any anime series, but it fortunately hit as hard in Dragon Ball due to the restorative properties of the titular wish-granting orbs. Accordingly, many characters have perished on more than one occasion, even the series\u2019 strongest individuals like Goku and Vegeta. Gohan is teased as a prodigy from Dragon Ball Z's start when he gets a surprise attack in on Raditz. Powerful characters such as Piccolo even sacrifice themselves to protect Gohan and make sure he can continue to improve. These sacrifices would mean a little less if Gohan were to later pass away. He\u2019s come close, but he\u2019s yet to disappoint in this regard.  8          He Uses His Potential Unlock On Namek To Hold His Own With Frieza                The heroes\u2019 voyage to Planet Namek is a big turning point in Dragon Ball Z. Krillin and Gohan have to do a lot of the heavy lifting until Goku\u2019s arrival, which also fosters a temperamental alliance with Vegeta. Gohan\u2019s kind actions on the foreign planet lead to the Grand Elder Guru Namekian tapping into Gohan\u2019s latent potential and pulling it forward to give him a better chance at survival. Gohan doesn\u2019t let the Grand Elder Guru down and he uses this new strength to adequately fight against Frieza. Gohan is still a child, but he pushes Frieza\u2019s second form into defensive measures. Many adult fighters can\u2019t survive against Frieza, but Gohan does.  7          He Becomes The First Super Saiyan 2 And Defeats Cell                There are several ways to exhibit growth in Dragon Ball, but the anime has increasingly embraced Super Saiyan transformations as the biggest milestone when it comes to strength. Goku usually leads the way when it comes to new Super Saiyan transformations, which is why it makes such an impression when Gohan surpasses his father to become the first Super Saiyan 2. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Characters Gohan Might Never Surpass This is Gohan\u2019s crowning achievement in many respects and feels like a proper culmination of his growth. Gohan doesn\u2019t just become Super Saiyan 2, but he uses this power to eliminate Cell, which no one else could do.  6          He Mentors Future Trunks In His Timeline                It\u2019s safe to say that Goku and the rest of the heroes in Dragon Ball wouldn\u2019t be alive without Future Trunks\u2019 time travel intervention and the helpful hand that he lends against Cell. However, none of this would be possible without the strong foundation that Future Gohan instills in Trunks within their fractured timeline. Future Gohan mentors Trunks and helps him stay alive, but his own tragic death functions as the catalyst for Future Trunks\u2019 Super Saiyan transformation. Without this strength it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019d be able to take out Frieza when he arrives in the prime timeline.  5          He Receives Old Kai\u2019s Ultimate Upgrade                A lot of dangerous villains show up in Dragon Ball and Majin Buu is a threat that even leaves the Kai worried. Buu takes on many forms and multiple strategies are considered for the villain\u2019s defeat. Goku and his trusted Spirit Bomb eventually handle the situation, but for quite some time it appears as if Gohan will be the one to conquer the Majin menace. This confidence comes from the training that Gohan receives on the Sacred World of the Kai, his handling of the Z Sword, and the subsequent Ultimate upgrade that he receives from Old Kai. This is an extremely rare power boost, but Gohan is deemed worthy of the opportunity and new power.  4          He Becomes A Super Saiyan At A Younger Age Than Goku And Vegeta                Super Saiyan transformations become the norm in Dragon Ball, but for some time it\u2019s treated like an uncommon occurrence that only the greatest Saiyans receive. Goku and Vegeta are natural candidates for this power boost, yet they have to experience tremendous adversity to reach this plateau. RELATED: 10 Techniques Gohan Should Use In Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Gohan\u2019s growing strength allows him to become a Super Saiyan in a much more natural manner, but also at a young age \u2013 that\u2019s about a third of how old Goku and Vegeta are when they master this. It\u2019s extremely impressive and even Vegeta can\u2019t deny this.  3          He Defeats Bojack And Wins The Intergalactic Tournament                There are more than a dozen Dragon Ball feature films that feature heightened threats, yet they\u2019re largely understood to exist outside the series\u2019 proper canon. A lot of these movies put Goku in the spotlight and give him the win, but the ninth feature, Bojack Unbound, occurs during the period when Goku\u2019s passed away from Cell\u2019s self-destruction. Goku\u2019s demise makes Gohan the leading authority when Bojack and his team of skilled warriors threaten the planet through a macabre tournament. Gohan doesn\u2019t let his father down and is able to wipe out these extraterrestrial enemies and keep the planet safe during his absence.  2          He Protects The Peace As The Great Saiyaman                The heroes in Dragon Ball have protected the Earth from destruction on countless occasions, but the public at large are unaware of how close to danger they\u2019ve been. Goku and company primarily work in anonymity, but Gohan feels compelled to keep the public safe from street level violence and danger. Gohan\u2019s teen years put him in the superhero alter ego role of the Great Saiyaman, who might look and act silly, but it\u2019s an honorable use of his strength and skills. Gohan avoids teenage rebellion and an abuse of his powers.  1          He Leads Universe 7 As Team Leader In The Tournament Of Power                Dragon Ball Super explores some compelling growing pains with Gohan\u2019s character. Gohan is still powerful, but his strength has lapsed after so many years of a domestic life with Videl and their daughter, Pan. Gohan knows that his help is needed in Dragon Ball Super, and so he rises to the occasion and gets his groove back. It\u2019s quite touching when Gohan is elected as the team leader for Universe 7 in the multiversal battle royale, the Tournament of Power. Gohan might not be the strongest one on his team, but his role as leader demonstrates a wider range of knowledge and skill.                  9 Worst Things About Gohan  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Lists Anime Dragon Ball gohan anime     About The Author      Daniel Kurland                                     (1476 Articles Published)     Daniel Kurland is a freelance writer, comedian, and critic, who lives in the cultural mosaic that is Brooklyn, New York.

Though it was difficult, Gohan has proven himself as a powerful Saiyan.                  Akira Toriyama\u2019s Dragon Ball remains one of the biggest shonen series of its generation. Dragon Ball has endured for so long because it offers so much for its audience to connect with, whether it\u2019s the anime\u2019s captivating characters, stressful battles, or the thrilling transformations that individuals experience when they\u2019re pushed past their limits. Dragon Ball begins as Goku\u2019s story, and he remains at the center of the narrative as he obtains greater levels of strength.  RELATED: 10 Times Gohan Was The Best Character In Dragon Ball Z However, Dragon Ball Z introduces Goku\u2019s son, Gohan, who makes a strong impression and seems destined to surpass Goku\u2019s power. Gohan's treatment throughout Dragon Ball is not without its flaws, but the strong Saiyan still gets many opportunities to prove his potential.  9          He\u2019s Never Died                Death is a tragic event in any anime series, but it fortunately hit as hard in Dragon Ball due to the restorative properties of the titular wish-granting orbs. Accordingly, many characters have perished on more than one occasion, even the series\u2019 strongest individuals like Goku and Vegeta. Gohan is teased as a prodigy from Dragon Ball Z's start when he gets a surprise attack in on Raditz. Powerful characters such as Piccolo even sacrifice themselves to protect Gohan and make sure he can continue to improve. These sacrifices would mean a little less if Gohan were to later pass away. He\u2019s come close, but he\u2019s yet to disappoint in this regard.  8          He Uses His Potential Unlock On Namek To Hold His Own With Frieza                The heroes\u2019 voyage to Planet Namek is a big turning point in Dragon Ball Z. Krillin and Gohan have to do a lot of the heavy lifting until Goku\u2019s arrival, which also fosters a temperamental alliance with Vegeta. Gohan\u2019s kind actions on the foreign planet lead to the Grand Elder Guru Namekian tapping into Gohan\u2019s latent potential and pulling it forward to give him a better chance at survival. Gohan doesn\u2019t let the Grand Elder Guru down and he uses this new strength to adequately fight against Frieza. Gohan is still a child, but he pushes Frieza\u2019s second form into defensive measures. Many adult fighters can\u2019t survive against Frieza, but Gohan does.  7          He Becomes The First Super Saiyan 2 And Defeats Cell                There are several ways to exhibit growth in Dragon Ball, but the anime has increasingly embraced Super Saiyan transformations as the biggest milestone when it comes to strength. Goku usually leads the way when it comes to new Super Saiyan transformations, which is why it makes such an impression when Gohan surpasses his father to become the first Super Saiyan 2. RELATED: Dragon Ball: 10 Characters Gohan Might Never Surpass This is Gohan\u2019s crowning achievement in many respects and feels like a proper culmination of his growth. Gohan doesn\u2019t just become Super Saiyan 2, but he uses this power to eliminate Cell, which no one else could do.  6          He Mentors Future Trunks In His Timeline                It\u2019s safe to say that Goku and the rest of the heroes in Dragon Ball wouldn\u2019t be alive without Future Trunks\u2019 time travel intervention and the helpful hand that he lends against Cell. However, none of this would be possible without the strong foundation that Future Gohan instills in Trunks within their fractured timeline. Future Gohan mentors Trunks and helps him stay alive, but his own tragic death functions as the catalyst for Future Trunks\u2019 Super Saiyan transformation. Without this strength it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019d be able to take out Frieza when he arrives in the prime timeline.  5          He Receives Old Kai\u2019s Ultimate Upgrade                A lot of dangerous villains show up in Dragon Ball and Majin Buu is a threat that even leaves the Kai worried. Buu takes on many forms and multiple strategies are considered for the villain\u2019s defeat. Goku and his trusted Spirit Bomb eventually handle the situation, but for quite some time it appears as if Gohan will be the one to conquer the Majin menace. This confidence comes from the training that Gohan receives on the Sacred World of the Kai, his handling of the Z Sword, and the subsequent Ultimate upgrade that he receives from Old Kai. This is an extremely rare power boost, but Gohan is deemed worthy of the opportunity and new power.  4          He Becomes A Super Saiyan At A Younger Age Than Goku And Vegeta                Super Saiyan transformations become the norm in Dragon Ball, but for some time it\u2019s treated like an uncommon occurrence that only the greatest Saiyans receive. Goku and Vegeta are natural candidates for this power boost, yet they have to experience tremendous adversity to reach this plateau. RELATED: 10 Techniques Gohan Should Use In Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero Gohan\u2019s growing strength allows him to become a Super Saiyan in a much more natural manner, but also at a young age \u2013 that\u2019s about a third of how old Goku and Vegeta are when they master this. It\u2019s extremely impressive and even Vegeta can\u2019t deny this.  3          He Defeats Bojack And Wins The Intergalactic Tournament                There are more than a dozen Dragon Ball feature films that feature heightened threats, yet they\u2019re largely understood to exist outside the series\u2019 proper canon. A lot of these movies put Goku in the spotlight and give him the win, but the ninth feature, Bojack Unbound, occurs during the period when Goku\u2019s passed away from Cell\u2019s self-destruction. Goku\u2019s demise makes Gohan the leading authority when Bojack and his team of skilled warriors threaten the planet through a macabre tournament. Gohan doesn\u2019t let his father down and is able to wipe out these extraterrestrial enemies and keep the planet safe during his absence.  2          He Protects The Peace As The Great Saiyaman                The heroes in Dragon Ball have protected the Earth from destruction on countless occasions, but the public at large are unaware of how close to danger they\u2019ve been. Goku and company primarily work in anonymity, but Gohan feels compelled to keep the public safe from street level violence and danger. Gohan\u2019s teen years put him in the superhero alter ego role of the Great Saiyaman, who might look and act silly, but it\u2019s an honorable use of his strength and skills. Gohan avoids teenage rebellion and an abuse of his powers.  1          He Leads Universe 7 As Team Leader In The Tournament Of Power                Dragon Ball Super explores some compelling growing pains with Gohan\u2019s character. Gohan is still powerful, but his strength has lapsed after so many years of a domestic life with Videl and their daughter, Pan. Gohan knows that his help is needed in Dragon Ball Super, and so he rises to the occasion and gets his groove back. It\u2019s quite touching when Gohan is elected as the team leader for Universe 7 in the multiversal battle royale, the Tournament of Power. Gohan might not be the strongest one on his team, but his role as leader demonstrates a wider range of knowledge and skill.                  9 Worst Things About Gohan  Read Next     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email    Related Topics  Lists Anime Dragon Ball gohan anime     About The Author      Daniel Kurland                                     (1476 Articles Published)     Daniel Kurland is a freelance writer, comedian, and critic, who lives in the cultural mosaic that is Brooklyn, New York.

Now, with nine volumes to its name, the series has finally had its first episode released after the anime adaption was announced at the Kadokawa Light Novel Expo 2020.  The show follows the story of the reincarnated soul of Varvatos -- a powerful sorcerer who is no longer recognized as a human being. Reborn as Ard Meteor, he seeks to live an ordinary life in an effort to reconnect with mankind and build friendships with those around him. However, this is a little more difficult than Varvatos initially suspects.

Fortunately or unfortunately, Meteor has been blessed with magical and physical capabilities that are beyond the scope of those around him, despite them being considered average in his previous life.  On Ard\u2019s 10th birthday, his parents inform him that this is a special moment and one where he should start thinking about his dreams and future.

RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army Ultimately, viewers will likely become a little tired of this show if it's simply a tale of a young boy trying to make friends. Thankfully, it appears that there is more beneath the surface of this series through its fantasy world and character building. While the first episode starts off slowly, it soon builds to a climatic end, in which viewers witness their first battle against a group of goblins and are even privy to a significant time jump that will almost certainly be expanded upon in the following episode.  While it is too early to speculate what this series has in store or the quality that can be expected from it, it's certainly worth exploring for anyone who's a fan of the fantasy genre. Whether Ard Meteor\u2019s quest to fit in with humanity is fulfilled remains to be seen. However, it looks like there will be a lot of fun and interesting experiences to be had in following this journey. Hopefully, as the series progresses, more of the world will be explored and its magical components and characters will be developed further.                  Avatar: Who Did Zuko End Up With?

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

X-Force Annual #1   Writer  Nadia Shammas    Artist  Rafael Pimentel, Carlos Lopez    Letterer  VC's Joe Caramagna    Publisher  Marvel Comics    Price  4.99    Release Date  2022-04-06      Since its inception, X-Force has been touted as the black ops X-Men team that is usually delegated to handle all kinds of dirty work. For tasks that the X-Men can't or won't deal with, X-Force and its ragtag collection of less than savory, violence-loving characters usually get the job done. In the current world order, where Krakoa has redefined mutants as a force in the Marvel universe, X-Force remains the same but feels different. Its biggest threats come from its own teammates, especially Beast, who has lately been showing a frivolous disregard for the lives of pretty much anyone. Written by Nadia Shammas with artwork from Rafael Pimentel and Carlos Lopez and lettering by VC's Joe Caramagna, X-Force Annual #1 tells a story that continues ongoing arcs while developing the shady and distrustful dynamic that saturates this team.  X-Force Annual #1 follows the current X-Force team of Wolverine, Domino, and Quire as they are sent out on a covert mission to deal with a potential superweapon by Beast. On paper, it seems like your standard X-Force mission: get in, take out some bad guys, stop the weapon, and get out. Intel suggests that the Orchis have managed to steal a shipment from Hellfire Trading. As the mission progresses, it becomes clear that things aren't what they appear to be. The team starts to feel like maybe Beast has led them into a trap, but it's not clear why. RELATED: Marvel's Devil's Reign #6 Comic Review                  Nadia Shammas has a good handle on how each character of this ensemble cast responds and reacts to each other and their world. She shows off her good grasp of X-Men history and writing chops by creating a tense, suspicious atmosphere. The occasional well-placed bit of humor brings some much-needed levity to the book, as well. A pure highlight of this issue is Beast and Emma\u2019s conversation, which wonderfully showcases just how far gone the once-lovable blue boy has become. Emma asks some pointed questions, and Beast expertly \"addresses\" them, though the results of this conversation are something that the writer keeps close to her chest. Anticipation like this builds towards a feeling of dread and excitement in equal measure, leaving the reader wondering just what weaknesses Beast can exploit out of this situation.  Rafael Pimentel's art and Carlos Lopez's colors work well to bring this adventure to life. Each character is distinctly and instantly identifiable by their silhouettes and colors. Wolverine, in particular, is drawn as stocky and thick, harkening back to his original stature and energy, which is something a lot of recent iterations tend to forget. This is an X-Men book through and through in all its colorful, weird glory, with Pimentel and Lopez determined to make readers see that in every frame. Though there are some slight hiccups here and there with some awkward art and stiff character movement, the overall look of the book is still great.  RELATED: Marvel's Marauders #1 Comic Review                 In this ever-expanding story of \"What will Beast do next?\" X-Force Annual #1 manages to ask the more serious questions about Beast's motivations. A great setup scene with '90s action drives the story into a far more nefarious arc once it reaches its conclusion. Nadia Shammas carries forward the torch left by her predecessor, Benjamin Percy, and absolutely runs with it. Beast may not be evil per se, but his complete disregard for the individual lives of his teammates in his pursuit of the greater good is a worrying precedent, one that rightfully builds suspicion from his peers. What happens next remains to be seen, but X-Force Annual #1 stands as a testament to the spirit of fun and suspense that X-Men comics hold.

However, GTO has accrued its share of controversy: in Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson describes GTO as \"shameless, frequently sexist and totally hilarious\" -- an opinion that tracks as easily to the series' premise as its titular protagonist.  Violent and impulsive yet highly empathetic, Onizuka is also an inveterate pervert. The series begins with him trying to look up girls' skirts at a mall; to wit, his initial interest in teaching is a means to lose his virginity. He is assigned to Classroom 3-4 of Holy Forest Academy, home to the educational system's most notorious troublemakers. Like his predecessors -- one of whom committed suicide, another of whom had a nervous breakdown and the last of whom joined a cult -- he is expected to quickly fail.

These draw from far-fetched, even absurd conditions stemming from the unbelievable cruelty and cunning of Classroom 3-4's students.

However, while GTO at first goes to great lengths to present Urumi as inhuman and her conflict with Onizuka as absurd, the arc's subsequent acts reverse this, humanizing her. Highlighting how her experience of abuse and neglect has shaped her vendetta against teachers, her eventual friendship with Onizuka inspires a change in her character.

But Oshiro doesn't like Raido very much.                  The following contains spoilers for Episode 2 of Aharen-San is Indecipherable, \"Are We Being Followed?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Aharen-San is Indecipherable is a brand-new rom-com anime series in the Spring 2022 anime season, starring the petite Aharen Rain and her platonic male friend and classmate Raido. They befriended one another in Episode 1 as neighbors in class, but now in Episode 2, another character joins Aharen's tiny social circle.  Oshiro is a timid girl who has always watched over Aharen like a protective mother -- a dutiful self-appointed guardian who fears big guys like Raido. In Episode 2, Oshigo makes her presence known to Raido, and when they confront one another, a misunderstanding ensues. Raido's new friendship with Aharen certainly comes with its fair share of baggage. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                In Episode 2 of Aharen-San, Raido and Aharen continue to slowly and sweetly develop their budding friendship, and already, Aharen makes it clear that Raido is special to her. Aharen is a shy kuudere-type character who feels strong affection for others but has trouble expressing it, but all the same, her actions often speak louder than words. For now, Raido is too dense to realize how much Aharen cares for him, but he might pick up on that eventually. Meanwhile, another girl, Oshiro, picks up on it immediately. She can tell that Aharen and Raido are spending an awful lot of time together lately, so she must do something.  In Episode 2, Oshiro constantly spies on Raido, and during lunch, Oshiro finally confronts him while taking Aharen's side. Oshiro explains that she has always watched over Aharen to protect her from scary people, and she believes that the rather brawny Raido is dangerous. Oshiro clearly means well, but both Raido and Aharen assure her that there's nothing to be worried about. Raido is a gentle giant who treats Aharen well, and in return, Aharen is deeply fond of him. However, Oshiro isn't entirely convinced until the end of the episode, when she watches Raido and Aharen walking home together from afar. Oshiro still has those protective feelings, but if she's watching them from far enough to require binoculars, she's also too far away to intervene if things go wrong. Evidently, Oshiro no longer sees Raido as a threat to Aharen's safety, and that's progress -- granted, not much, but progress all the same.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward's Finale is Saved With the Power of Friendship                Oshiro's character arc is just beginning as of Episode 2 of Aharen-san is Indecipherble, but there are already some clues and hints as to what may be next for her and the rest of the cast. Characters like Oshiro don't easily give up on their defining character trait or attribute, even if these characters tone down their extreme behavior after their debut. Already, Oshiro trusts Raido a little more with Aharen, but it's unlikely that she will stop serving as Aharen's self-appointed guardian and mother hen anytime soon. She will likely keep this up, mainly for comic effect, but she might get more serious about it if other boys start hanging out with Aharen as well. Then Aharen might find herself explaining things all over again.  It's also possible that Oshiro may warm up to Raido and become his friend, although Aharen will probably always be number one in Oshiro's heart. Oshiro may decide that she's reluctant to have any boys around Aharen but that Raido can be the sole exception, and she might even trust him enough to have him share the duty of guarding Aharen. If so, that could strengthen Oshiro's and Raido's friendship, bonding over their mutual interest in Aharen. It also helps that Raido is a big and tough guy who could be intimidating if he wanted to, so Oshiro might value him as Aharen's best bodyguard from now on. Oshiro isn't big enough, strong enough or scary-looking enough to actually do much in Aharen's defense, so she can delegate that job to Raido to give herself some peace of mind. She certainly could use a break by now.

But Oshiro doesn't like Raido very much.                  The following contains spoilers for Episode 2 of Aharen-San is Indecipherable, \"Are We Being Followed?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll.   Aharen-San is Indecipherable is a brand-new rom-com anime series in the Spring 2022 anime season, starring the petite Aharen Rain and her platonic male friend and classmate Raido. They befriended one another in Episode 1 as neighbors in class, but now in Episode 2, another character joins Aharen's tiny social circle.  Oshiro is a timid girl who has always watched over Aharen like a protective mother -- a dutiful self-appointed guardian who fears big guys like Raido. In Episode 2, Oshigo makes her presence known to Raido, and when they confront one another, a misunderstanding ensues. Raido's new friendship with Aharen certainly comes with its fair share of baggage. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                In Episode 2 of Aharen-San, Raido and Aharen continue to slowly and sweetly develop their budding friendship, and already, Aharen makes it clear that Raido is special to her. Aharen is a shy kuudere-type character who feels strong affection for others but has trouble expressing it, but all the same, her actions often speak louder than words. For now, Raido is too dense to realize how much Aharen cares for him, but he might pick up on that eventually. Meanwhile, another girl, Oshiro, picks up on it immediately. She can tell that Aharen and Raido are spending an awful lot of time together lately, so she must do something.  In Episode 2, Oshiro constantly spies on Raido, and during lunch, Oshiro finally confronts him while taking Aharen's side. Oshiro explains that she has always watched over Aharen to protect her from scary people, and she believes that the rather brawny Raido is dangerous. Oshiro clearly means well, but both Raido and Aharen assure her that there's nothing to be worried about. Raido is a gentle giant who treats Aharen well, and in return, Aharen is deeply fond of him. However, Oshiro isn't entirely convinced until the end of the episode, when she watches Raido and Aharen walking home together from afar. Oshiro still has those protective feelings, but if she's watching them from far enough to require binoculars, she's also too far away to intervene if things go wrong. Evidently, Oshiro no longer sees Raido as a threat to Aharen's safety, and that's progress -- granted, not much, but progress all the same.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward's Finale is Saved With the Power of Friendship                Oshiro's character arc is just beginning as of Episode 2 of Aharen-san is Indecipherble, but there are already some clues and hints as to what may be next for her and the rest of the cast. Characters like Oshiro don't easily give up on their defining character trait or attribute, even if these characters tone down their extreme behavior after their debut. Already, Oshiro trusts Raido a little more with Aharen, but it's unlikely that she will stop serving as Aharen's self-appointed guardian and mother hen anytime soon. She will likely keep this up, mainly for comic effect, but she might get more serious about it if other boys start hanging out with Aharen as well. Then Aharen might find herself explaining things all over again.  It's also possible that Oshiro may warm up to Raido and become his friend, although Aharen will probably always be number one in Oshiro's heart. Oshiro may decide that she's reluctant to have any boys around Aharen but that Raido can be the sole exception, and she might even trust him enough to have him share the duty of guarding Aharen. If so, that could strengthen Oshiro's and Raido's friendship, bonding over their mutual interest in Aharen. It also helps that Raido is a big and tough guy who could be intimidating if he wanted to, so Oshiro might value him as Aharen's best bodyguard from now on. Oshiro isn't big enough, strong enough or scary-looking enough to actually do much in Aharen's defense, so she can delegate that job to Raido to give herself some peace of mind. She certainly could use a break by now.

Home Anime Dragon Ball Super Improved on Z's Biggest Problem - But Has It Done Enough?    Dragon Ball Super Improved on Z's Biggest Problem - But Has It Done Enough?  By Sam Stone Published 9 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Dragon Ball has had a checkered history with its female characters but Dragon Ball Super takes a big step in the right direction.                 The Dragon Ball franchise has had a complicated relationship with its female characters, often relegating them to comedic relief or eye candy rather than providing a noticeable roster of formidable female warriors who can hold their own with their male counterparts. Dragon Ball Super has improved this disparity considerably, even going as far to add female Super Saiyans for the first time in the franchise's canonical history. However, Dragon Ball's bad habits have since resurfaced in Super's manga continuation, serving as a reminder that there is plenty of room for the franchise to learn from its past mistakes.  Dragon Ball introduced powerful female fighters as early as the original series, with Goku's wife Chi-Chi progressing all the way to the qualifying rounds of the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, effectively making her one of the most proficient hand-to-hand combatants on Earth. However, once Chi-Chi married Goku and had two sons, in Gohan and Goten, she largely occupied herself with focusing on tending to their home and family rather than remain as an active participant in the Z Fighters' adventures. And Chi-Chi is unfortunately not the only character to follow this trend of diminished prominence.  RELATED: Dragon Ball, One Piece Anime Delays Were Caused by Ransomware Attack                 Gohan's eventual wife Videl was similarly introduced in Dragon Ball Z as an impressive fighter in her own right, earning a competitive slot in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. However, this would mark her final canonical battle in DBZ, with Videl eliminated from the first round after being brutally beaten by Spopovich. After marrying Gohan and having a daughter, Pan, with him, Videl has largely focused on her family like Chi-Chi did a generation before her. Android 18 is one of the big exceptions to this trend, who continued to play a major role in the story even after having a daughter with her husband Krillin. 18 went on to not only fight in the final round of DBZ's 25th World Martial Arts Tournament but also plays a huge part in Dragon Ball Super's climactic Tournament of Power, fighting alongside the Z Fighters to defend their reality from erasure. This tournament also featured a whole host of memorable female fights, with the most notable being Kale and Caulifla, fighters from Universe 6 who were able to transform into Super Saiyan 2.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Z: Is the Bojack Unbound Movie Canon?                 However, for as much progress as Dragon Ball has made recently, the \"Galactic Prisoner\" arc in the Dragon Ball Super manga featured three female villains who were reduced to comedic relief involving yet another gag on how much of a pervert Master Roshi is. Still, Super has taken great strides to position characters like Mai in a more positive, purposeful role among her male peers. That said, instances like the \"Galactic Prisoner\" gag is a reminder that sometimes Dragon Ball can fall back on its own bad habits. The upcoming film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero is poised to put Goku's granddaughter Pan back in the spotlight, although it's unclear what role she has to play. Beyond the movie, the future for the Dragon Ball franchise is still unclear, but hopefully it'll take cues from the great strides it took with introducing characters like Universe 6's female Super Saiyans. A lot of elements from Dragon Ball certainly haven't aged well, but the franchise is gradually taking the effort to catch up to modern sensibilities and should continue to do so.

By Sam Stone Published 9 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Dragon Ball has had a checkered history with its female characters but Dragon Ball Super takes a big step in the right direction.                 The Dragon Ball franchise has had a complicated relationship with its female characters, often relegating them to comedic relief or eye candy rather than providing a noticeable roster of formidable female warriors who can hold their own with their male counterparts. Dragon Ball Super has improved this disparity considerably, even going as far to add female Super Saiyans for the first time in the franchise's canonical history. However, Dragon Ball's bad habits have since resurfaced in Super's manga continuation, serving as a reminder that there is plenty of room for the franchise to learn from its past mistakes.  Dragon Ball introduced powerful female fighters as early as the original series, with Goku's wife Chi-Chi progressing all the way to the qualifying rounds of the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, effectively making her one of the most proficient hand-to-hand combatants on Earth. However, once Chi-Chi married Goku and had two sons, in Gohan and Goten, she largely occupied herself with focusing on tending to their home and family rather than remain as an active participant in the Z Fighters' adventures. And Chi-Chi is unfortunately not the only character to follow this trend of diminished prominence.  RELATED: Dragon Ball, One Piece Anime Delays Were Caused by Ransomware Attack                 Gohan's eventual wife Videl was similarly introduced in Dragon Ball Z as an impressive fighter in her own right, earning a competitive slot in the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament. However, this would mark her final canonical battle in DBZ, with Videl eliminated from the first round after being brutally beaten by Spopovich. After marrying Gohan and having a daughter, Pan, with him, Videl has largely focused on her family like Chi-Chi did a generation before her. Android 18 is one of the big exceptions to this trend, who continued to play a major role in the story even after having a daughter with her husband Krillin. 18 went on to not only fight in the final round of DBZ's 25th World Martial Arts Tournament but also plays a huge part in Dragon Ball Super's climactic Tournament of Power, fighting alongside the Z Fighters to defend their reality from erasure. This tournament also featured a whole host of memorable female fights, with the most notable being Kale and Caulifla, fighters from Universe 6 who were able to transform into Super Saiyan 2.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Z: Is the Bojack Unbound Movie Canon?                 However, for as much progress as Dragon Ball has made recently, the \"Galactic Prisoner\" arc in the Dragon Ball Super manga featured three female villains who were reduced to comedic relief involving yet another gag on how much of a pervert Master Roshi is. Still, Super has taken great strides to position characters like Mai in a more positive, purposeful role among her male peers. That said, instances like the \"Galactic Prisoner\" gag is a reminder that sometimes Dragon Ball can fall back on its own bad habits. The upcoming film Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero is poised to put Goku's granddaughter Pan back in the spotlight, although it's unclear what role she has to play. Beyond the movie, the future for the Dragon Ball franchise is still unclear, but hopefully it'll take cues from the great strides it took with introducing characters like Universe 6's female Super Saiyans. A lot of elements from Dragon Ball certainly haven't aged well, but the franchise is gradually taking the effort to catch up to modern sensibilities and should continue to do so.

Home Anime Which Psycho-Pass Season Is Best?    Which Psycho-Pass Season Is Best?  By Ederlyn Peralta Published 19 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Out of all three seasons of Psycho-Pass, season one stands out the most. Here's why!                 Production I.G. produced three exciting seasons of the cyberpunk psychological thriller Psycho-Pass. The second season provided a shock value ending, while the third season introduced an entirely new set of characters into the world of the series. However, if viewers were to compare all three seasons, the sequels clearly don't live up to the standard of the first season. Here\u2019s why the first season is the best season within the franchise.  The first season of Psycho-Pass focuses on the adventures of rookie inspector Akane Tsunemori. She and her partner Shinya Kogami are trying to stop a high-profile criminal named Shogo Makishima. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King's Censorship Hinders Progress on Important Conversations          The World of Psycho-Pass                 One aspect that viewers can praise in all seasons is the dystopia world-building within Psycho-Pass. The series is set in a futuristic Japan where the government is run by a supercomputer known as the Sibyl System. The Sibyl System is an advanced piece of technology used to serve the betterment of society by using an algorithm to determine whether or not an individual is likely to commit a crime. The assessment is known as a \u201cPsycho-Pass\u201d and includes a person\u2019s \u201cCrime Coefficient\u201d -- a numeric number that reveals a person\u2019s crime potentiality -- and a color-coded \"Hue system\" that reveals a person\u2019s mental and emotional state. Law enforcement uses a gun known as a Dominator to help scan targeted individuals that impose a threat to society.  Each season explores more aspects of the technology used in this dystopian society. In season two, viewers get more insight into the duties of an Enforcer, while in season three, fans are introduced to the criminal organization Bifrost, which uses an AI system to predict outcomes of real-world events, giving criminals a chance to commit illegal gambling. Furthermore, the Sibyl System expands beyond Japan as more countries start utilizing the system. There\u2019s also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stops international crime within this dystopian society. RELATED: What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?  The first season was written by Gen Urobuchi, the mastermind behind Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. The second and third seasons were written by Tow Ubukata under the supervision of Urobuchi. These latter two seasons added more world-building to Psycho-Pass, but it doesn\u2019t beat the originality and creativity that Urobuchi set forth, which makes the first series superior to the sequels.          Philosophical Questions Presented in Psycho-Pass                 The first season introduces some philosophical questions about freedom and justice. The Sibyl System\u2019s purpose is to protect society, but it limits a person\u2019s freedom to do what they desire. Every citizen\u2019s career and life path is predetermined by the Sibyl System so that they can maintain a happy and healthy mental state. Even if a person would like to take a different career route, they can\u2019t freely do so because it might threaten their clear-colored Hue and increase their Crime Coefficient.  Now, the Sibyl System seems to have the best interest of its citizens at heart, but the authoritarian system underhandedly forces people to voluntarily give up certain freedoms. Thus, this story invites readers to question whether or not they would be willing to give up their human rights for peace and protection. The series also highlights the importance of people's mental and emotional health. Citizens do many productive things to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, yet ironically, the series showcases that sometimes, too much of a good thing can also be a bad thing. In the show, there are certain criminal cases where healthy individuals' minds deteriorate due to traumatic events or unfair circumstances beyond their control. It is in these cases that people question the Sibyl System's control and power.  RELATED: What's the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Furthermore, the series makes viewers think about how justice is served and who determines what's right and wrong. The main protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, discovers that the Sibyl System is a supercomputer capable of making 'humane' decisions based on algorithms and logical reasoning. Tsunemori realizes the dangers of having a supercomputer governing society: it will only care about its goal of a 'perfect' society and eliminate those who don't fit its programmed standards. The Sibyl System\u2019s goal of a 'perfect' society is threatened when it discovers individuals that do not fit within its system. In season one, the main antagonist, Shogo Makishima, is a criminal mastermind whose primary goal is to destroy the Sibyl System. Makishima is a criminal, but he goes undetected by the Dominator because his crime coefficient still isn\u2019t high enough to be deemed a criminal under the Sibyl System\u2019s law.  As a result, former Inspector and current Enforcer Shinya Kogami takes matters into his own hands and becomes a vigilante to punish Makishima for killing and mutilating his colleague Mitsuru Sasayama. Kogami is a prime example of someone who believes in justice, but not under the means of the law within society. In addition, audiences gain insight into the complexity of a criminal's mind and how good and bad aren't easily defined. Kogami\u2019s actions in solving the Makishima case present some philosophical questions about justice. One of these questions involves whether it is justified for Kogami to go against the law and kill Makishima or if justice should always be served under the law. This question is further explored when Tsunemori argues that no one is above the law. Psycho-Pass argues that justice isn\u2019t always black and white -- and unlike the other two seasons, season one presents a storyline to viewers that allows them to contemplate questions such as how justice should be defined and who has the right to fairly distribute the law.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward: The Biggest Plot Twists That Defined the Anime          Akane Tsunemori, Heroine of Justice and Fairness                 Season one also introduces a strong and virtuous female protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. Usually, female protagonists in crime thrillers are dependent on their male counterparts for protection and leadership. However, Tsunemori isn't that type of person. In the first episode, \"Crime Coefficient,\" Tsunemori is assigned to handle a hostage case. While on the scene, the hostage's crime coefficient increased enough to make her a potential criminal. Kogami initially plans to execute the hostage before she can commit a crime, but instead, Tsunemori uses her Dominator to paralyze Kogami, then calms the woman down in order to lower her crime coefficient.  In this first episode, viewers can see that Tsunemori is willing to risk her own life and job to protect others, but she does so in the most intuitive yet logical method. She doesn't let her emotions interfere with her job, even when others try to manipulate her. She makes sure that every decision and action is based on what she thinks is morally justified and fair within the boundaries of the law. In fact, when Kogami's emotions interfere with his job, Tsunemori acts as his voice of reason. Although fans often romantically ship Kogami and Tsunemori, the story does not develop any sort of romance between them. If there was a romance plotline, it would undermine Tsunemori's characterization as an independent and assertive career woman who still shows empathy and understanding to those she cares about. She's definitely a role model for women interested in forensic science or criminal justice. It is a strategic move to keep Tsunemori as she, as later on in the other seasons, viewers see her willpower and strong belief in the law being put to the test.  Every Psycho-Pass season has its merits, but season one stands out thanks to its suspenseful and thrilling storyline and well-developed characters. However, what makes this season the best is the intricate world-building surrounding the Sibyl System and its philosophical questions about justice.

By Ederlyn Peralta Published 19 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Out of all three seasons of Psycho-Pass, season one stands out the most. Here's why!                 Production I.G. produced three exciting seasons of the cyberpunk psychological thriller Psycho-Pass. The second season provided a shock value ending, while the third season introduced an entirely new set of characters into the world of the series. However, if viewers were to compare all three seasons, the sequels clearly don't live up to the standard of the first season. Here\u2019s why the first season is the best season within the franchise.  The first season of Psycho-Pass focuses on the adventures of rookie inspector Akane Tsunemori. She and her partner Shinya Kogami are trying to stop a high-profile criminal named Shogo Makishima. RELATED: Requiem of the Rose King's Censorship Hinders Progress on Important Conversations          The World of Psycho-Pass                 One aspect that viewers can praise in all seasons is the dystopia world-building within Psycho-Pass. The series is set in a futuristic Japan where the government is run by a supercomputer known as the Sibyl System. The Sibyl System is an advanced piece of technology used to serve the betterment of society by using an algorithm to determine whether or not an individual is likely to commit a crime. The assessment is known as a \u201cPsycho-Pass\u201d and includes a person\u2019s \u201cCrime Coefficient\u201d -- a numeric number that reveals a person\u2019s crime potentiality -- and a color-coded \"Hue system\" that reveals a person\u2019s mental and emotional state. Law enforcement uses a gun known as a Dominator to help scan targeted individuals that impose a threat to society.  Each season explores more aspects of the technology used in this dystopian society. In season two, viewers get more insight into the duties of an Enforcer, while in season three, fans are introduced to the criminal organization Bifrost, which uses an AI system to predict outcomes of real-world events, giving criminals a chance to commit illegal gambling. Furthermore, the Sibyl System expands beyond Japan as more countries start utilizing the system. There\u2019s also the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stops international crime within this dystopian society. RELATED: What Does Hair Color Mean in Tokyo Ghoul?  The first season was written by Gen Urobuchi, the mastermind behind Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero. The second and third seasons were written by Tow Ubukata under the supervision of Urobuchi. These latter two seasons added more world-building to Psycho-Pass, but it doesn\u2019t beat the originality and creativity that Urobuchi set forth, which makes the first series superior to the sequels.          Philosophical Questions Presented in Psycho-Pass                 The first season introduces some philosophical questions about freedom and justice. The Sibyl System\u2019s purpose is to protect society, but it limits a person\u2019s freedom to do what they desire. Every citizen\u2019s career and life path is predetermined by the Sibyl System so that they can maintain a happy and healthy mental state. Even if a person would like to take a different career route, they can\u2019t freely do so because it might threaten their clear-colored Hue and increase their Crime Coefficient.  Now, the Sibyl System seems to have the best interest of its citizens at heart, but the authoritarian system underhandedly forces people to voluntarily give up certain freedoms. Thus, this story invites readers to question whether or not they would be willing to give up their human rights for peace and protection. The series also highlights the importance of people's mental and emotional health. Citizens do many productive things to maintain a happy and healthy lifestyle, yet ironically, the series showcases that sometimes, too much of a good thing can also be a bad thing. In the show, there are certain criminal cases where healthy individuals' minds deteriorate due to traumatic events or unfair circumstances beyond their control. It is in these cases that people question the Sibyl System's control and power.  RELATED: What's the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Furthermore, the series makes viewers think about how justice is served and who determines what's right and wrong. The main protagonist, Akane Tsunemori, discovers that the Sibyl System is a supercomputer capable of making 'humane' decisions based on algorithms and logical reasoning. Tsunemori realizes the dangers of having a supercomputer governing society: it will only care about its goal of a 'perfect' society and eliminate those who don't fit its programmed standards. The Sibyl System\u2019s goal of a 'perfect' society is threatened when it discovers individuals that do not fit within its system. In season one, the main antagonist, Shogo Makishima, is a criminal mastermind whose primary goal is to destroy the Sibyl System. Makishima is a criminal, but he goes undetected by the Dominator because his crime coefficient still isn\u2019t high enough to be deemed a criminal under the Sibyl System\u2019s law.  As a result, former Inspector and current Enforcer Shinya Kogami takes matters into his own hands and becomes a vigilante to punish Makishima for killing and mutilating his colleague Mitsuru Sasayama. Kogami is a prime example of someone who believes in justice, but not under the means of the law within society. In addition, audiences gain insight into the complexity of a criminal's mind and how good and bad aren't easily defined. Kogami\u2019s actions in solving the Makishima case present some philosophical questions about justice. One of these questions involves whether it is justified for Kogami to go against the law and kill Makishima or if justice should always be served under the law. This question is further explored when Tsunemori argues that no one is above the law. Psycho-Pass argues that justice isn\u2019t always black and white -- and unlike the other two seasons, season one presents a storyline to viewers that allows them to contemplate questions such as how justice should be defined and who has the right to fairly distribute the law.  RELATED: Tokyo 24th Ward: The Biggest Plot Twists That Defined the Anime          Akane Tsunemori, Heroine of Justice and Fairness                 Season one also introduces a strong and virtuous female protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. Usually, female protagonists in crime thrillers are dependent on their male counterparts for protection and leadership. However, Tsunemori isn't that type of person. In the first episode, \"Crime Coefficient,\" Tsunemori is assigned to handle a hostage case. While on the scene, the hostage's crime coefficient increased enough to make her a potential criminal. Kogami initially plans to execute the hostage before she can commit a crime, but instead, Tsunemori uses her Dominator to paralyze Kogami, then calms the woman down in order to lower her crime coefficient.  In this first episode, viewers can see that Tsunemori is willing to risk her own life and job to protect others, but she does so in the most intuitive yet logical method. She doesn't let her emotions interfere with her job, even when others try to manipulate her. She makes sure that every decision and action is based on what she thinks is morally justified and fair within the boundaries of the law. In fact, when Kogami's emotions interfere with his job, Tsunemori acts as his voice of reason. Although fans often romantically ship Kogami and Tsunemori, the story does not develop any sort of romance between them. If there was a romance plotline, it would undermine Tsunemori's characterization as an independent and assertive career woman who still shows empathy and understanding to those she cares about. She's definitely a role model for women interested in forensic science or criminal justice. It is a strategic move to keep Tsunemori as she, as later on in the other seasons, viewers see her willpower and strong belief in the law being put to the test.  Every Psycho-Pass season has its merits, but season one stands out thanks to its suspenseful and thrilling storyline and well-developed characters. However, what makes this season the best is the intricate world-building surrounding the Sibyl System and its philosophical questions about justice.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, \"My Girlfriend is Super Cute,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season has introduced anime fans to many new and returning rom-com anime series, from the lovely Aharen-san is Indecipherable to familiar faces such as the shojo-style shonen Komi Can't Communicate and the romantic battle of wits of Kaguya-Sama: Love is War. Then there's Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, another new series that rom-com fans are sure to enjoy.  In many regards, Shikimori is a conventional rom-com high school series like Horimiya, but even if it doesn't reinvent the wheel, its central pairing is unusual in a certain way that fans of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You are sure to recognize. In Shikimori, the main lovers are already in a solid relationship, so all conflict must be external, and already, Episode 1 proves that to be the case. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie goes to great lengths to establish the characters of Izumi and Shikimori, as well as their interpersonal dynamic, and it should all feel familiar to TONIKAWA fans. To begin with, Izumi is a gentle and caring male lead akin to Horimiya's Miyamura Izumi, who happens to have the same name as Shikimori's male lead. Both boys are noted for bucking the trend of being blunt and aggressive male leads, which can provide some much-needed respite from that archetype.  In a way, male leads like both Izumis and even Gojo Wakana are written for the \"female gaze,\" with them being ideal partners for girls who want a sensitive and affectionate partner rather than a bad boy. Gentle leads like Izumi won't appeal to every anime fan out there, but they help demonstrate that male leads are not all the same, and several anime seasons ago, TONIKAWA knew it too. Yuzaki Nasa, the male lead of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You, was a responsible, humble and generous boy who only cared about making his new bride, the mysterious Tsukasa, happy and comfortable. Some anime fans might find characters like Nasa and Izumi boring, but their fans will appreciate how generous and conflict-free these characters can be in their arcs, and it makes for an unusually stable central romance when compared to series such as Toradora! and Nisekoi.  Similarly, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie and TONIKAWA both feature female co-leads who are \"stronger\" than the male lead by having more skills and a more proactive personality, and they are the ones who drive each scene and episode forward. These girls greatly appreciate their male partners for who they are, and this further stabilizes the relationship. So, if the main couple is frictionless, the conflict must come from somewhere else. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Every story, even a gentle slice-of-life anime series, needs some form of conflict, as this is what drives a story and its characters forward in any genre or subgenre. In romances, the two main lovers may have any number of conflicts with one another, from unfaithfulness to a clash of personalities or simply disagreeing on how quickly their relationship should unfold, among other potential obstacles. Examples include the romance between Kyo and Tohru in Fruits Basket or the bickering main couple of Nisekoi, but Shikimori's main couple lacks conflict like that since they get along so well. If the anime doesn't want to bore its viewers, it can and should borrow from TONIKAWA's playbook.  TONIKAWA's main couple has zero friction, so the conflict was purely external, such as the main characters' apartment burning down in a freak accident and other characters testing or even doubting the validity of their marriage. To Nasa and Tsukasa, it was an \"us vs. the world\" conflict, and at this rate, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie might do the same. After all, many of the students doubt whether Izumi really deserves a stellar girlfriend like Shikimori, and Shikimori and Izumi are slightly insecure about their respective roles in the relationship. If other characters take advantage of this while serving as antagonists, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie will have all the conflict its viewers can handle. Challengers may soon appear, and Shikimori and Izumi must get ready to form a team to fend them off -- otherwise, their seemingly perfect relationship is doomed.

RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie goes to great lengths to establish the characters of Izumi and Shikimori, as well as their interpersonal dynamic, and it should all feel familiar to TONIKAWA fans. To begin with, Izumi is a gentle and caring male lead akin to Horimiya's Miyamura Izumi, who happens to have the same name as Shikimori's male lead. Both boys are noted for bucking the trend of being blunt and aggressive male leads, which can provide some much-needed respite from that archetype.  In a way, male leads like both Izumis and even Gojo Wakana are written for the \"female gaze,\" with them being ideal partners for girls who want a sensitive and affectionate partner rather than a bad boy. Gentle leads like Izumi won't appeal to every anime fan out there, but they help demonstrate that male leads are not all the same, and several anime seasons ago, TONIKAWA knew it too. Yuzaki Nasa, the male lead of TONIKAWA: Over the Moon For You, was a responsible, humble and generous boy who only cared about making his new bride, the mysterious Tsukasa, happy and comfortable. Some anime fans might find characters like Nasa and Izumi boring, but their fans will appreciate how generous and conflict-free these characters can be in their arcs, and it makes for an unusually stable central romance when compared to series such as Toradora! and Nisekoi.  Similarly, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie and TONIKAWA both feature female co-leads who are \"stronger\" than the male lead by having more skills and a more proactive personality, and they are the ones who drive each scene and episode forward. These girls greatly appreciate their male partners for who they are, and this further stabilizes the relationship. So, if the main couple is frictionless, the conflict must come from somewhere else. RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Every story, even a gentle slice-of-life anime series, needs some form of conflict, as this is what drives a story and its characters forward in any genre or subgenre. In romances, the two main lovers may have any number of conflicts with one another, from unfaithfulness to a clash of personalities or simply disagreeing on how quickly their relationship should unfold, among other potential obstacles. Examples include the romance between Kyo and Tohru in Fruits Basket or the bickering main couple of Nisekoi, but Shikimori's main couple lacks conflict like that since they get along so well. If the anime doesn't want to bore its viewers, it can and should borrow from TONIKAWA's playbook.  TONIKAWA's main couple has zero friction, so the conflict was purely external, such as the main characters' apartment burning down in a freak accident and other characters testing or even doubting the validity of their marriage. To Nasa and Tsukasa, it was an \"us vs. the world\" conflict, and at this rate, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie might do the same. After all, many of the students doubt whether Izumi really deserves a stellar girlfriend like Shikimori, and Shikimori and Izumi are slightly insecure about their respective roles in the relationship. If other characters take advantage of this while serving as antagonists, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie will have all the conflict its viewers can handle. Challengers may soon appear, and Shikimori and Izumi must get ready to form a team to fend them off -- otherwise, their seemingly perfect relationship is doomed.

The latest in Chapter 350 is no exception.                  The following contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 350, \"Bound To A Fiery Fate\" by Horikoshi Kohei, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media   The Nomu from My Hero Academia aren\u2019t the series\u2019 main antagonists, but for most of the story, they formed a majority of the threat the League of Villains posed. Eraserhead's confrontation with Kurogiri revealed that these Nomu were actually reanimated corpses, a horrifying truth in and of itself, but the latest chapter revealed the process leading up to the creation of a Nomu might be even more sinister.  Along with the highly anticipated backstory of the League of Villains' Dabi, the latest MHA chapter gave some insight into how All For One conducted his affairs in the shadows. When Touya Todoroki was thought to have been lost to his flames, he was rescued by none other than All For One himself. Young Touya was then rehabilitated and finally awoke after three years to find himself in a strange facility surrounded by other children around his own age. RELATED: My Hero Academia's Dabi Looked Scarier Unfinished                 It's worth noting that none of Touya's peers in that facility seemed to be under any duress. They claimed that it was where they lived, and their mysterious masked caretaker informed Touya that they were to be his family as well from then on. One of the other children remarked that she'd arrived after Touya, implying that their little family continued to grow when All For One, or any of his associates, brought more children in. On the surface, it seemed like a paradise but a snide observation from an adult Dabi showed that it was anything but.  When Dr. Garaki presented Dabi with a High-End Nomu to test, Dabi remarked that turning him into a similar creature might be what All For One had in mind when the villain offered to restore his Cremation Quirk to full power. Garaki's inability to deny this was damning, and it inadvertently confirmed the terrifying reality of Nomus. A large number of the corpses required to make them probably came from these children. RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army                 Judging by the pattern of how All For One \"adopted\" both Shigaraki and Dabi, the other children must not have had comfortable past living situations. Essentially, All For One was preying on vulnerable children in society, enticing them with a myriad of rewards, including shelter or increased power, and then using them as the raw materials for his mindless soldiers. Since Dr. Garaki referred to Dabi and his other housemates as spares for Shigaraki, it's highly unlikely that either he or his master cared much for them past the viability of their Quirks.  The deception and murder of children is certainly not a line All For One is hesitant to cross, after all, Oboro Shirakumo was still in UA when All For One plotted the accident that took his life. Additionally, even Shigaraki who was given preferential treatment ended up being double-crossed when All For One stole his body and free will from him. It's no secret that All For One will stop at nothing to achieve his aims; The Nomu being reanimated corpses was enough to make him one of anime's most cruel villains but finding out that he would not spare even children sends him to an even higher dimension of evil.

The latest in Chapter 350 is no exception.                  The following contains spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter 350, \"Bound To A Fiery Fate\" by Horikoshi Kohei, Caleb Cook and John Hunt, available now in English from Viz Media   The Nomu from My Hero Academia aren\u2019t the series\u2019 main antagonists, but for most of the story, they formed a majority of the threat the League of Villains posed. Eraserhead's confrontation with Kurogiri revealed that these Nomu were actually reanimated corpses, a horrifying truth in and of itself, but the latest chapter revealed the process leading up to the creation of a Nomu might be even more sinister.  Along with the highly anticipated backstory of the League of Villains' Dabi, the latest MHA chapter gave some insight into how All For One conducted his affairs in the shadows. When Touya Todoroki was thought to have been lost to his flames, he was rescued by none other than All For One himself. Young Touya was then rehabilitated and finally awoke after three years to find himself in a strange facility surrounded by other children around his own age. RELATED: My Hero Academia's Dabi Looked Scarier Unfinished                 It's worth noting that none of Touya's peers in that facility seemed to be under any duress. They claimed that it was where they lived, and their mysterious masked caretaker informed Touya that they were to be his family as well from then on. One of the other children remarked that she'd arrived after Touya, implying that their little family continued to grow when All For One, or any of his associates, brought more children in. On the surface, it seemed like a paradise but a snide observation from an adult Dabi showed that it was anything but.  When Dr. Garaki presented Dabi with a High-End Nomu to test, Dabi remarked that turning him into a similar creature might be what All For One had in mind when the villain offered to restore his Cremation Quirk to full power. Garaki's inability to deny this was damning, and it inadvertently confirmed the terrifying reality of Nomus. A large number of the corpses required to make them probably came from these children. RELATED: Twice Was My Hero Academia's Hilarious & Tragic, One-Man Army                 Judging by the pattern of how All For One \"adopted\" both Shigaraki and Dabi, the other children must not have had comfortable past living situations. Essentially, All For One was preying on vulnerable children in society, enticing them with a myriad of rewards, including shelter or increased power, and then using them as the raw materials for his mindless soldiers. Since Dr. Garaki referred to Dabi and his other housemates as spares for Shigaraki, it's highly unlikely that either he or his master cared much for them past the viability of their Quirks.  The deception and murder of children is certainly not a line All For One is hesitant to cross, after all, Oboro Shirakumo was still in UA when All For One plotted the accident that took his life. Additionally, even Shigaraki who was given preferential treatment ended up being double-crossed when All For One stole his body and free will from him. It's no secret that All For One will stop at nothing to achieve his aims; The Nomu being reanimated corpses was enough to make him one of anime's most cruel villains but finding out that he would not spare even children sends him to an even higher dimension of evil.

Medina, 3858 and Fernando Kern's Below Sycamore #1 introduces readers to a fascinating world of drugs, demons and desperate people.                  In 2019, writers D.A. Medina and 3858 teamed up to create a play about demonic figures walking the earth and the cyclical nature of addiction. After the success of their their theatrical debut, Medina and 3858 recruited artist Fernando Kern and designer Zueoner to help them develop the play into a comic series. Soon, Below Sycamore attracted the attention of actor Danny Trejo and rapper Mr. Criminal, whose likenesses are featured prominently throughout the series. Below Sycamore #1 is an intriguing first issue that sets the stage for an exciting, poingant series.   Bellow Sycamore #1 follows two young men, Chucho and JD as they struggle to find their way in the world. The two friends are altar boys at their local church, but JD also works for a fearsome drug dealer, known as Grumpy. He does his best to find a balance between these two elements of his life, but as his situation becomes increasingly dangerous, it looks like he will have to make a difficult decision. As JD tries to navigate his perilous path, the two young men are followed by supernatural creatures who are hellbent on protecting them.  Related: AWA's The Joneses #1 Comic Review                Medina and 3858 introduce a wide variety of characters in this first issue. While Chucho and JD steal the show, the writers introduce the audience to priests, gangsters, addicts in recovery and corrupt police. This inclusive and expansive view of the neighborhood helps make Chucho's world feel lived in while laying the foundation for an intricate plot. The otherworldly elements of Below Sycamore #1 add a sense of mystery to the proceedings and contrast with the numerous Christian themes and images to build tension. Medina and 3858 include various opposing forces -- all revolving around drugs and addiction to present an empathetic and exciting exploration of the topic.   Kern's artwork helps Medina establish a fast pace bouncing between various characters without leaving the reader behind. His character designs are naturalistic but cartoony enough to be distinctive. His subtle, almost mundane costume designs make the supernatural characters stand out and appear particularly out of place against the otherwise normal background. Kern uses this sort of contrast masterfully throughout Below Sycamore #1. JD's body language changes drastically from when he is at church to when he is on the street. Similarly, scenes of violence are fast brutal interruptions of the otherwise calm, steady pace of the story.   Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                There's nothing particularly subtle about Below Sycamore #1. The comic definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, but Medina, 3858 and Kern work together to create a really compelling first issue. Their characters feel like normal, everyday people which makes the frightening situations they find themselves in all the more emotionally intense. Readers looking for solid crime fiction with a paranormal twist or a thoughtful exploration of addiction's impact on communities will be delighted by the first issue of Below Sycamore.

Medina, 3858 and Fernando Kern's Below Sycamore #1 introduces readers to a fascinating world of drugs, demons and desperate people.                  In 2019, writers D.A. Medina and 3858 teamed up to create a play about demonic figures walking the earth and the cyclical nature of addiction. After the success of their their theatrical debut, Medina and 3858 recruited artist Fernando Kern and designer Zueoner to help them develop the play into a comic series. Soon, Below Sycamore attracted the attention of actor Danny Trejo and rapper Mr. Criminal, whose likenesses are featured prominently throughout the series. Below Sycamore #1 is an intriguing first issue that sets the stage for an exciting, poingant series.   Bellow Sycamore #1 follows two young men, Chucho and JD as they struggle to find their way in the world. The two friends are altar boys at their local church, but JD also works for a fearsome drug dealer, known as Grumpy. He does his best to find a balance between these two elements of his life, but as his situation becomes increasingly dangerous, it looks like he will have to make a difficult decision. As JD tries to navigate his perilous path, the two young men are followed by supernatural creatures who are hellbent on protecting them.

While Chucho and JD steal the show, the writers introduce the audience to priests, gangsters, addicts in recovery and corrupt police. This inclusive and expansive view of the neighborhood helps make Chucho's world feel lived in while laying the foundation for an intricate plot. The otherworldly elements of Below Sycamore #1 add a sense of mystery to the proceedings and contrast with the numerous Christian themes and images to build tension. Medina and 3858 include various opposing forces -- all revolving around drugs and addiction to present an empathetic and exciting exploration of the topic.   Kern's artwork helps Medina establish a fast pace bouncing between various characters without leaving the reader behind. His character designs are naturalistic but cartoony enough to be distinctive. His subtle, almost mundane costume designs make the supernatural characters stand out and appear particularly out of place against the otherwise normal background. Kern uses this sort of contrast masterfully throughout Below Sycamore #1. JD's body language changes drastically from when he is at church to when he is on the street. Similarly, scenes of violence are fast brutal interruptions of the otherwise calm, steady pace of the story.   Related: Vault's West of Sundown #1 Comic Review                There's nothing particularly subtle about Below Sycamore #1. The comic definitely wears its heart on its sleeve, but Medina, 3858 and Kern work together to create a really compelling first issue. Their characters feel like normal, everyday people which makes the frightening situations they find themselves in all the more emotionally intense. Readers looking for solid crime fiction with a paranormal twist or a thoughtful exploration of addiction's impact on communities will be delighted by the first issue of Below Sycamore.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, \"My Girlfriend is Super Cute,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season introduces a brand-new high school rom-com series titled Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This is a story of the gentle shonen lead Izumi and his popular, pink-haired girlfriend Shikimori, who can do anything she sets her mind to. Izumi appears happy in the relationship in Episode 1, but he's got a little problem.  Izumi is hopelessly clumsy, to the point his parents warn him about every hazard one could think of when walking to school. All throughout the premiere, Shikimori must defend her accident-prone boyfriend from harm, putting an amusing twist on the shojo stereotype of a clumsy female lead who literally falls into her male lover's arms. The tables have been turned. RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                The premiere episode of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie introduces Izumi first, quickly establishing him as a kind but helpless boy who would get eaten alive if it weren't for his girlfriend Shikimori. Even Izumi's parents count on her to protect their son, making it clear this situation is nothing new. It seems, he has always been clumsy and vulnerable, so gaining Shikimori as his girlfriend is a serious boon.  This also establishes the main couple's power dynamic, with Shikimori being the powerful one and Izumi being the one who is simply happy to be there. Traditionally the male character is the stronger and more assertive, but recent anime series have tinkered with the formula by swapping the characters around, and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie continues this. The story's very title alludes to it as well, pointing out that the gorgeous Shikimori is not only attractive -- she has serious skill and a strong will to match. On one hand, making Izumi so gentle and helpless might frustrate some fans who are more used to gung-ho shonen leads such as Kurosaki Ichigo, Uzumaki Naruto and Asta the swordsman, but recent anime such as Shikimori offer alternatives with male leads who are defined more by compassion and generosity instead, a move that may appeal to the \"female gaze.\" This broadens the market appeal for shonen anime, and provides respite from an endless parade of \"I'll kick your butt\" meathead leads. It's not that strong male leads are unappealing or obsolete, but that archetype needs a chance to cool off and let other models of a male protagonist take the spotlight. That is the case with the clumsy but lovable Izumi.  RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Other events in Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episode 1 continue to reinforce this theme. While many anime depict a charmingly clumsy female who falls neatly into her male lover's arms, Shikimori reverses that -- and the characters themselves know it. Shikimori soon establishes herself as one of the spring season's best girls with her balance of good looks, a kind heart and a protective streak, almost acting like Izumi's big sister. She won't trip and fall into some hunk's arms -- more likely Izumi will trip and fall into her arms, and no doubt many fans are eager to see that happen. Strong female leads are more popular and prominent than ever, and a humorous series like Shikimori is bound to push the envelope as much as it can for laughs, including twisting old clich\u00e9s into something new.  An example of this self-awareness takes place in a bowling alley. The clumsy Izumi can't throw a ball straight to save his life, but Shikimori sure can, and her female friends urge her to imitate his clumsiness. The idea is that by being a typical \"clumsy shojo girl,\" Shikimori will be cute and endearing in Izumi's eyes. Then Izumi cheers her on, so she feels empowered enough to score a perfect game instead. Shikimori identifies greatly with being strong, confident and cool; trying to be \"cute and clumsy\" simply isn't her thing. That should set the character's tone as Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie continues.

The following contains spoilers for Episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, \"My Girlfriend is Super Cute,\" now streaming on Crunchyroll.   The spring 2022 anime season introduces a brand-new high school rom-com series titled Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This is a story of the gentle shonen lead Izumi and his popular, pink-haired girlfriend Shikimori, who can do anything she sets her mind to. Izumi appears happy in the relationship in Episode 1, but he's got a little problem.  Izumi is hopelessly clumsy, to the point his parents warn him about every hazard one could think of when walking to school. All throughout the premiere, Shikimori must defend her accident-prone boyfriend from harm, putting an amusing twist on the shojo stereotype of a clumsy female lead who literally falls into her male lover's arms. The tables have been turned. RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                The premiere episode of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie introduces Izumi first, quickly establishing him as a kind but helpless boy who would get eaten alive if it weren't for his girlfriend Shikimori. Even Izumi's parents count on her to protect their son, making it clear this situation is nothing new. It seems, he has always been clumsy and vulnerable, so gaining Shikimori as his girlfriend is a serious boon.  This also establishes the main couple's power dynamic, with Shikimori being the powerful one and Izumi being the one who is simply happy to be there. Traditionally the male character is the stronger and more assertive, but recent anime series have tinkered with the formula by swapping the characters around, and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie continues this. The story's very title alludes to it as well, pointing out that the gorgeous Shikimori is not only attractive -- she has serious skill and a strong will to match. On one hand, making Izumi so gentle and helpless might frustrate some fans who are more used to gung-ho shonen leads such as Kurosaki Ichigo, Uzumaki Naruto and Asta the swordsman, but recent anime such as Shikimori offer alternatives with male leads who are defined more by compassion and generosity instead, a move that may appeal to the \"female gaze.\" This broadens the market appeal for shonen anime, and provides respite from an endless parade of \"I'll kick your butt\" meathead leads. It's not that strong male leads are unappealing or obsolete, but that archetype needs a chance to cool off and let other models of a male protagonist take the spotlight. That is the case with the clumsy but lovable Izumi.  RELATED: Aharen-San Episode 2 Showcases Aharen Raina's Sweet, Caring Side                Other events in Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episode 1 continue to reinforce this theme. While many anime depict a charmingly clumsy female who falls neatly into her male lover's arms, Shikimori reverses that -- and the characters themselves know it. Shikimori soon establishes herself as one of the spring season's best girls with her balance of good looks, a kind heart and a protective streak, almost acting like Izumi's big sister. She won't trip and fall into some hunk's arms -- more likely Izumi will trip and fall into her arms, and no doubt many fans are eager to see that happen. Strong female leads are more popular and prominent than ever, and a humorous series like Shikimori is bound to push the envelope as much as it can for laughs, including twisting old clich\u00e9s into something new.  An example of this self-awareness takes place in a bowling alley. The clumsy Izumi can't throw a ball straight to save his life, but Shikimori sure can, and her female friends urge her to imitate his clumsiness. The idea is that by being a typical \"clumsy shojo girl,\" Shikimori will be cute and endearing in Izumi's eyes. Then Izumi cheers her on, so she feels empowered enough to score a perfect game instead. Shikimori identifies greatly with being strong, confident and cool; trying to be \"cute and clumsy\" simply isn't her thing. That should set the character's tone as Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie continues.

One Piece Film: Red released new art of Red-Haired Shanks and two of the movie's new characters.  The new look at the movie's cast was revealed through Toei Animation's official Twitter account, which has been releasing fully-colored art of Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates' new costumes over the last few weeks. The latest art drop showcases Red-Haired Shanks, who looks even more buff than usual, and two of the movie's new characters: Uta, a young singer who has been revealed to be Shanks' long lost daughter, and a mysterious new character named Gordon. RELATED: One Piece, Digimon Anime End Month-Long Hiatus Due to Hacking Incident          The art was revealed online after the release of the newest trailer for the upcoming movie, which revealed the previously unknown connection between Shanks and Uta. The trailer also featured new footage of Luffy fighting in his new costume. The new movie tells the story of the Straw Hat Pirates as they travel to a new island, which is hosting a music festival.  Production on the new film is being supervised by the manga's original creator, Eiichiro Oda. According to Oda, the movie was inspired by his desire to add a new female character to the series' cast, as according to him, \"I am tired of drawing legendary old grandpas in movies.\" The script for the new movie is being penned by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, who previously wrote One Piece Film: Gold, and is being directed by Code Geass' Goro Taniguchi. The anime series' voice cast will reprise their roles for the movie. RELATED: Did One Piece Just Reveal the Secret of Marijoa's Treasure?  Fans of the inspirational pirate captain have more than the new movie to look forward to, as Netflix recently confirmed that Red-Haired Shanks will also appear in its upcoming live-action reboot of the series. Actor Peter Gadoit, who played Cyrus in ABC's Once Upon A Time in Wonderland, will portray the pirate captain. The live-action reboot is currently filming in Cape Town, South Africa. Shanks is also featured in One Piece's new 25th anniversary logo, which looks back at the moment when he gave a young Luffy his iconic straw hat. The logo will be featured on all of the franchise's new releases throughout 2022. Oda's beloved pirate adventure first set sail in 1997, and has since become the best-selling manga series in history, with over half-a-billion copies in circulation worldwide.  A selection of earlier One Piece anime seasons and movies are available for streaming on Netflix. The entire anime is also available for streaming on Crunchyroll. One Piece Film: Red is scheduled to premiere in Japan this August. An international release date for the movie has yet to be announced.

One Piece Film: Red released new art of Red-Haired Shanks and two of the movie's new characters.  The new look at the movie's cast was revealed through Toei Animation's official Twitter account, which has been releasing fully-colored art of Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates' new costumes over the last few weeks. The latest art drop showcases Red-Haired Shanks, who looks even more buff than usual, and two of the movie's new characters: Uta, a young singer who has been revealed to be Shanks' long lost daughter, and a mysterious new character named Gordon. RELATED: One Piece, Digimon Anime End Month-Long Hiatus Due to Hacking Incident          The art was revealed online after the release of the newest trailer for the upcoming movie, which revealed the previously unknown connection between Shanks and Uta. The trailer also featured new footage of Luffy fighting in his new costume. The new movie tells the story of the Straw Hat Pirates as they travel to a new island, which is hosting a music festival.  Production on the new film is being supervised by the manga's original creator, Eiichiro Oda. According to Oda, the movie was inspired by his desire to add a new female character to the series' cast, as according to him, \"I am tired of drawing legendary old grandpas in movies.\" The script for the new movie is being penned by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, who previously wrote One Piece Film: Gold, and is being directed by Code Geass' Goro Taniguchi. The anime series' voice cast will reprise their roles for the movie. RELATED: Did One Piece Just Reveal the Secret of Marijoa's Treasure?  Fans of the inspirational pirate captain have more than the new movie to look forward to, as Netflix recently confirmed that Red-Haired Shanks will also appear in its upcoming live-action reboot of the series. Actor Peter Gadoit, who played Cyrus in ABC's Once Upon A Time in Wonderland, will portray the pirate captain. The live-action reboot is currently filming in Cape Town, South Africa. Shanks is also featured in One Piece's new 25th anniversary logo, which looks back at the moment when he gave a young Luffy his iconic straw hat. The logo will be featured on all of the franchise's new releases throughout 2022. Oda's beloved pirate adventure first set sail in 1997, and has since become the best-selling manga series in history, with over half-a-billion copies in circulation worldwide.  A selection of earlier One Piece anime seasons and movies are available for streaming on Netflix. The entire anime is also available for streaming on Crunchyroll. One Piece Film: Red is scheduled to premiere in Japan this August. An international release date for the movie has yet to be announced.

Suicide Squad #14 (2022)   Writer  Dennis Hopeless    Artist  Eduardo Pansica, Julio Ferreira, Dexter Soy    Letterer  Wes Abbot    Publisher  DC Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-05    Colorist  Jeremiah Skipper, Peter Pantazis      The War for Earth-3 has come to an end and opened a new chapter for the rebel hero-villains of the Suicide Squad. Written by Dennis Hopeless, with visuals from artist Eduardo Pansica, J\u00falio Ferreira, and Dexter Soy, colors by Jeremiah Skipper and Peter Pantazis, and letters by Wes Abbot, Suicide Squad #14 brings to an end a promising arc of a usually thrilling series, but with a few twists. This issue, entitled \"Defunded - Part 1,\" picks up where the last issue left off after Amanda Waller's victory over the Evil Justice League of Earth-3 with the reluctant assistance of the Suicide Squad.  Victory is short-lived, however. Back in their own dimension, the Squad is in shambles. Two members died in battle, with Talon dying soon after, Culebra is left without a body, Belle Reve has been destroyed, Amanda Waller is M.I.A., and the Task Force X is disbanded. The Squad finds themselves without purpose or funding, though at least they got to keep Bloodsport and his brothers. What's a ragtag team of misfit heroes to do now? Their first mission is to reconvene, then they must find new funding, at any cost. Rick Flag has a few ideas on how to get it. Related: The X-Men's Oldest Rivals Created a Marvel Suicide Squad Years Before the Thunderbolts                 Suicide Squad is a franchise known for its reckless abandon, chaos, dark humor, and disregard for convention, matching the wild-card attitudes of its ragtag cast of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and misfits. Everything from victories and losses to brutal deaths and mutilations has a wicked sense of comedy to them. Most of the time, it's effective. However, Suicide Squad #14 doesn't quite match this energy. In this series, the last 13 issues have focused on the crossover event, the War for Earth-3. It was a high-stakes battle with plenty of bloodshed, casualties, and drama that ended abruptly. This is a recurring problem for Suicide Squad #14. Plots that were previously built up, character arcs that were being developed, and new twists for the story are all dropped abruptly and with little to no warning or resolution. Belle Reve's destruction is sudden and feels almost aimless, doing nothing more than scattering the Squad a little further -- a problem that is resolved pretty quickly. Talon's death is a mere hand wave and lacks the impact it could have had, despite his final tender moment with Culebra, which Ambug Bug so kindly elaborates on for the audience's benefit.  This sort of irreverence is par for the course for the Suicide Squad, which has reveled in its subversive take on superheroes and the conventions of the DC Comics canon. However, it fails here because the issue loses much of its narrative momentum immediately afterward, save for a few scenes that, while action-filled and fun, feel disjointed. Related: Suicide Squad's Bloodsport is Trying to Solve a Multiversal Mystery                Up to this point, writer Dennis Hopeless has captured the tone and pacing of the Suicide Squad nicely; however, this issue is lacking in comparison because the previous arc dropped right as it was picking up steam. Suicide Squad #14 feels less like another chapter in a story and more like a filler issue between two arcs. The issue focuses on picking up the pieces of the Earth-3 storyline and scrambling to tie loose ends, which can be frustrating to read.  However, Suicide Squad #14 isn't without a few draws. There are glimmers of that signature twisted humor that makes the series so enjoyable. Ambush Bug is the standout of the cast for his carefree, naive attitude, quick wit, and distinctive speech patterns. His chemistry with Peacemaker, in all his surly and violent glory, steals the show. The visuals shine here as well, with the line art having a rough, almost unfinished quality with pulpy, grimy textures in the colors. Suicide Squad #14 doesn't feel like a conclusion to an arc but rather a bridge between two stories -- one that can be difficult for some readers to cross without some sense of disappointment. However, the ending scene and a promising tease of Lex Luthor's involvement in the story give readers plenty of incentive to make their way to the other side.

Suicide Squad #14 (2022)   Writer  Dennis Hopeless    Artist  Eduardo Pansica, Julio Ferreira, Dexter Soy    Letterer  Wes Abbot    Publisher  DC Comics    Price  3.99    Release Date  2022-04-05    Colorist  Jeremiah Skipper, Peter Pantazis      The War for Earth-3 has come to an end and opened a new chapter for the rebel hero-villains of the Suicide Squad. Written by Dennis Hopeless, with visuals from artist Eduardo Pansica, J\u00falio Ferreira, and Dexter Soy, colors by Jeremiah Skipper and Peter Pantazis, and letters by Wes Abbot, Suicide Squad #14 brings to an end a promising arc of a usually thrilling series, but with a few twists. This issue, entitled \"Defunded - Part 1,\" picks up where the last issue left off after Amanda Waller's victory over the Evil Justice League of Earth-3 with the reluctant assistance of the Suicide Squad.  Victory is short-lived, however. Back in their own dimension, the Squad is in shambles. Two members died in battle, with Talon dying soon after, Culebra is left without a body, Belle Reve has been destroyed, Amanda Waller is M.I.A., and the Task Force X is disbanded. The Squad finds themselves without purpose or funding, though at least they got to keep Bloodsport and his brothers. What's a ragtag team of misfit heroes to do now? Their first mission is to reconvene, then they must find new funding, at any cost. Rick Flag has a few ideas on how to get it. Related: The X-Men's Oldest Rivals Created a Marvel Suicide Squad Years Before the Thunderbolts                 Suicide Squad is a franchise known for its reckless abandon, chaos, dark humor, and disregard for convention, matching the wild-card attitudes of its ragtag cast of anti-heroes, anti-villains, and misfits. Everything from victories and losses to brutal deaths and mutilations has a wicked sense of comedy to them. Most of the time, it's effective. However, Suicide Squad #14 doesn't quite match this energy. In this series, the last 13 issues have focused on the crossover event, the War for Earth-3. It was a high-stakes battle with plenty of bloodshed, casualties, and drama that ended abruptly. This is a recurring problem for Suicide Squad #14. Plots that were previously built up, character arcs that were being developed, and new twists for the story are all dropped abruptly and with little to no warning or resolution. Belle Reve's destruction is sudden and feels almost aimless, doing nothing more than scattering the Squad a little further -- a problem that is resolved pretty quickly. Talon's death is a mere hand wave and lacks the impact it could have had, despite his final tender moment with Culebra, which Ambug Bug so kindly elaborates on for the audience's benefit.  This sort of irreverence is par for the course for the Suicide Squad, which has reveled in its subversive take on superheroes and the conventions of the DC Comics canon. However, it fails here because the issue loses much of its narrative momentum immediately afterward, save for a few scenes that, while action-filled and fun, feel disjointed. Related: Suicide Squad's Bloodsport is Trying to Solve a Multiversal Mystery                Up to this point, writer Dennis Hopeless has captured the tone and pacing of the Suicide Squad nicely; however, this issue is lacking in comparison because the previous arc dropped right as it was picking up steam. Suicide Squad #14 feels less like another chapter in a story and more like a filler issue between two arcs. The issue focuses on picking up the pieces of the Earth-3 storyline and scrambling to tie loose ends, which can be frustrating to read.  However, Suicide Squad #14 isn't without a few draws. There are glimmers of that signature twisted humor that makes the series so enjoyable. Ambush Bug is the standout of the cast for his carefree, naive attitude, quick wit, and distinctive speech patterns. His chemistry with Peacemaker, in all his surly and violent glory, steals the show. The visuals shine here as well, with the line art having a rough, almost unfinished quality with pulpy, grimy textures in the colors. Suicide Squad #14 doesn't feel like a conclusion to an arc but rather a bridge between two stories -- one that can be difficult for some readers to cross without some sense of disappointment. However, the ending scene and a promising tease of Lex Luthor's involvement in the story give readers plenty of incentive to make their way to the other side.

Here are all their previous meetings in One-Punch Man.                  The following contains spoilers for Chapter 159 of One-Punch Man, \"Source of Anxiety,\" by One, Yusuke Murata, John Werry and James Gaubatz, available in English via Viz Media.   Fans of One-Punch Man have long seen similarities in Garo and Saitama. Garo's drive for power and exponential growth have made many wonder if the Hero Hunter will one day be able to match the Bald Cape's power level, which only adds further hype for future meetings. While their most recent encounter is the most exciting yet, it is not the first time they've exchanged blows.  Garo already has a history of assaulting Saitama, though none of his attacks have actually hurt the hero. Saitama is also yet to exert any effort in fending off the Hero Hunter. Here is every moment these two have made contact so far in One-Punch Man. RELATED:How One Piece's Earlier Arcs Prove Luffy Is the Best User of His Devil Fruit          Garo Interrupts Saitama While Shopping for a Wig                 After learning of a possible cash prize, Saitama agreed to take part in a martial arts competition in Charanko's stead. He then started looking for a wig to make his disguise more convincing. Meanwhile, Garo was walking in the Entertainment District when he saw a particular member of the Hero Association bragging about his status to some ladies. When the poor guy offered to introduce the girls to Sweet Mask, Garo appeared and knocked him out. That was when Saitama appeared.  Saitama commented about finding the right one after looking everywhere, which Garo assumed to be in reference to him. Thinking the Bald Cape was a hero who was keeping an eye on him, the Hero Hunter launched a quick hand chop. The attack was strong enough to nail Saitama to the ground -- however, annoyed by the sudden interruption of his shopping, Saitama returned the same blow and knocked out Garo. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died          Garo Tries to Assault The Strongest Man                 Saitama and Garo's second meeting in One-Punch Man came when the Bald Cape protected King from the Hero Hunter's attack. Back then Saitama was opening up to King about his woes, discussing the lack of excitement that accompanied being unparalleled. While King initially thought Saitama was referring to his hair, he did offer his friend some meaningful advice -- which he stole from some manga.  At that time, Garo was suffering from the injuries he'd sustained from fighting Watchdog Man. Garo spotted King and Saitama walking together but his eyes were focused on the former, whom he wanted to hunt. He claimed to not feel any pain and rushed toward King -- but before he could strike, Saitama had already kicked Garo into a wall. RELATED:One-Punch Man: A Dark & Twisted Backstory Led to Genos Becoming a Cyborg          Garo Dines and Dashes - and So Does Saitama                 Garo and Saitama's third meeting is more comedic than the first two. Saitama had just finished eating when he realized he didn't have his wallet with him. Just as he was contemplating his life decisions, Blizzard came in to ask him to join her group. Saitama had other plans, however; he ordered another plate of fries and offered it to Blizzard, which the latter gratefully accepted. As if on cue, the announcement of Garo dining and dashing came. Saitama left within a heartbeat in pursuit of Garo, leaving Blizzard to pay the bill.  Garo witnessed Tareo being bullied and decided to help the kid, allowing Saitama to catch up to him. But instead of capturing Garo, the Bald Cape simply let him off with a warning. The Hero Hunter took this as the hero pitying him, so he went to punch Saitama. Afraid of getting in trouble for being an accomplice, Saitama reflexively punched the Hero Hunter, once again knocking him out. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task          Garo and Saitama's Most-Anticipated Battle Yet                 Garo and Saitama's most recent meeting in One-Punch Man came when they took out Centisennin and Evil Ocean Water respectively. Saitama went to Garo, thinking he was the Monster King. Garo indeed introduced himself as a monster and went on to rant about being the absolute evil. The Bald Cape ignored him, thinking he wasn't really a monster. Garo, ticked by Saitama's lack of care, launched a sneak attack -- only to be sent flying by Saitama's reflexive punch.

Meanwhile, Garo was walking in the Entertainment District when he saw a particular member of the Hero Association bragging about his status to some ladies. When the poor guy offered to introduce the girls to Sweet Mask, Garo appeared and knocked him out. That was when Saitama appeared.  Saitama commented about finding the right one after looking everywhere, which Garo assumed to be in reference to him. Thinking the Bald Cape was a hero who was keeping an eye on him, the Hero Hunter launched a quick hand chop. The attack was strong enough to nail Saitama to the ground -- however, annoyed by the sudden interruption of his shopping, Saitama returned the same blow and knocked out Garo. RELATED:Every Giant-Centipede Monster in One-Punch Man (So Far) - and How They Died          Garo Tries to Assault The Strongest Man                 Saitama and Garo's second meeting in One-Punch Man came when the Bald Cape protected King from the Hero Hunter's attack. Back then Saitama was opening up to King about his woes, discussing the lack of excitement that accompanied being unparalleled. While King initially thought Saitama was referring to his hair, he did offer his friend some meaningful advice -- which he stole from some manga.  At that time, Garo was suffering from the injuries he'd sustained from fighting Watchdog Man. Garo spotted King and Saitama walking together but his eyes were focused on the former, whom he wanted to hunt. He claimed to not feel any pain and rushed toward King -- but before he could strike, Saitama had already kicked Garo into a wall. RELATED:One-Punch Man: A Dark & Twisted Backstory Led to Genos Becoming a Cyborg          Garo Dines and Dashes - and So Does Saitama                 Garo and Saitama's third meeting is more comedic than the first two. Saitama had just finished eating when he realized he didn't have his wallet with him. Just as he was contemplating his life decisions, Blizzard came in to ask him to join her group. Saitama had other plans, however; he ordered another plate of fries and offered it to Blizzard, which the latter gratefully accepted. As if on cue, the announcement of Garo dining and dashing came. Saitama left within a heartbeat in pursuit of Garo, leaving Blizzard to pay the bill.  Garo witnessed Tareo being bullied and decided to help the kid, allowing Saitama to catch up to him. But instead of capturing Garo, the Bald Cape simply let him off with a warning. The Hero Hunter took this as the hero pitying him, so he went to punch Saitama. Afraid of getting in trouble for being an accomplice, Saitama reflexively punched the Hero Hunter, once again knocking him out. RELATED:One-Punch Man: The Hero Association's Strongest Fighter Begins a Godly Task          Garo and Saitama's Most-Anticipated Battle Yet                 Garo and Saitama's most recent meeting in One-Punch Man came when they took out Centisennin and Evil Ocean Water respectively. Saitama went to Garo, thinking he was the Monster King. Garo indeed introduced himself as a monster and went on to rant about being the absolute evil. The Bald Cape ignored him, thinking he wasn't really a monster. Garo, ticked by Saitama's lack of care, launched a sneak attack -- only to be sent flying by Saitama's reflexive punch.

Home Comics Comic Book Reviews Image Comics' Blood-Stained Teeth #1 Comic Review    Image Comics' Blood-Stained Teeth #1 Comic Review  By Dustin Holland Published 17 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Christian Ward and Patric Reynolds' Blood-Stained Teeth #1 is a beautifully drawn,  action-packed vampire story.                 Most comics fans are most likely familiar with Christian Ward as an artist. His art brought life to series like G. Willow Wilson's Invisible Kingdom and Matt Fraction's ODY-C. Readers can look forward to more of his art in the upcoming Aquaman: Andromeda, but for now, Ward is taking a moment to write a story of his own. He is joined by artist Patric Reynolds, colorist Heather Moore and letterer Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou to present Blood-Stained Teeth #1, a thrilling vampire crime comic due out April 27 from Image Comics.  Blood-Stained Teeth #1 follows an entrepreneurial vampire named Atticus Sloane. Atticus turns humans into vampires for a price. This business has afforded him a life of luxury, but it has also drawn the attention and anger of other first-born vampires, who look down on humans who become vampires. When high-ranking members of the vampire community try to bully Atticus into retiring from his grisly line of work, the vampire is forced into a dangerous situation. Related: Below Sycamore #1 Comic Review                Ward wastes no time jumping into the vicious world of vampires in Blood-Stained Teeth #1. Atticus turns a woman into a vampire on the very first page, and things only get wilder from there. Ward's fast pace helps set a punchy, exciting tone for the series. But despite the non-stop nature of this first issue, he still manages to build a complex world. The social hierarchy of first-born vampires and \"sips,\" who become vampires after being bitten, is explained briefly but clearly. Ward capitalizes on the audience's familiarity with the vampire mythos by adding his own twist to the genre without spending too much time on the exposition.  Reynolds' art captures the thrilling tone of Blood-Stained Teeth perfectly. He includes iconic horror aesthetics that fans will associate with vampires while adding his own distinct style to each character. Reynolds' style adds a modern element to the ancient characters and grounds the proceedings in contemporary times. Each page seems designed to throw the reader into a disorienting world without distracting from the narrative. Reynolds adds a brutality to each action scene and every landscape to reinforce the harsh, but entertaining tone of Ward's writing. Related: Image Comics' Radiant Red #2 Comic Review                  Heather Moore's colors add vitality and a sense of motion to every panel. She bathes Reynolds' inks in a sea of neon that helps to amplify the comic's pace. Moore makes the world of Blood-Stained Teeth bright and poppy, without distracting from the fact that it's all taking place in the middle of the night. It is sometimes difficult whether or not some of the fascinating textures in these pages originate from Moore's colors or Reynolds' drawing, but together the two have created some unforgettable images. Blood-Stained Teeth #1 lays the foundation for a thrilling crime drama. Ward and Reynolds combine horror and action to create a fun first issue that utilizes classic archetypes while being remarkably unique. The entire creative team works together to craft a truly striking first issue. Every page stands alone as a work of art, and the story is as fun as any vampire narrative in recent memory.

By Paige Villacin Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Despite being such a popular genre, why do so few magical girl anime break into the mainstream of the western market?                  The Magical Girl genre has long since become one of many staples associated with anime -- so much so that it's frequently parodied not just by other anime, but by western cartoons as well. Despite this, very few magical girl series have actually broken through the mainstream. It certainly isn\u2019t because the industry has been producing less magical girl anime, but rather, western publishers seem to be averse to localizing most of them.  This is a problem that\u2019s perpetuated not just in anime, but the animation industry as a whole for many years. Shows with a male demographic will almost always receive preference over those targeted at girls. The few that are made with a female demographic in mind tend to go out of their way to appeal to a male audience as well, such as changing the title to give less focus on the female protagonist (ie: changing Miraculous Ladybug to The Adventures of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir) or elevating a male character to a secondary protagonist position. RELATED: From Arina Tanemura to Clamp: Influential Shojo Artists of the Early 2000s                  One of the best-known anime that takes the above practice to heart is Cardcaptor Sakura. When it was first released in English in the west, its title was changed to Cardcaptors. This rename accomplished two things: it put less focus on the female protagonist, and it gave more importance to a male character. In the original series, Sakura is the only character to ever receive the title of \u201cCardcaptor\u201d. In Nelvana\u2019s English dub, it isn\u2019t just Sakura who receives this title, but Syaoran (renamed Lee in the dub) as well. Lee is also elevated from supporting character to co-protagonist status, again to appeal to the male demographic. His romance with Sakura is completely scrapped, and any episodes that focused on the series' more slice-of-life aspects were completely removed in favor of more action-based storylines. In short, Nelvana repackaged this classic shoujo anime into a shounen series with a female lead.  Every few years, popular children\u2019s anime geared toward boys will receive a new iteration featuring an entirely new cast. Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade are some of the more popular ones that come to mind. Many of these have made their way to broadcast networks in the west -- in fact, the latest iteration of Beyblade is currently airing on Disney XD. The same treatment has been given to many popular children\u2019s anime aimed at girls as well, ranging from magical girl anime to idol anime. However, most of these long-running franchises have never made their way to western television sets.  RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover                 It would be understandable if such programs were not successful, but many of these have proved popular enough to continue running for several decades. One prime example is Pretty Cure, a long-running magical girl anime that has been around for over 20 years. It\u2019s one of Toei Animation\u2019s most popular properties, rivaling even Sailor Moon in terms of cultural impact in its home country. Despite its massive success, only two of the series within this storied franchise have ever been picked up for English localization.  The original series, Futari Wa Pretty Cure, was picked up by several companies including Funimation, 4Kids and YTV. Only YTV has ever broadcast the show on television, but because it is a Canadian broadcasting channel, this means Futari Wa Pretty Cure was never shown in the US. It is, however, still available for streaming on Prime Video and Hulu. Doki Doki Pretty Cure was picked up by Hasbro and dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. It was renamed to the slightly more aggressive Glitter Force and is currently available for streaming on Netflix. Like most children\u2019s anime from the early 2000s, the story was heavily cut and edited to remove any explicit references to Japanese culture as well as material deemed too \u201cmature\u201d for its target audience, such as references to death. As of this writing, this was the last Pretty Cure anime to be officially dubbed in English. While Crunchyroll has started streaming the newer entries in the franchise, no other companies have made any attempts to dub or market it to the western audience.  RELATED: Lady Gaga, Crunchyroll Team Up for New Apparel Collection                 While shoujo anime have not had as much trouble finding an audience in the west, one would be hard-pressed to find such shows airing on network television. Toonami has aired a few female-led shows in the past, but none were explicitly made with a female audience in mind. After the success of Sailor Moon, 4Kids made a few attempts to tap into the magical girl market by picking up Tokyo Mew Mew, or Mew Mew Power as it\u2019s known in the west. It found some level of success, but not nearly to the same degree as Sailor Moon. A further attempt was made with yet another Toei Animation property, Ojamajo Doremi, which predictably received a new westernized name: Magical Doremi. It proved even less successful and suffered from consistently low ratings. 4Kids never finished airing the entire series, with the last 25 episodes going straight to the network\u2019s website instead. 4Kids also gained the rights to Futari Wa Pretty Cure, but it never released any episodes before the series was eventually picked up by another distributor.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 The failure of such anime can be attributed to a number of things -- none of which can be faulted to the shows themselves, but rather, mismanagement on the part of the companies distributing them. Magical Doremi aired at 7:30 am, too early in the morning for most kids to want to tune in on a Saturday. Cardcaptors received heavy backlash from fans of the original source material. When Pioneer gained the rights to distribute the original series on home video -- completely unedited and uncut in the original Japanese dub -- the sub-only DVDs outsold the dub-only DVDs by more than 10,000 units. Likewise, many long-time Pretty Cure fans responded negatively to Hasbro\u2019s decisions to edit and westernize the English dub for Glitter Force -- a practice that in this day and age is no longer considered acceptable. Even the English dubs for the likes of Beyblade keep the original Japanese names and references intact.  It truly is a shame that more companies aren\u2019t willing to put more time and interest in anime aimed at young girls. If they would simply put the same amount of effort into marketing such shows the way they do with Bakugan or Pok\u00e9mon, there\u2019s definite success to be had. There\u2019s a plethora of magical girl and shoujo anime that will never be exported as a result.

Why Is It So Hard to Market Magical Girl Anime in the US?  By Paige Villacin Published 22 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Despite being such a popular genre, why do so few magical girl anime break into the mainstream of the western market?                  The Magical Girl genre has long since become one of many staples associated with anime -- so much so that it's frequently parodied not just by other anime, but by western cartoons as well. Despite this, very few magical girl series have actually broken through the mainstream. It certainly isn\u2019t because the industry has been producing less magical girl anime, but rather, western publishers seem to be averse to localizing most of them.  This is a problem that\u2019s perpetuated not just in anime, but the animation industry as a whole for many years. Shows with a male demographic will almost always receive preference over those targeted at girls. The few that are made with a female demographic in mind tend to go out of their way to appeal to a male audience as well, such as changing the title to give less focus on the female protagonist (ie: changing Miraculous Ladybug to The Adventures of Miraculous Ladybug and Cat Noir) or elevating a male character to a secondary protagonist position. RELATED: From Arina Tanemura to Clamp: Influential Shojo Artists of the Early 2000s                  One of the best-known anime that takes the above practice to heart is Cardcaptor Sakura. When it was first released in English in the west, its title was changed to Cardcaptors. This rename accomplished two things: it put less focus on the female protagonist, and it gave more importance to a male character. In the original series, Sakura is the only character to ever receive the title of \u201cCardcaptor\u201d. In Nelvana\u2019s English dub, it isn\u2019t just Sakura who receives this title, but Syaoran (renamed Lee in the dub) as well. Lee is also elevated from supporting character to co-protagonist status, again to appeal to the male demographic. His romance with Sakura is completely scrapped, and any episodes that focused on the series' more slice-of-life aspects were completely removed in favor of more action-based storylines. In short, Nelvana repackaged this classic shoujo anime into a shounen series with a female lead.  Every few years, popular children\u2019s anime geared toward boys will receive a new iteration featuring an entirely new cast. Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade are some of the more popular ones that come to mind. Many of these have made their way to broadcast networks in the west -- in fact, the latest iteration of Beyblade is currently airing on Disney XD. The same treatment has been given to many popular children\u2019s anime aimed at girls as well, ranging from magical girl anime to idol anime. However, most of these long-running franchises have never made their way to western television sets.  RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover                 It would be understandable if such programs were not successful, but many of these have proved popular enough to continue running for several decades. One prime example is Pretty Cure, a long-running magical girl anime that has been around for over 20 years. It\u2019s one of Toei Animation\u2019s most popular properties, rivaling even Sailor Moon in terms of cultural impact in its home country. Despite its massive success, only two of the series within this storied franchise have ever been picked up for English localization.  The original series, Futari Wa Pretty Cure, was picked up by several companies including Funimation, 4Kids and YTV. Only YTV has ever broadcast the show on television, but because it is a Canadian broadcasting channel, this means Futari Wa Pretty Cure was never shown in the US. It is, however, still available for streaming on Prime Video and Hulu. Doki Doki Pretty Cure was picked up by Hasbro and dubbed by Bang Zoom! Entertainment. It was renamed to the slightly more aggressive Glitter Force and is currently available for streaming on Netflix. Like most children\u2019s anime from the early 2000s, the story was heavily cut and edited to remove any explicit references to Japanese culture as well as material deemed too \u201cmature\u201d for its target audience, such as references to death. As of this writing, this was the last Pretty Cure anime to be officially dubbed in English. While Crunchyroll has started streaming the newer entries in the franchise, no other companies have made any attempts to dub or market it to the western audience.  RELATED: Lady Gaga, Crunchyroll Team Up for New Apparel Collection                 While shoujo anime have not had as much trouble finding an audience in the west, one would be hard-pressed to find such shows airing on network television. Toonami has aired a few female-led shows in the past, but none were explicitly made with a female audience in mind. After the success of Sailor Moon, 4Kids made a few attempts to tap into the magical girl market by picking up Tokyo Mew Mew, or Mew Mew Power as it\u2019s known in the west. It found some level of success, but not nearly to the same degree as Sailor Moon. A further attempt was made with yet another Toei Animation property, Ojamajo Doremi, which predictably received a new westernized name: Magical Doremi. It proved even less successful and suffered from consistently low ratings. 4Kids never finished airing the entire series, with the last 25 episodes going straight to the network\u2019s website instead. 4Kids also gained the rights to Futari Wa Pretty Cure, but it never released any episodes before the series was eventually picked up by another distributor.  RELATED: A Decade After Sailor Moon Debuted, Its Director Created a Far Less Popular Sports Anime                 The failure of such anime can be attributed to a number of things -- none of which can be faulted to the shows themselves, but rather, mismanagement on the part of the companies distributing them. Magical Doremi aired at 7:30 am, too early in the morning for most kids to want to tune in on a Saturday. Cardcaptors received heavy backlash from fans of the original source material. When Pioneer gained the rights to distribute the original series on home video -- completely unedited and uncut in the original Japanese dub -- the sub-only DVDs outsold the dub-only DVDs by more than 10,000 units. Likewise, many long-time Pretty Cure fans responded negatively to Hasbro\u2019s decisions to edit and westernize the English dub for Glitter Force -- a practice that in this day and age is no longer considered acceptable. Even the English dubs for the likes of Beyblade keep the original Japanese names and references intact.  It truly is a shame that more companies aren\u2019t willing to put more time and interest in anime aimed at young girls. If they would simply put the same amount of effort into marketing such shows the way they do with Bakugan or Pok\u00e9mon, there\u2019s definite success to be had. There\u2019s a plethora of magical girl and shoujo anime that will never be exported as a result. For now, magical girl aficionados will have to be content with streaming the latest iteration of Pretty Cure subbed.                  What Makes Tokyo Mew Mew So Special?

When Satomi Sone receives her Radiant Red powers, she decides to rob banks to alleviate her financial situation. Emerging hero Radiant Black tries to stop her, but the altercation soon turns deadly. Written by Cherish Chen with artwork from David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto and lettering by Diego Sanches, Radiant Red #2 by Image Comics continues Satomi's story as she reassesses her life choices.  A spinoff of the massively popular Radiant Black series, Radiant Red #2 gets into the thick of the action right from the start. Some unscrupulous yet powerful people want to meet Satomi in an abandoned steel plant. In typical bad guy fashion, Radiant Red walks right into an ambush. She quickly disposes of soon goons, who charge at her as soon as she enters. Suddenly, the creepy man she met at school in the morning appears out of the shadows, patronizingly applauding her on her battle skills. With a blinding flash, he changes into a high-tech suit and asks Satomi to call him Shift. Radiant Red clenches her fists and readily obliges.  RELATED: Image Comics' King Spawn #8 Comic Review                 Satomi has always led an uneventful life, never expecting anyone else, even her family, to exceed the limitations of her middle-class setting. When life finds a way to throw her world into disarray, Satomi goes down a darker path to claw back any semblance of control, inadvertently attracting the attention of the wrong crowd. Radiant Red #2 brings a grounded spin on the superhero genre while introducing a host of new characters that complicate things for the matter-absorbing protagonist. Writer Cherish Chen, who helped creator Kyle Higgins flesh out Satomi's character back in Radiant Black #6, is back at the helm. Between an action-heavy start and a dialogue-heavy end, Chen strikes a fine balance, weaving a narrative laced with action, intrigue, and suspense.  The fan-favorite creative team of artists David Lafuente and Miquel Muerto return to broaden the horizons of the world of Radiant Red. The stylized artwork of the book infuses dynamic energy into the panels as Radiant Red jumps into action, punching villains left, right, and center. From graffiti-laden walls to the dirty, abandoned atmosphere, the anime-esque aesthetic of the character designs works in juxtaposition with its surroundings. Muerto uses a vivid palette of colors that gives off a bright glow throughout the panels, with Radiant Red's crimson radiance overpowering every other shade. The colorful characters in a darker background place focus on the moving elements and add vibrancy to the artwork.  RELATED: Image Comics' Ghost Cage #1 Comic Review                 Despite opening with a flurry of bombastic action, Radiant Red #2 does not contribute much in the way of progression of events as the issue concentrates on building the plot before the final launch. Satomi burrows herself deeper into criminal endeavors, a world she has just scratched the surface of using her Radiant powers but is absolutely out of depth. As the crime boss makes themselves known, they use Satomi's desperation and predicament to their advantage, manipulating Radiant Red into committing one of the greatest heists of all time. Radiant Red #2 ends on a cliffhanger that not only brings new prospects for Satomi but also for the Radiant franchise as a whole.

By Calum Walker Published 11 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Tiger & Bunny 2 introduces a plethora of new heroes -- but one is actually a familiar face. Here's everything to know about Golden Ryan.                  The following article contains spoilers for Tiger & Bunny 2, Episode 3, \"Suspicion Will Raise Bogies,\" now streaming on Netflix.   Tiger & Bunny 2 introduces four new heroes to Stern Bild's First League. Three of these -- Mr. Black, He Is Thomas and Magical Cat -- are brand new to the Tiger & Bunny world and are introduced as such.  This might leave some fans confused regarding the fourth addition, Golden Ryan -- a hero imbued with the power to manipulate gravity. Tiger & Bunny 2 treats Ryan as if he is a character viewers should be familiar with, but many might not be. This is because Golden Ryan -- civilian name Ryan Goldsmith -- actually debuted earlier in the 2014 film Tiger & Bunny: The Rising. RELATED: DBZ Vs. One-Punch Man: ONE Technique Would Allow Goku to DESTROY Saitama                The film follows on from the events of the first season's finale, where Kotetsu and Barnaby were demoted to Stern Bild's Second League. In The Rising, Barnaby is promoted without Kotetsu and given a new partner: Golden Ryan. The film depicts Golden Ryan as a cocky, immature showboat -- one who frustrates both Barnaby and the viewer as a poor replacement for Kotetsu.  Ryan's behavior in the film sets him up as a potential antagonist in league with the film's main villain. However, this turns out to be a red herring -- despite his rudeness, Ryan is revealed to be a genuinely noble hero, who humbly steps aside when he comes to the conclusion that Barnaby would be better off with Kotetsu. The film ends with Ryan leaving Stern Bild for new pastures. However, Ryan returns to the First League in Tiger & Bunny 2, this time paired up with Blue Rose, the veteran ice-themed heroine. As shown in Episode 3, Golden Ryan still struggles with being a team player, arguing that he's being treated as Blue Rose's second banana.  RELATED: Is Avatar: The Last Airbender Technically a Superhero Show?                However, despite his animosity, Ryan is also shown to be genuinely worried when he incorrectly believes Blue Rose is about to replace him as a partner with Kotetsu. He resorts to spying on and illicitly filming them to try to prove to Barnaby that the two are going to team up, which everyone recognizes as mere paranoia on Ryan's part. It's here that Fire Emblem pitches in, explaining why Ryan is the way he is. Prior to coming to Stern Bild, Ryan worked in a city called Oldhabi, where all the heroes worked under one funder. As such, it was a highly competitive environment, with the heroes seeing each other less like comrades and more like rivals.  This toxic environment came to a head when Ryan was possessed by a NEXT villain named Gregory Sunshine, who made Ryan collapse a building on himself. Ryan was left trapped under the debris, but his fellow heroes simply left him, scarring Ryan both physically and emotionally and giving him the distrustful lone wolf personality he has in the present. RELATED: Ayashimon: Ten Pays Homage to a Classic Superhero in the Best Way                Nonetheless, the episode shows that there is genuine hope for Ryan. Part of the reason he returned to Stern Bild in the first place is because he felt that the heroes there weren't backstabbers, demonstrating that he's still capable of trusting others.  At the end of the episode, Blue Rose makes it clear that she has no intention of replacing Ryan as her buddy, and the two reconcile. After starting out in The Rising as a one-dimensional jerk, Golden Ryan has come a long way as a character, and hopefully, Tiger & Bunny 2 will continue to give the golden gravity manipulator more depth in the episodes to come.

A new trailer for the two upcoming Fullmetal Alchemist live-action movies released.  The trailer reintroduces the series' colorful cast of characters, including central protagonists Edward and Alphonse Elric, who will once again be played by Ryosuke Yamada and Atomu Mizuishi, who played the sibling pair in the series' first live-action film. In addition to highlighting returning characters such as Winry, played by Weathering With You's Tsubasa Honda, and Roy Mustang, who will once again be portrayed by actor and musician Dean Fujioka, the trailer also showcases the two sequel films' many new additions to the cast, which includes the character of Olivier Mira Armstrong, who will be portrayed in live-action by Kill Bill's Chiaki Kuriyama.  RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Video Reveals More of the Two New Live-Action Movies    The most heavily promoted of the new additions is the alchemist killer Scar, who will be portrayed in live-action by the Japanese-American actor Mackenyu. Mackenyu, who is the son of legendary martial artist and actor Sonny Chiba, has appeared in multiple live-action anime adaptations before, most notably the Chihayafuru movie trilogy. He is also set to appear in many more in the future, as he is also currently filming Netflix's live-action One Piece series, where he plays the role of the three-sword wielding bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro, and has also been cast as the lead in the upcoming live-action Saint Seiya movie, which is currently in production.  The two new movies, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist: The Vengeance of Scar and Fullmetal Alchemist: The Last Transmutation, serve as direct sequels to the 2017 live-action film and were announced as part of the celebration surrounding the 20th anniversary of the original manga's publication. The two films will be released just a month apart, with the second movie premiering in Japan on May 20 and the trilogy's conclusion releasing on June 24. An international release for both movies has yet to be announced. The first movie in the series was released outside of Japan as a Netflix streaming exclusive.  RELATED: Why Fullmetal Alchemist's Scar Stands No Chance Against His Brotherhood Counterpart Fullmetal Alchemist was created by Hiromi Arakawa in 2001 and was one of the most popular and acclaimed titles of that era. The series tells the story of Ed and Al Elric, two young alchemy prodigies who almost lose everything after they attempt to use their talents to resurrect their dead mother. Now working as alchemists for the state, the two begin their search for the Philosopher's Stone, an artifact that possesses enough power to help them undo their biggest mistake. The series was adapted into an anime twice. Both shows are now streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

A new trailer for the two upcoming Fullmetal Alchemist live-action movies released.  The trailer reintroduces the series' colorful cast of characters, including central protagonists Edward and Alphonse Elric, who will once again be played by Ryosuke Yamada and Atomu Mizuishi, who played the sibling pair in the series' first live-action film. In addition to highlighting returning characters such as Winry, played by Weathering With You's Tsubasa Honda, and Roy Mustang, who will once again be portrayed by actor and musician Dean Fujioka, the trailer also showcases the two sequel films' many new additions to the cast, which includes the character of Olivier Mira Armstrong, who will be portrayed in live-action by Kill Bill's Chiaki Kuriyama.  RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Video Reveals More of the Two New Live-Action Movies    The most heavily promoted of the new additions is the alchemist killer Scar, who will be portrayed in live-action by the Japanese-American actor Mackenyu. Mackenyu, who is the son of legendary martial artist and actor Sonny Chiba, has appeared in multiple live-action anime adaptations before, most notably the Chihayafuru movie trilogy. He is also set to appear in many more in the future, as he is also currently filming Netflix's live-action One Piece series, where he plays the role of the three-sword wielding bounty hunter Roronoa Zoro, and has also been cast as the lead in the upcoming live-action Saint Seiya movie, which is currently in production.  The two new movies, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist: The Vengeance of Scar and Fullmetal Alchemist: The Last Transmutation, serve as direct sequels to the 2017 live-action film and were announced as part of the celebration surrounding the 20th anniversary of the original manga's publication. The two films will be released just a month apart, with the second movie premiering in Japan on May 20 and the trilogy's conclusion releasing on June 24. An international release for both movies has yet to be announced. The first movie in the series was released outside of Japan as a Netflix streaming exclusive.  RELATED: Why Fullmetal Alchemist's Scar Stands No Chance Against His Brotherhood Counterpart Fullmetal Alchemist was created by Hiromi Arakawa in 2001 and was one of the most popular and acclaimed titles of that era. The series tells the story of Ed and Al Elric, two young alchemy prodigies who almost lose everything after they attempt to use their talents to resurrect their dead mother. Now working as alchemists for the state, the two begin their search for the Philosopher's Stone, an artifact that possesses enough power to help them undo their biggest mistake. The series was adapted into an anime twice. Both shows are now streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.
