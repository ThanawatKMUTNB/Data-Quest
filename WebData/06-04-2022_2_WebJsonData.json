By Louis Kemner Published 2 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It Season 2, Episode 1, now streaming on Crunchyroll. Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It is a charming edutainment anime series starring the lovestruck grad students Himuro Ayame and Yukimura Shinya, who are determined to use the power of science to ascertain whether their mutual affection is genuine. Only hard data can prove their love, or so they believed in Season 1. Season 2 has now begun, and the premiere episode calls into question everything Shinya and Ayame hold dear about their relationship and their scientific methods. The new power couple, Fujiwara Suyiu and Chris Florette, recently challenged them to a battle of what true love really is, transforming the series into a true battle shonen title in the process.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts How Science Fell In Love Became A Battle Shonen                  During the events of Season 1, Science Fell in Love was best compared to other \"battle of wits\" romantic series such as Kaguya-sama: Love is War -- which, incidentally, is also returning in the Spring 2022 anime season. Kaguya-Sama and Science Fell in Love both feature intelligent but romantically clueless main lovers who would rather use tricks, traps and exhaustive analysis than tried-and-true romantic gestures, since these characters are too smart (and too proud) for their own good. However, unlike Shinomiya Kaguya and Shirogane Miyuki, Shinya and Ayame aren't trying to force a confession out of the other, although they are willing to question and disprove each other's methods during these experiments. And while the cool-headed kuudere Yukimura Shinya often tries to keep the lovey-dovey Ayame at bay, he certainly loves her back, and she is more her teammate than her rival. So, they need an external foe to face, and Season 2 gives them one -- the Chris-Suiu pair. Shinya and Ayame are no longer merely testing each other's theories or questioning their worthiness in this relationship. They now have a shonen-style rivalry on their hands, complete with Dragon Ball Z-inspired visuals and even a combat system to match. Chris and his playful sadodere girlfriend Suiu are a real power couple who don't feel like they need to prove anything at all, and they have superior oxytocin levels as well. In Season 2's first episode, for example, Shinya and Ayame took on the Chris-Suiu pair in a series of experiments, only to get trounced by the lab results. Their oxytocin levels can't compare to Chris and Suiu's, and Chris even questions the validity of Ayame and Shinya's entire relationship. Now Ayame and Shinya have a rival party to prove themselves to, and as shonen underdogs, they'll have to get resourceful and fight hard against a foe that has all the advantages. This man-vs-man conflict changes the tone of Science Fell in Love, although it's not clear how long that might last. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship The Future Of Science Fell In Love                  So far, it's hard to say whether this new two-vs-two rivalry will define most of Science Fell in Love's second season or if this shonen-style rivalry will only last for one or two episodes before the story moves on to something entirely different. Chris and Suiu might become major players in Season 2 as a well-established couple to challenge the Shinya-Ayame pair, but they might just as easily fade into the background to make room for other new characters to be introduced and interact with the protagonists. Either way, Science Fell in Love has the potential to continue its shonen battle theme, and it's possible that Chris and Suiu are merely the first couple of several to challenge Shinya and Ayame. Season 1 kept itself confined to the main characters, but it's time to expand the scope of the story, and Ayame and Shinya already got a taste of what it's like to compare their budding romance with that of other couples. They were humiliated in the season's first battle, but given how curious and persistent these lab lovebirds are, this challenge will likely motivate them to keep it up and fight more romantic battles in the future until they can score a decisive victory. Science is more than lab coats and beakers -- it's about testing and challenging data, exploring new ideas, comparing things and more. Combined with concrete battle systems such as comparing oxytocin levels, this may allow Science Fell in Love to permanently alter its narrative in Season 2 and leave behind the Kaguya-style antics of Season 1. Now is the time to challenge Ayame and Shinya in new ways, and they appear eager for that challenge. They'll take on all comers to calculate which couple is truly the best.

RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship The Future Of Science Fell In Love                  So far, it's hard to say whether this new two-vs-two rivalry will define most of Science Fell in Love's second season or if this shonen-style rivalry will only last for one or two episodes before the story moves on to something entirely different. Chris and Suiu might become major players in Season 2 as a well-established couple to challenge the Shinya-Ayame pair, but they might just as easily fade into the background to make room for other new characters to be introduced and interact with the protagonists. Either way, Science Fell in Love has the potential to continue its shonen battle theme, and it's possible that Chris and Suiu are merely the first couple of several to challenge Shinya and Ayame. Season 1 kept itself confined to the main characters, but it's time to expand the scope of the story, and Ayame and Shinya already got a taste of what it's like to compare their budding romance with that of other couples. They were humiliated in the season's first battle, but given how curious and persistent these lab lovebirds are, this challenge will likely motivate them to keep it up and fight more romantic battles in the future until they can score a decisive victory. Science is more than lab coats and beakers -- it's about testing and challenging data, exploring new ideas, comparing things and more. Combined with concrete battle systems such as comparing oxytocin levels, this may allow Science Fell in Love to permanently alter its narrative in Season 2 and leave behind the Kaguya-style antics of Season 1. Now is the time to challenge Ayame and Shinya in new ways, and they appear eager for that challenge. They'll take on all comers to calculate which couple is truly the best.

By Louis Kemner Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, \"Isn't This Too Close?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season is here, and it brings a variety of wholesome new and returning anime with it, including Aharen-san is Indecipherable. This brand-new anime is set in a typical high school where the ordinary but kind Raido gets to know his quiet next-door neighbor in class, Aharen Reina. Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable launches a heartwarming relationship between Raido and his tiny classmate, and in the process, Aharen-san viewers should be reminded of similar anime shows such as Komi Can't Communicate, which also streams this season. However, there are a few factors setting these two high school series apart.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                  In Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, the ordinary student Raido glances at the tiny student to his left, the shy kuudere Aharen Reina, who hardly says a word in class, even when the teacher calls on her. Stranger still, when Raido speaks to her, Aharen responds with silent lip movements and little more. Raido can't tell if Aharen is really quiet, or even if she intends to be heard at all. Raido, however, is not the type to just give up on a mystery or leave a lonely person alone, as his actions during Episode 1 prove. Similar to Komi Can't Communicate's protagonist Tadano Hitohto, Raido is a plain guy with a heart of gold, and he sets the story into motion when he resolves to become Aharen's friend and have his first proper conversation with her. He must suspect that Aharen is terribly lonely, and he is proven right later in the episode. Bit by bit, Raido builds a relationship with Aharen and learns the truth: Aharen is a perfectly normal girl who wants to have friends, but she is difficult to hear, and the other girls in her middle school class thought she was weird and pushed her out of their social group. By now, Aharen is a typical anime kuudere; a soft-spoken and unexpressive character who will only express their loving side to the right person and under the right circumstances. Aharen's personality also has elements of the dandere archetype; a meek and shy character who has trouble asserting themselves, much like Komi Shoko herself. Aharen is more of a kuudere than a dandere, but she has enough dandere elements to have overlap with Komi, including having difficulty communicating with others. The series could almost be called Aharen Can't Communicate. RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  The rest of Episode 1 continues to build thematic ties with Komi Can't Communicate, which allows viewers to make some loose predictions about where the story and the character arcs may go from here. Even if Aharen is a bit more assertive and expressive than Komi, she still has a long way to go when it comes to communication, expressing her affection and making friends. The way she is now, Aharen has a tentative friendship with Raido, but the two of them have not yet figured out a pattern for their relationship, and things are in flux between them.

Aharen appears somewhat impressionable in Episode 1, and if Raido isn't careful, he might accidentally encourage Aharen to go way overboard and step into megadere territory. Despite these differences though, Aharen-san is Indecipherable seems likely to follow the same basic story beats as Komi Can't Communicate, including Aharen slowly but surely gaining confidence as she discovers how to make new friends, and her life may become vastly enriched in the process. She will have Raido to thank for all this, and she may express her gratitude through sheer affection and personal loyalty, similar to how Komi eventually developed a crush on her first friend, Tadano. If so, Raido must prepare himself to become Aharen's first friend and her first boyfriend. They should both exercise caution and fully understand their own and each other's emotions before committing to anything big, however, since Aharen is just now coming out of her Komi-style shell, and she has to learn to walk before she can run. That's what Komi did, and it should serve Aharen well too.

By Louis Kemner Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, \"Isn't This Too Close?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season is here, and it brings a variety of wholesome new and returning anime with it, including Aharen-san is Indecipherable. This brand-new anime is set in a typical high school where the ordinary but kind Raido gets to know his quiet next-door neighbor in class, Aharen Reina. Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable launches a heartwarming relationship between Raido and his tiny classmate, and in the process, Aharen-san viewers should be reminded of similar anime shows such as Komi Can't Communicate, which also streams this season. However, there are a few factors setting these two high school series apart.  RELATED: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts                  In Episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, the ordinary student Raido glances at the tiny student to his left, the shy kuudere Aharen Reina, who hardly says a word in class, even when the teacher calls on her. Stranger still, when Raido speaks to her, Aharen responds with silent lip movements and little more. Raido can't tell if Aharen is really quiet, or even if she intends to be heard at all. Raido, however, is not the type to just give up on a mystery or leave a lonely person alone, as his actions during Episode 1 prove. Similar to Komi Can't Communicate's protagonist Tadano Hitohto, Raido is a plain guy with a heart of gold, and he sets the story into motion when he resolves to become Aharen's friend and have his first proper conversation with her. He must suspect that Aharen is terribly lonely, and he is proven right later in the episode. Bit by bit, Raido builds a relationship with Aharen and learns the truth: Aharen is a perfectly normal girl who wants to have friends, but she is difficult to hear, and the other girls in her middle school class thought she was weird and pushed her out of their social group. By now, Aharen is a typical anime kuudere; a soft-spoken and unexpressive character who will only express their loving side to the right person and under the right circumstances. Aharen's personality also has elements of the dandere archetype; a meek and shy character who has trouble asserting themselves, much like Komi Shoko herself. Aharen is more of a kuudere than a dandere, but she has enough dandere elements to have overlap with Komi, including having difficulty communicating with others. The series could almost be called Aharen Can't Communicate. RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  The rest of Episode 1 continues to build thematic ties with Komi Can't Communicate, which allows viewers to make some loose predictions about where the story and the character arcs may go from here. Even if Aharen is a bit more assertive and expressive than Komi, she still has a long way to go when it comes to communication, expressing her affection and making friends. The way she is now, Aharen has a tentative friendship with Raido, but the two of them have not yet figured out a pattern for their relationship, and things are in flux between them. Aharen must figure out how to balance her assertive side vs. her dandere side as a balanced kuudere, and for his part, Raido must find a way to always understand Aharen when she speaks and enable her without making her too reckless. Aharen appears somewhat impressionable in Episode 1, and if Raido isn't careful, he might accidentally encourage Aharen to go way overboard and step into megadere territory. Despite these differences though, Aharen-san is Indecipherable seems likely to follow the same basic story beats as Komi Can't Communicate, including Aharen slowly but surely gaining confidence as she discovers how to make new friends, and her life may become vastly enriched in the process. She will have Raido to thank for all this, and she may express her gratitude through sheer affection and personal loyalty, similar to how Komi eventually developed a crush on her first friend, Tadano. If so, Raido must prepare himself to become Aharen's first friend and her first boyfriend. They should both exercise caution and fully understand their own and each other's emotions before committing to anything big, however, since Aharen is just now coming out of her Komi-style shell, and she has to learn to walk before she can run. That's what Komi did, and it should serve Aharen well too.

What\u2019s the Meaning Behind the Name of This Popular Kyoto Animation Series? Here's a look into the origin and significance of Kyoto Animation's popular mystery anime, Hyouka.      By Ederlyn Peralta Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The popular\u00a0Kyoto Animation series\u00a0Hyouka\u00a0is based on a 2001 Japanese mystery novel of the same name by Honobu Yonezawa. The story centers on Kamiyama High School\u2019s Classic Literature Club, which was on the verge of being abolished until Hotaro Oreki\u2019s older sister requested that\u00a0she join the club. Oreki and the other members of the club -- Eru Chitanda, Satoshi Fukube and Mayaka Ibara -- spend their time solving peculiar mysteries that happen at their school. Hyouka is considered one of the most popular and critically acclaimed anime series produced by Kyoto Animation. Yet, many fans have wondered where the show got its strange name for\u00a0the title. This mystery can be solved by looking into the first major story arc, where\u00a0fans get a detailed explanation\u00a0for\u00a0Hyouka's title.  RELATED: Over a Decade On, Kimi ni Todoke is Still a Masterpiece of the Romance Anime Genre                  In Episode 3, \u201cThe Circumstances of the Classic Lit Club\u2019s Scion,\u201d Chitanda tells Oreki that she joined the Classic Literature Club because of her uncle, Jun Sekitani. She asks Oreki to help her recall a memory of when she talked about the Classic Literature Club with her uncle. This memory is further triggered when she discovers the club\u2019s cultural festival anthology, Hyouka. In the anthology, the opening remarks talk about Sekitani. Soon after, Oreki, Chitanda and the other members hunt for the truth about what happened to\u00a0him as a student at Kamiyama High School -- and the origin of the club\u2019s anthology name, Hyouka. The answers unfold in Episode 5, \u201cThe Truth About the Historic Classic Lit Club.\u201d The group visits the school's librarian, Y\u014dko K\u014driyama, who happened to be the president of the Classic Literature Club when\u00a0Sekitani\u00a0was involved in the school riots.\u00a0It's explained that the riots occurred because the faculty wanted to shorten the cultural festival from five days to two days. The students went on strike against the school, which eventually led to an accidental fire at its combat sports facility. Sekitani was forced to take the blame for the riots while the true mastermind remained in the shadows.\u00a0Chitanda's uncle ends up being expelled from school,\u00a0but his last request was to have the club\u2019s anthology named Hyouka. RELATED: Science Fell in Love: The Best Lessons of the Science Bear, Rikekuma                  Oreki discovers that the title\u00a0Hyouka\u00a0is an oronym: a sequence of words that sound the same as a different sequence in the English language. In Japanese, \"hyouka\" means \"frozen treat,\" while in English the term translates to ice cream -- and the oronym for \u201cice cream\u201d is \u201cI scream.\u201d At first glance the wordplay seems playful, but it\u2019s referencing something more serious. The title represents Sekitani\u2019s silent frustration and agony for being wrongly expelled.\u00a0His intention was to send a message to future club members that\u00a0they should be strong when confronted with the injustices of the world. After discovering the origin of the anthology\u2019s name, \u201chyouka\u201d becomes a lingering nuance throughout the rest of the series. The Classic Literature Club solves more light-hearted mysteries in contrast to the situation involving Sekitani, but the message of being strong remains relevant as the group must overcome challenges they encounter when solving mysteries.

By Michael Lacerna Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Crunchyroll announced today that the\u00a0Funimation YouTube channel will now be known as\u00a0Crunchyroll Dubs. As detailed on the anime streamer's website, the newly renamed Crunchyroll Dubs channel will focus on showcasing dubbed clips, trailers and other content from the company's\u00a0anime library. Japanese language clips will be posted on the company's other YouTube channel, Crunchyroll Collection. In addition to previews of new titles, the Dubs channel will also release full\u00a0episodes of classic shows, beginning with the first English-dubbed episode of the popular isekai anime\u00a0Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World- on April 9. The streaming company says it will add additional free episodes to the Dubs channel on a weekly schedule. The new YouTube releases come a week after Crunchyroll announced that it will\u00a0discontinue free, ad-supported access to new releases on its platform.  RELATED:\u00a0What Funimation's Move to Crunchyroll Means for Anime Fans & the Industry The relaunch of the YouTube channel is the latest step in the merger of the Crunchyroll and Funimation brands. Both companies are now owned by Japanese tech giant Sony, who purchased Funimation in 2017 and then bought up Crunchyroll in 2021. Crunchyroll was previously owned by WarnerMedia and its parent corporation, AT&T. Sony reportedly paid $1.1 billion to acquire the anime streamer. In March,\u00a0Funimation announced that the majority of its streaming library, which includes over 800 anime titles, would now be available on Crunchyroll's service. Funimation also announced that it was winding down operations on its own streaming platform, which was once Crunchyroll's biggest direct competitor. No new shows will are being added to the Funimation service\u00a0following the winter 2022 season. Funimation's home video releases on digital marketplaces and on physical media will now also carry the Crunchyroll branding. RELATED:\u00a0Food Wars, DanMachi, Nozaki-kun and More to be Delisted from Crunchyroll While the newly consolidated Crunchyroll now boasts what it calls the largest library of streaming anime in the world, it's competitors have also stepped up their efforts to command the lucrative anime streaming market: Netflix recently detailed its plans to continue investing in the medium\u00a0after revealing that over half of its global subscribers use the service to watch anime, and Disney+ plans to begin streaming its first exclusive anime series this year, beginning with the upcoming psychological thriller Summer Time Rendering. Crunchyroll, meanwhile, will add three highly anticipated titles to its already substantial library this month, as it prepares to premiere the highly anticipated new seasons of The Rising of the Shield Hero and Kaguya-Sama: Love is War. The platform will also stream the new anime adaptation of Tatsuya Endo's critically acclaimed Spy x Family.

By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Dress-Up Darling was an unexpected smash hit of the Winter 2022 anime season, a shojo-style seinen anime series all about the joy of cosplay and the more wholesome side of otaku culture. It is based on the ongoing manga of the same name,\u00a0so there's no better time for new fans to dive right in and see what the story\u00a0is all about. At first glance, My Dress-Up Darling appears to be yet another slice-of-life anime series set in a typical Japanese high school, but that is only part of the truth. The series also represents what a healthy and meaningful relationship between two very different people should look like, and it can even double as an edutainment anime\u00a0that teaches viewers all about how cosplay and modeling work. It has a lot to give in both anime or manga form.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork The Plot Of My Dress-Up Darling                  My Dress-Up Darling's plot focuses on the two main protagonists, the shy doll-maker Gojo Wakana and the cosplay-loving Kitagawa Marin -- and their budding relationship. They meet early in the story as a classic case of opposites attracting, and most importantly, their respective skills and interests align perfectly. Gojo is a studious and handy boy who has experience making doll clothes, while Marin is confident enough to dress up at cosplay events and even perform amateur modeling for magazines. They soon form an exciting new friendship and cosplay partnership, pooling their talents to create the ultimate cosplay one seam, button and wig at a time. Gojo explores a whole new world as he learns more about cosplay and attends events with his new friend Marin, which helps him break out of his shell without making him too uncomfortable in a new lifestyle. Meanwhile, Marin develops her first crush when Gojo calls her beautiful, like a perfect hina doll, and\u00a0she can't wait to explore the possibility of a true romance with him. She's testing the waters of emotion but isn't yet ready to dive into the world of love until she can master cosplay.\u00a0Symbolic scenes in the anime allude to this, that Marin can't just dive into her amorous feelings without thinking things through first. In the meantime, she has other new friends such as the sisters Shinju and Sajuna to keep her busy. She might even learn from them -- so long as Sajuna doesn't try to steal Gojo away from her. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes Where To Read The My Dress-Up Darling Manga                  The My Dress-Up Darling manga series is ongoing, with nine volumes released in Japan while the Western release is slowly catching up.

Interested fans can find the print volumes of My Dress-Up Darling online from several retailers such as Barnes & Noble,\u00a0the manga/anime online store Right Stuf Anime\u00a0or\u00a0Amazon's books department.

Barnes & Noble offers My Dress-Up Darling with its Nook service,\u00a0while Amazon has a similar offer with its Kindle platform. RELATED: Adachi and Shimamura: How to Get Started With the Popular Yuri Series Where To Watch The My Dress-Up Darling Anime                  The My Dress-Up Darling anime is too new for a Blu-ray/DVD release in the West but is available to watch on a few streaming platforms. It can primarily be found on Crunchyroll\u00a0with all\u00a012 episodes available to stream,\u00a0including the original Japanese dub along with English, Spanish and Portuguese as well. The series is also available in a wide variety of subtitles for different languages. The anime\u00a0also currently streams on Funimation\u00a0but as it's\u00a0merging with Crunchyroll, the latter will become the primary -- possibly only -- streaming option for My Dress-Up Darling in the West.

By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Dress-Up Darling was an unexpected smash hit of the Winter 2022 anime season, a shojo-style seinen anime series all about the joy of cosplay and the more wholesome side of otaku culture. It is based on the ongoing manga of the same name,\u00a0so there's no better time for new fans to dive right in and see what the story\u00a0is all about. At first glance, My Dress-Up Darling appears to be yet another slice-of-life anime series set in a typical Japanese high school, but that is only part of the truth. The series also represents what a healthy and meaningful relationship between two very different people should look like, and it can even double as an edutainment anime\u00a0that teaches viewers all about how cosplay and modeling work. It has a lot to give in both anime or manga form.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork The Plot Of My Dress-Up Darling                  My Dress-Up Darling's plot focuses on the two main protagonists, the shy doll-maker Gojo Wakana and the cosplay-loving Kitagawa Marin -- and their budding relationship. They meet early in the story as a classic case of opposites attracting, and most importantly, their respective skills and interests align perfectly. Gojo is a studious and handy boy who has experience making doll clothes, while Marin is confident enough to dress up at cosplay events and even perform amateur modeling for magazines. They soon form an exciting new friendship and cosplay partnership, pooling their talents to create the ultimate cosplay one seam, button and wig at a time. Gojo explores a whole new world as he learns more about cosplay and attends events with his new friend Marin, which helps him break out of his shell without making him too uncomfortable in a new lifestyle. Meanwhile, Marin develops her first crush when Gojo calls her beautiful, like a perfect hina doll, and\u00a0she can't wait to explore the possibility of a true romance with him. She's testing the waters of emotion but isn't yet ready to dive into the world of love until she can master cosplay.\u00a0Symbolic scenes in the anime allude to this, that Marin can't just dive into her amorous feelings without thinking things through first. In the meantime, she has other new friends such as the sisters Shinju and Sajuna to keep her busy. She might even learn from them -- so long as Sajuna doesn't try to steal Gojo away from her. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes Where To Read The My Dress-Up Darling Manga                  The My Dress-Up Darling manga series is ongoing, with nine volumes released in Japan while the Western release is slowly catching up.

Barnes & Noble offers My Dress-Up Darling with its Nook service,\u00a0while Amazon has a similar offer with its Kindle platform.

It can primarily be found on Crunchyroll\u00a0with all\u00a012 episodes available to stream,\u00a0including the original Japanese dub along with English, Spanish and Portuguese as well. The series is also available in a wide variety of subtitles for different languages. The anime\u00a0also currently streams on Funimation\u00a0but as it's\u00a0merging with Crunchyroll, the latter will become the primary -- possibly only -- streaming option for My Dress-Up Darling in the West.

Actor and singer Rina Ikoma announced that she will play the role of Wistario Afam, the main character of the new\u00a0spinoff story, Urdr Hunt. Ikoma is best known internationally for being a former member of the popular Japanese pop groups AKB48 and Nogizaka46. Ikoma left Nogizaka46 in 2018 to pursue an acting career; while Urdr Hunt will be her first major starring role as a voice actor, she previously starred in the live-action adaptation of Corpse Party in 2015 and appeared in Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation in 2019.

Urdr Hunt's story\u00a0will be distributed\u00a0through the Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans G\u00a0mobile app. While the original IBO anime focused on\u00a0a group of child-soldiers from Mars, the spinoff will tell the story\u00a0of Wistario Afam, an optimistic young boy from Venus, which has been transformed into a massive prison colony. Afam will pilot the ASW-G-35 Gundam Hajiroboshi, a mobile suit that shares many design elements with Mikazuki Augus' Gundam Barbatos from the original series. Urdr Hunt's premiere in Japan will also be accompanied by the broadcast of\u00a0a new \"Special Edition\" of the 2015 anime on Japanese TV. The new version of the show condenses its story from 50 episodes to just nine, but despite the truncated runtime, the show's producers are promising the addition of new \"animation cuts.\" The new release will also feature a new opening sequence and theme song, \"Blaze,\" which is performed by the Japanese rock band Man With a Mission. An international release for the new cut of the series has yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0Watch This Female-Led Mecha Show While You Wait For Gundam: The Witch From Mercury Iron-Blooded Orphans originally premiered in 2015 and is the 14th series in Bandai's long running\u00a0Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. Set in a new continuity, the show tells the tragic story of the a group of child soldiers who rebel against their former masters and establish\u00a0a\u00a0mercenary group\u00a0known as\u00a0Tekkadan. Urdr Hunt is just one of several new Gundam releases planned for 2022: the latest movie in the series, Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island, will be released in Japan on June 3, followed by Gundam: The Witch From Mercury, an all-new anime series, which will premiere next\u00a0fall.

By Michael Lacerna Published 58 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The newest entry in the Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans series has found its lead. Actor and singer Rina Ikoma announced that she will play the role of Wistario Afam, the main character of the new\u00a0spinoff story, Urdr Hunt. Ikoma is best known internationally for being a former member of the popular Japanese pop groups AKB48 and Nogizaka46. Ikoma left Nogizaka46 in 2018 to pursue an acting career; while Urdr Hunt will be her first major starring role as a voice actor, she previously starred in the live-action adaptation of Corpse Party in 2015 and appeared in Kamen Rider Reiwa: The First Generation in 2019.

Urdr Hunt's story\u00a0will be distributed\u00a0through the Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans G\u00a0mobile app. While the original IBO anime focused on\u00a0a group of child-soldiers from Mars, the spinoff will tell the story\u00a0of Wistario Afam, an optimistic young boy from Venus, which has been transformed into a massive prison colony. Afam will pilot the ASW-G-35 Gundam Hajiroboshi, a mobile suit that shares many design elements with Mikazuki Augus' Gundam Barbatos from the original series. Urdr Hunt's premiere in Japan will also be accompanied by the broadcast of\u00a0a new \"Special Edition\" of the 2015 anime on Japanese TV. The new version of the show condenses its story from 50 episodes to just nine, but despite the truncated runtime, the show's producers are promising the addition of new \"animation cuts.\" The new release will also feature a new opening sequence and theme song, \"Blaze,\" which is performed by the Japanese rock band Man With a Mission. An international release for the new cut of the series has yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0Watch This Female-Led Mecha Show While You Wait For Gundam: The Witch From Mercury Iron-Blooded Orphans originally premiered in 2015 and is the 14th series in Bandai's long running\u00a0Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. Set in a new continuity, the show tells the tragic story of the a group of child soldiers who rebel against their former masters and establish\u00a0a\u00a0mercenary group\u00a0known as\u00a0Tekkadan. Urdr Hunt is just one of several new Gundam releases planned for 2022: the latest movie in the series, Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island, will be released in Japan on June 3, followed by Gundam: The Witch From Mercury, an all-new anime series, which will premiere next\u00a0fall.

By Louis Kemner Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a returning rom-com anime\u00a0of the spring 2022 anime season. Its story\u00a0takes place in Saitama University, where a small handful of grad student scientists are determined to use every experiment and formula in the book to determine if they are truly in love. Only the most rigorous testing will reveal the romantic answers in this charming series. It's been a few years since\u00a0Season 1 of Science Fell in Love\u00a0so as the much-anticipated Season 2 begins, new and returning fans alike will want to know the main cast\u00a0and see what makes them tick as both scientists and people. Some of them embody classic anime archetypes and tropes,\u00a0while others are truly one of a kind.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya Yukimura Shinya, The Cool-Headed Love Interest                  Yukimura Shinya is one of the two main lovers in\u00a0Science Fell in Love, though he doesn't always act like the lovestruck young man he is. In fact, Shinya is a recent example of the kuudere character archetype, a confident character who hides their warm, fuzzy emotions behind a cool and aloof exterior. One day, Shinya received an unexpected love confession from his lab partner Himuro Ayame. While he doesn't like to show it,\u00a0he is secretly hoping with all his might that\u00a0their budding romance is genuine -- and will do anything to prove it. Shinya is also the one who, in his boyhood, inspired Ayame to embrace her love of science rather than feel ashamed of it, which may be what drew\u00a0her to him in the first place. Between the two, Shinya is far less likely to make emotional outbursts or act on a whim, but he might secretly admire Ayame for doing so. That's the kuudere way. RELATED: The Best Light Novel Series With Ridiculously Long Titles Himuro Ayame, The Lovestruck Lab Partner                  The lovely Himuro Ayame is Shinya's lab partner and #1 admirer ever since she received kind words of encouragement from him in her girlhood. For years Ayame has loved science and the answers it can provide for life's everyday questions. Now she's ready to use every formula, instrument and experiment she can think of to determine whether her overflowing affection for Shinya is genuine -- or just superficial attraction. Ayame is more of a poetic romantic than Shinya, being a believer in romantic gestures and more likely to listen to her heart, but she also can't forget her duty as a scientist. Ayame is equally likely to consult a data chart or run experiments on her own heart rate as she is to consult a friend about her feelings, making her better balanced but also slightly more vulnerable than Shinya. She is known for having a real temper when she thinks her love is being threatened. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance - But It Isn't Necessary Ibarada Ena Likes To Tease Her Lab Partners                  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have a few friends who tag along for the ride and comment on their endless love experiments, including\u00a0the tiny but surprisingly tough Ibarada Ena, who loves sweet snacks, all kinds of video games and frilly clothes under her white lab coat. So far, it doesn't seem Ena has a crush of her own in Science Fell in Love\u00a0but she does support Shinya and Ayame's budding romance in her own way, sometimes providing input or corrections for Shinya and Ayame's experiments. Ena is also a childhood friend of Inukai Kosuke -- and has him wrapped around her little finger, so to speak. RELATED: The Real-Life Science Behind Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove it Inukai Kosuke Loves 2-D Girls                  Inukai Kosuke is\u00a0Science Fell in Love's comic relief, a somewhat sloppy but well-meaning scientist who is more passionate about dating sim games and waifu pillows than finding work as a scientist after he graduates from Saitama University. He's usually the butt of the jokes, though he is also a trustworthy ally of Shinya's and a good friend to Ena, even if they make fun of him sometimes.\u00a0Kosuke also delivered a quirky but well thought-out presentation on video game theory at a conference in Okinawa late in Season 1. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Kanade Kotonoha Believes In True Love, Too                  One of Ayame's best friends in the lab is the easygoing Kanade Kotonoha, who has been a believer in true love ever since her high school days\u00a0when she nursed a serious crush on a handsome male teacher who helped encourage her curiosity about the world. She plays a minor supporting role in Science Fell in Love as a trustworthy ally to Ayame.

By Louis Kemner Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a returning rom-com anime\u00a0of the spring 2022 anime season. Its story\u00a0takes place in Saitama University, where a small handful of grad student scientists are determined to use every experiment and formula in the book to determine if they are truly in love. Only the most rigorous testing will reveal the romantic answers in this charming series. It's been a few years since\u00a0Season 1 of Science Fell in Love\u00a0so as the much-anticipated Season 2 begins, new and returning fans alike will want to know the main cast\u00a0and see what makes them tick as both scientists and people. Some of them embody classic anime archetypes and tropes,\u00a0while others are truly one of a kind.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya Yukimura Shinya, The Cool-Headed Love Interest                  Yukimura Shinya is one of the two main lovers in\u00a0Science Fell in Love, though he doesn't always act like the lovestruck young man he is. In fact, Shinya is a recent example of the kuudere character archetype, a confident character who hides their warm, fuzzy emotions behind a cool and aloof exterior. One day, Shinya received an unexpected love confession from his lab partner Himuro Ayame. While he doesn't like to show it,\u00a0he is secretly hoping with all his might that\u00a0their budding romance is genuine -- and will do anything to prove it. Shinya is also the one who, in his boyhood, inspired Ayame to embrace her love of science rather than feel ashamed of it, which may be what drew\u00a0her to him in the first place. Between the two, Shinya is far less likely to make emotional outbursts or act on a whim, but he might secretly admire Ayame for doing so. That's the kuudere way. RELATED: The Best Light Novel Series With Ridiculously Long Titles Himuro Ayame, The Lovestruck Lab Partner                  The lovely Himuro Ayame is Shinya's lab partner and #1 admirer ever since she received kind words of encouragement from him in her girlhood. For years Ayame has loved science and the answers it can provide for life's everyday questions. Now she's ready to use every formula, instrument and experiment she can think of to determine whether her overflowing affection for Shinya is genuine -- or just superficial attraction. Ayame is more of a poetic romantic than Shinya, being a believer in romantic gestures and more likely to listen to her heart, but she also can't forget her duty as a scientist. Ayame is equally likely to consult a data chart or run experiments on her own heart rate as she is to consult a friend about her feelings, making her better balanced but also slightly more vulnerable than Shinya. She is known for having a real temper when she thinks her love is being threatened. RELATED: Chihayafuru Has Hinted at Potential Romance - But It Isn't Necessary Ibarada Ena Likes To Tease Her Lab Partners                  Shinya and Ayame aren't alone in that lab at Saitama University. They have a few friends who tag along for the ride and comment on their endless love experiments, including\u00a0the tiny but surprisingly tough Ibarada Ena, who loves sweet snacks, all kinds of video games and frilly clothes under her white lab coat. So far, it doesn't seem Ena has a crush of her own in Science Fell in Love\u00a0but she does support Shinya and Ayame's budding romance in her own way, sometimes providing input or corrections for Shinya and Ayame's experiments. Ena is also a childhood friend of Inukai Kosuke -- and has him wrapped around her little finger, so to speak. RELATED: The Real-Life Science Behind Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove it Inukai Kosuke Loves 2-D Girls                  Inukai Kosuke is\u00a0Science Fell in Love's comic relief, a somewhat sloppy but well-meaning scientist who is more passionate about dating sim games and waifu pillows than finding work as a scientist after he graduates from Saitama University. He's usually the butt of the jokes, though he is also a trustworthy ally of Shinya's and a good friend to Ena, even if they make fun of him sometimes.\u00a0Kosuke also delivered a quirky but well thought-out presentation on video game theory at a conference in Okinawa late in Season 1. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: What Exactly Is Miranjo and King Bosse's Relationship? Kanade Kotonoha Believes In True Love, Too                  One of Ayame's best friends in the lab is the easygoing Kanade Kotonoha, who has been a believer in true love ever since her high school days\u00a0when she nursed a serious crush on a handsome male teacher who helped encourage her curiosity about the world. She plays a minor supporting role in Science Fell in Love as a trustworthy ally to Ayame. While Kanade is easily annoyed or flabbergasted by the romantic love antics around her, she dearly wants her friends to find true happiness and let love blossom between them.

In between scenes, the sharp-tongued Rikekuma will deliver short lectures and expand on the ideas, theories and references mentioned in the episode. No one can scientifically verify how a teddy bear can do all this, but that's just part of the fun. Even Science Fell in Love can bend the truth a little.

By Ryan McCarthy Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. Eren Jaeger has done some pretty terrible things in the Final Season of Attack on Titan and telling his foster sister, Mikasa Ackerman, that he's always hated her is easily the second-worst. The finale of The Final Season: Part Two included a flashback that added another layer of cruelty to Eren's harsh words for\u00a0her by revealing that he was straight-up lying. Armin Arlert was certainly right for leaping across a table to assault Eren for hurting Mikasa, and it turned out he was right again\u00a0in his belief that\u00a0Eren made everything up when he berated them both.  Eren's whole thing in Attack on Titan is freedom -- freedom from Titans and freedom for Eldians. As a result of feeling like he's lived in a cage his whole life, he's developed an intense hatred for anyone who submits to oppression. After Eren padded his villainy stat sheet by slaughtering innocents in Marley and overthrowing Paradis Island's military via assassination and poisoning, he decided to cement his case for biggest jerk in the world by telling Mikasa he's always hated her. Mikasa had spent all her time in the Final Season up to that point defending Eren by saying he must be brainwashed by Zeke and Yelena, and her reward was a slap in the face from the person she loved most. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  A good lie has a bit of truth mixed into it, and Eren used Mikasa's long history of sudden headaches to support his gaslighting. As a descendant of the Ackerman clan -- a group of warriors who protected the king by manifesting the power of Titans in human form -- Mikasa had an awakening of her power when Eren saved her from some crooks when they were kids. While it is true that Mikasa's power awakened in response to Eren's call to action, it was not because she'd mistaken him for her host that she's genetically hardwired to protect. Rather, it was because Eren inspired her and when he gave her his scarf, she devoted herself to him not out of compulsion, but love. During that infamous table scene, Eren told Mikasa that her so-called compulsion to protect him makes her nothing more than a mindless slave with no will of her own. Eren's hatred for slavery is well known, so his alleged reason for hating Mikasa was very convincing, so much so that it brought Mikasa to tears and made the famously pacifistic Armin ready to throw hands. Eren even claimed that his half-brother, Zeke Jaeger, was the one who'd confirmed that Ackermans \"activate\" to defend their host. However, a\u00a0flashback to the actual conversation revealed that Zeke said no such thing. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                  In fact, Zeke said the exact opposite of what Eren claimed he did in a brotherly heart-to-heart that was, tragically, all Zeke had ever wanted with Eren. When Eren voiced his insecurity about why Mikasa is so devoted to him as an Ackerman, Zeke told him that he'd never heard of this \"activation to defend a host\" thing Eren was going on about. What Zeke actually said was that it's more likely that Mikasa just likes Eren so much that she'll tear apart Titans for him. It's still unclear why Eren was out here just inventing mean things to say to people, but what's certain is that he's got a lot of apologies to make once the Rumbling is over -- assuming he or anyone else survives, that is. The picture of why Eren has decided to destroy the entire world beyond Paradis Island is becoming clearer. However, it's not yet clear why telling Mikasa that he's always hated her was a necessary part of his plan. It's obviously not true, given he once tried to fistfight a Titan in his human form to protect her. Eren and Mikasa have always had a complex relationship as\u00a0she played the role of his protector while he didn't\u00a0like feeling inferior to her -- but to say that he's always hated her\u00a0is just bogus. Hopefully, when Attack on Titan's Final Season: Part Three premieres in 2023, an explanation will be given for why Eren lied to Mikasa about having always hated her.

By Louis Kemner Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Dress-Up Darling,\u00a0a popular shojo-style seinen anime series in the Winter 2022 anime season, is the story of an unlikely friendship between the outgoing Kitagawa Marin and the shy Gojo Wakana. They didn't have much in common at first but\u00a0shared\u00a0a passion for cosplay and fabric, and soon became excellent cosplay partners and friends. These two characters play off each other well and enrich one another's daily lives during their adventure to make the best cosplay ever, but notably, Marin hardly\u00a0takes advantage of her strong personality when it\u00a0comes to Gojo. She\u00a0does tease him like a Nagatoro-style sadodere sometimes\u00a0but otherwise respects who and what he is, and that's important.\u00a0Here's how\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling's co-leads\u00a0built a somewhat erotic but fundamentally wholesome friendship together.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork How Marin Respects\u00a0Gojo's Boundaries in My Dress-Up Darling                  At first glance, it seems all Marin ever does is toy with Gojo and annoy him with her flamboyant fan service and\u00a0unpredictable, whimsical behavior. That's true on some level, but Marin proved herself a true friend by respecting him for who he is.\u00a0She knows she can tease Gojo and show him a new world beyond his own while not trying to change his personality or worldview in the process. It's common for stories, anime or otherwise, to portray a quiet introvert like Gojo coming out of their shell and joining the extroverts, but this message\u00a0can do more harm than good in many cases. Introverts don't need extroverts to \"fix\" them. Instead, Marin understands Gojo's shy and hardworking nature and chooses to make the most of it in their partnership without ever calling\u00a0his personality into question. Never once in My Dress-Up Darling does\u00a0she state or even imply that\u00a0he needs to change his ways to suit her, nor does she suggest that\u00a0he's\u00a0inferior to her by being so reserved and timid. Marin clearly prefers more outgoing and lively friends like herself but can also appreciate what Gojo brings to their partnership, cosplay and otherwise. Marin almost sees Gojo's introverted, down-to-earth nature as a novelty to be admired, and would probably feel guilty if she accidentally forced\u00a0him to change his ways to suit her own lifestyle.\u00a0She enjoys sharing her daily life with\u00a0him\u00a0throughout\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling and even teases him, but also maintains the boundary between them. She doesn't want Gojo to become someone he's not, which is an important way to respect who and what he is. Teasing is one thing -- trying to invalidate an introvert's lifestyle is something else entirely. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes How Marin & Gojo Mesh As Contrasting Characters                  Marin\u00a0realized from the very start that she and Gojo are very different people with different self-images, backgrounds and personalities, and she respects\u00a0this in all the ways that count. Being friends with him means finding common ground, and she does just that. In fact,\u00a0the two\u00a0also find ways to make up for each other's weaknesses, which means that having two Marin-type personalities in this relationship would have held the partnership back. Marin needs what only Gojo, as he is, can provide. Otherwise, she would have sought help from one of her gal-pals instead. She\u00a0respects Gojo not just as a friend but also as a skilled partner who can do things she can't, and vice versa. Due to being a hardworking, humble introvert, Gojo is ideal for work-intensive tasks that call for diligence rather than charisma and social skills, and sure enough,\u00a0he quietly toils away all night to finish a costume for Marin in record time. He also channels My Hero Academia's Midoriya Izuku and patiently studies other people's techniques, taking meaningful notes while being humble enough to learn anything he must about cosplay. This is exactly the partner Marin needed, and\u00a0as she respects and admires Gojo's nature, she has the patience to stand back and let\u00a0him do his thing. Throughout My Dress-Up Darling, she treats him carefully so he can focus on his work and enjoy it. Marin may tease Gojo but she never questions his methods or personality. She knows how to keep her business partner happy and let him find validation in this work his own way -- and the results speak for themselves.

By Louis Kemner Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Dress-Up Darling,\u00a0a popular shojo-style seinen anime series in the Winter 2022 anime season, is the story of an unlikely friendship between the outgoing Kitagawa Marin and the shy Gojo Wakana. They didn't have much in common at first but\u00a0shared\u00a0a passion for cosplay and fabric, and soon became excellent cosplay partners and friends. These two characters play off each other well and enrich one another's daily lives during their adventure to make the best cosplay ever, but notably, Marin hardly\u00a0takes advantage of her strong personality when it\u00a0comes to Gojo. She\u00a0does tease him like a Nagatoro-style sadodere sometimes\u00a0but otherwise respects who and what he is, and that's important.\u00a0Here's how\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling's co-leads\u00a0built a somewhat erotic but fundamentally wholesome friendship together.  RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Celebrates Season Finale With New Artwork How Marin Respects\u00a0Gojo's Boundaries in My Dress-Up Darling                  At first glance, it seems all Marin ever does is toy with Gojo and annoy him with her flamboyant fan service and\u00a0unpredictable, whimsical behavior. That's true on some level, but Marin proved herself a true friend by respecting him for who he is.\u00a0She knows she can tease Gojo and show him a new world beyond his own while not trying to change his personality or worldview in the process. It's common for stories, anime or otherwise, to portray a quiet introvert like Gojo coming out of their shell and joining the extroverts, but this message\u00a0can do more harm than good in many cases. Introverts don't need extroverts to \"fix\" them. Instead, Marin understands Gojo's shy and hardworking nature and chooses to make the most of it in their partnership without ever calling\u00a0his personality into question. Never once in My Dress-Up Darling does\u00a0she state or even imply that\u00a0he needs to change his ways to suit her, nor does she suggest that\u00a0he's\u00a0inferior to her by being so reserved and timid. Marin clearly prefers more outgoing and lively friends like herself but can also appreciate what Gojo brings to their partnership, cosplay and otherwise. Marin almost sees Gojo's introverted, down-to-earth nature as a novelty to be admired, and would probably feel guilty if she accidentally forced\u00a0him to change his ways to suit her own lifestyle.\u00a0She enjoys sharing her daily life with\u00a0him\u00a0throughout\u00a0My Dress-Up Darling and even teases him, but also maintains the boundary between them. She doesn't want Gojo to become someone he's not, which is an important way to respect who and what he is. Teasing is one thing -- trying to invalidate an introvert's lifestyle is something else entirely. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling Embodies Horimiya's Best Storytelling Themes How Marin & Gojo Mesh As Contrasting Characters                  Marin\u00a0realized from the very start that she and Gojo are very different people with different self-images, backgrounds and personalities, and she respects\u00a0this in all the ways that count. Being friends with him means finding common ground, and she does just that. In fact,\u00a0the two\u00a0also find ways to make up for each other's weaknesses, which means that having two Marin-type personalities in this relationship would have held the partnership back. Marin needs what only Gojo, as he is, can provide. Otherwise, she would have sought help from one of her gal-pals instead. She\u00a0respects Gojo not just as a friend but also as a skilled partner who can do things she can't, and vice versa. Due to being a hardworking, humble introvert, Gojo is ideal for work-intensive tasks that call for diligence rather than charisma and social skills, and sure enough,\u00a0he quietly toils away all night to finish a costume for Marin in record time. He also channels My Hero Academia's Midoriya Izuku and patiently studies other people's techniques, taking meaningful notes while being humble enough to learn anything he must about cosplay. This is exactly the partner Marin needed, and\u00a0as she respects and admires Gojo's nature, she has the patience to stand back and let\u00a0him do his thing. Throughout My Dress-Up Darling, she treats him carefully so he can focus on his work and enjoy it. Marin may tease Gojo but she never questions his methods or personality. She knows how to keep her business partner happy and let him find validation in this work his own way -- and the results speak for themselves.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 7 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Neon Genesis Evangelion was a landmark series for both the mecha anime genre as well as anime in general. A dark and psychological deconstruction of the genre, the show completely upended everything about mecha shows while dripping with subtext. Of course, this success saw many imitators try to emulate the formula, although one of these supposed copies get an unfair reputation because of it. RahXephon is seen by many as merely an\u00a0Evangelion wannabe, but the series is so much more. Although the two certainly share some similar themes and concepts, they handle them in vastly different ways, all while being far different from each other than many realize. There are even elements that\u00a0RahXephon does better than its supposed \"inspiration,\" making its criticisms more than premature.  RELATED:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai What Is RahXephon?                  RahXephon is set in a world where Japan has been ravaged by interdimensional invaders known as Mulians, or Mu. These creatures, almost indistinguishable from humans beyond their blue blood, pilot powerful clay \"Dolems\" in order to take over and encapsulate Tokyo. Encasing it in a ring barrier, the Mu are warred against by humanity, namely the defense research agency TERRA. The protagonist is Ayato Kamina, a seemingly normal young man who becomes entangled with TERRA and comes to pilot the mysterious \"RahXephon\" weapon against the Dolems. While it's considered a mecha or robot, it, like the Dolems themselves, is made out of clay. In the ensuing battles against the invaders, Kamina learns more about himself as well as his old friend Haruka, whose history together Kamina had come to forget. The result is as much of a love story as it is a mecha series, although there are definitely intentional influences from old-school Super Robot anime of the 1970s. However, a much more contemporary fellow mecha is what many assume was the real inspiration. Why RahXephon Isn't Just an Evangelion Ripoff                  Many critics of\u00a0RahXephon have noted the similarities between it and\u00a0Evangelion, and these comparisons are not unfounded. Both have a young man being forced to pilot a robot that may or may not represent his mother\u00a0at the behest of a secret organization, all while he has strange sexual tension with another mother figure. That's not to mention the swathes of subtext, symbolism and similarly unorthodox designs of the Dolems and the Angels in\u00a0Evangelion. While this is all fair, it's what\u00a0RahXephon does with these themes that helps differentiate it from the real\u00a0Evangelion ripoffs. RELATED:\u00a0Gundam\u2019s Iron-Blooded Orphans Spinoff Trailer Introduces a Slew of New Characters and Mecha Whereas\u00a0Evangelion tends to have tons of arguably irrelevant religious iconography,\u00a0RahXephon's symbolism feels much more natural and organic to its themes. Said themes typically involve music, arguably making it closer to fellow mecha show\u00a0Eureka Seven. Ironically, despite all the religious symbolism in\u00a0Evangelion, it's\u00a0RahXephon that actually directly addresses anything religious. For instance, one episode takes place during Christmas, and the non-Christian TERRA crew discuss what such a holiday means to them. While it could be argued by some that the show is \"dumber\" for talking about these concepts, it helps to make all of its symbolism much more than just cool Easter Eggs. Likewise, the use of topics such as ancient civilizations feels like a fittingly intentional throwback to classic shows such as\u00a0Godmars. Another element that\u00a0RahXephon does better than\u00a0Evangelion is its protagonist. While he has his groan-worthy moments, Kamina is much more proactive and less whiny than Shinji Ikari, which also helps to make the plot move along better. Although some of the side characters\u00a0in RahXephon\u00a0aren't quite as strong as Asuka or Rei, the main character, and arguably the Misato stand-in as well, are much more enjoyable characters. This all comes together to make a show that's sadly too covered in by the shadow of\u00a0Evangelion, when in reality, it's more of a celebration of the mecha genre than the former ever was.

Student Council shenanigans are imminent as President Shirogane and Vice President Shinomiya will continue trying to get the other to confess their love.

The scoreboard of Kaguya-sama\u00a0can be tricky to keep track of considering Shirogane and Shinomiya sometimes\u00a0both\u00a0win or lose. Going strictly by what the series' narrator says, there appears to be a difference between an actual tie and an instance in which Shirogane and Shinomiya both won or lost, so the scoreboard reflects that distinction. And although the love war is solely being fought between the two co-leads, the supporting cast occasionally find themselves as the winner or loser of any given bout.

Shirogane, on the other hand, holds a losing record of 15 wins and 24 losses. If Shinomiya and Shirogane are the only competitors, shouldn't their records be inverses of one another? Ordinarily yes, but the narrator has declared them co-winners and co-losers on several occasions, which has skewed their final tallies away from a traditional score. There have only been two instances in which the narrator declared an official tie, giving Shinomiya a commanding lead of 23-16-2 over Shirogane's 15-24-2. Not only is Shinomiya currently in the lead, but she's held it for nearly the entire series to this point.\u00a0She emerged victorious from Season 1 by picking up 12 wins to Shirogane's nine. Season 2 of Kaguya-sama saw Shinomiya defend her title, winning 11 matches while Shirogane escaped with a mere six wins. It's a good thing\u00a0they don\u2019t seem to be keeping track of the score themselves -- Shirogane would\u00a0give up all hope knowing how badly he's losing while Shinomiya's overconfidence from her winning record would\u00a0likely lead to her own downfall.

Although it's rare, supporting characters like Fujiwara Chika and Ishigami Yu -- and even minor\u00a0ones like Shirogane Kei and Kashiwagi Nagisa -- have found themselves on Kaguya-sama's scoreboard. Considering none of the supporting cast is actually a part of the battle between Shinomiya and Shirogane, they only get a win or a loss if they've had a good or bad experience in a segment that's not focused on the titular war of love.

Dragon Ball Super: Why Was Majin Buu Dropped From the Tournament of Power? Majin Buu has a ton of power underneath his comical girth, but he sadly didn't get to show it off during Dragon Ball Super's Tournament of Power.     By Timothy Donohoo Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Dragon Ball Super has added several new layers to the famous franchise, all the while bringing back elements and characters\u00a0that had\u00a0been somewhat looked over or hadn't been prominent in a while. One of these is Majin Buu. Though he was the final villain in\u00a0Dragon Ball Z, he wasn't featured very prominently in the now non-canon\u00a0Dragon Ball GT, making it somewhat easier to forget him. Sadly,\u00a0Super\u00a0has knocked him backward as much as it's pushed him forward. Though\u00a0Dragon Ball Super brought Buu back into the limelight in a more overtly heroic fashion, it failed to feature him in one of its biggest arcs. Buu's absence during the Tournament of Power was explained in-universe, but it still feels awfully hackneyed. Here's a look at the most likely true reasons for Buu not showing his\u00a0stuff at the Tournament of Power.  RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Super Artist Draws New Super Hero Characters in Classic Style Buu\u00a0Failed the Written Test\u00a0to Enter the Tournament of Power                  The Tournament of Power in\u00a0Dragon Ball Super is as grandiose as it sounds and quite deadly in nature. Held between the various universes within the multiverse, the fighters representing each\u00a0one battle for much more than mere titles. Any team\u00a0that loses will have their universe destroyed, as the idea behind the tournament is that the Grand Zeno believes there are far too many universes in existence. Majin Buu was initially part of Universe 7's team, which represents the\u00a0primary realm of\u00a0Dragon Ball Super. The arrogant Saiyan prince Vegeta actually questioned this, as Buu was known to be weaker after splitting from his evil incarnation. Goku, however, noted how much incredible power Buu still had, and that he'd be a vital asset to their team. Unfortunately, through failing the written test to enter the tournament as well as falling asleep before a fight, Buu was unable to help protect Universe 7. This forced Goku to recruit Frieza in order to have enough team members. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Super: How Mai Became a Child Again & How Old She Really Is Why Did Toriyama Drop Buu From the Tournament of Power?                  Though the narrative reasons for Buu being absent during the Tournament of Power are plain as day, it still doesn't explain why\u00a0he was left\u00a0out after Goku even explained how useful he'd be.

Majin Buu has a ton of power underneath his comical girth, but he sadly didn't get to show it off during Dragon Ball Super's Tournament of Power.     By Timothy Donohoo Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Dragon Ball Super has added several new layers to the famous franchise, all the while bringing back elements and characters\u00a0that had\u00a0been somewhat looked over or hadn't been prominent in a while. One of these is Majin Buu. Though he was the final villain in\u00a0Dragon Ball Z, he wasn't featured very prominently in the now non-canon\u00a0Dragon Ball GT, making it somewhat easier to forget him. Sadly,\u00a0Super\u00a0has knocked him backward as much as it's pushed him forward. Though\u00a0Dragon Ball Super brought Buu back into the limelight in a more overtly heroic fashion, it failed to feature him in one of its biggest arcs. Buu's absence during the Tournament of Power was explained in-universe, but it still feels awfully hackneyed. Here's a look at the most likely true reasons for Buu not showing his\u00a0stuff at the Tournament of Power.  RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Super Artist Draws New Super Hero Characters in Classic Style Buu\u00a0Failed the Written Test\u00a0to Enter the Tournament of Power                  The Tournament of Power in\u00a0Dragon Ball Super is as grandiose as it sounds and quite deadly in nature. Held between the various universes within the multiverse, the fighters representing each\u00a0one battle for much more than mere titles. Any team\u00a0that loses will have their universe destroyed, as the idea behind the tournament is that the Grand Zeno believes there are far too many universes in existence. Majin Buu was initially part of Universe 7's team, which represents the\u00a0primary realm of\u00a0Dragon Ball Super. The arrogant Saiyan prince Vegeta actually questioned this, as Buu was known to be weaker after splitting from his evil incarnation. Goku, however, noted how much incredible power Buu still had, and that he'd be a vital asset to their team. Unfortunately, through failing the written test to enter the tournament as well as falling asleep before a fight, Buu was unable to help protect Universe 7. This forced Goku to recruit Frieza in order to have enough team members. RELATED:\u00a0Dragon Ball Super: How Mai Became a Child Again & How Old She Really Is Why Did Toriyama Drop Buu From the Tournament of Power?                  Though the narrative reasons for Buu being absent during the Tournament of Power are plain as day, it still doesn't explain why\u00a0he was left\u00a0out after Goku even explained how useful he'd be. Part of it was likely the potential of Goku having to fight on the same team as Frieza -- the slave broker of his species -- in order to protect their universe. This not only provides for some gravitas, but it also helps that Frieza is a much more popular villain than Buu. It could be argued that Buu was too silly of a character to be able to compete in the serious nature of the Tournament of Power. This is backed up by his falling into a lazy stupor, as well as\u00a0his not being smart enough to even pass the written part of the entrance. Despite these setbacks, he, as Goku pointed out, was still an incredibly powerful fighter. In fact, the real reason for Buu's being written out of the Tournament of Power\u00a0is likely that he was\u00a0too powerful. The tail end of\u00a0Dragon Ball Z\u00a0saw Buu put quite\u00a0a hurtin' on the powerful Vegeta, and more recently in Super he had trained to gain a more svelte, robust form.\u00a0Buu also had incredible abilities such as immense stamina, healing other fighters and the power to turn opponents into candy. This logically could have made him too tough for\u00a0anyone the Tournament of Power would have thrown at him. After all, even Buu would've gotten serious if innocent\u00a0people\u00a0like Hercule were threatened, and he was no slouch when it came to using his powers at opportune times. Sadly he was unable to show off his true potential in helping determine the fate of his universe, with Super rendering him a slovenly goofball -- at least for now.

By Michael Lacerna Published 21 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Rising of the Shield Hero's long-awaited second season will premiere on\u00a0Crunchyroll at exactly 6:00 A.M. PST on April 6. The simulcast of the series was previously confirmed for April 6, the same day that the show will be broadcast in Japan, but in a testament to just how anticipated\u00a0the isekai series' new continuation is, Crunchyroll announced the specific time that the show will be available for streaming on its platform. The show will be available in the following territories:\u00a0North America, Central America, South America, Europe, Africa, Oceania, the Middle East, and CIS. RELATED:\u00a0The Best Anime to Watch After The Rising of the Shield Hero  The show will return\u00a0roughly two years after the completion of the show's first, 25-episode long season. Upon its premiere in\u00a02019, the series received some criticism for\u00a0its use of a false sexual assault allegation as a plot point, but the show has since become a hit with both fans and many critics alike, with praise being directed towards its\u00a0memorable cast of characters and its willingness to shake up well-worn isekai genre tropes. The first season was such a hit that the show's producers immediately announced that the series was\u00a0being renewed for a second and third season, which is a rarity amongst anime productions. The second season was originally scheduled to premiere in the fall of 2021, but was delayed to its current release date. The second season will see some notable changes to the series' crew: while the first season was helmed by director\u00a0Takao Abo, who previously worked on the mecha anime\u00a0Macross Frontier\u00a0and Eureka Seven,\u00a0the second season will instead be directed by\u00a0Masato Jinbo, who directed both seasons of Restaurant to Another World. Production on the\u00a0second season will be split between Kinema Citrus, which produced the anime's\u00a0first season, and South Korean animation studio DR Movie.\u00a0The voice cast from the original season will return to reprise their roles for Season 2, where they will be joined by\u00a0Kana Hanazawa, who previously starred in Durarara!! and Cells at Work.\u00a0Hanazawa will voice the mysterious Ost Horai, the latest addition to Naofumi's adventuring party. RELATED:\u00a0Rising of the Shield Hero and Bofuri Collide in Isekai Crossover Promotion The new season of the show sees Naofumi, the eponymous Shield Hero, and his two most trusted traveling companions, Raphtalia and Filo, setting out on a journey to stop the rampage of a massive legendary beast, the Spirit Tortoise. The Shield Hero franchise originally began in 2012 as a web novel series by author Aneko Yusagi. Yusagi's original work has since been adapted into a manga and a light novel series, which\u00a0are now available in English from One Peace Press.

Another character is helping her friends from the distance in the latest Attack on Titan episode.     By Christian Markle Published Mar 27, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 27, \"Retrospective,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The death of Sasha Braus hurt not only the fans but also her regiment, since she is one of the best snipers of the Survey Corps and\u00a0Attack on Titan\u00a0in general. The latest episode of the anime unveiled the Survey Corps' new ally to be as efficient as the late potato lover when it comes to sharpshooting. While she may not replace the group's beloved friends, her skills prove to be a great asset for the success of Hange's small resistance group. Sasha proved her superior aiming skills multiple times. The most noteworthy of which was when she covered for the Survey Corps members during their raid on Liberio. Perhaps the biggest mistake she committed back then was not eliminating the young Gabi, who ended up being her murderer. Now, Gabi\u00a0is taking on Sasha's role.  RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan Marks the Return of the Anime's Earliest Antagonist                   \u00a0 Even though Gabi was initially a loyal Marleyan supremacist, she turned over a new leaf after learning the truth about Paradis Island from Sasha's very own family. Eren's\u00a0sinister\u00a0plan solidified her resolve to fight and save her hometown. She owned up her mistakes and begged the furious Jean for his help to stop Eren. During Armin and Connie's attempt to trick Floch and the Jaegerists into peacefully giving them Azumiboto's flying boat, Floch took notice of their plan and declared them as traitors. Floch ordered the destruction of the boat, which resulted in a bloodbath. After Connie murdered Daz and Samuel and no other Jaegerist could blow the ship, Floch took the matter to his own hand. However, Gabi was able to shoot him down, resulting in Floch's thunder spear barely missing the ship. While this impressive feat greatly helped the resistance, it wasn't just a lucky shot. Even before the Survey Corps attacked Liberio, Gabi was already shown as a dependable warrior. In fact, she was able to singlehandedly take out an armored train during her debut. Floch was also not the first victim of Gabi's sharpshooting. As most fans know and hate, Gabi took Sasha's life with a single shot. She was also able to snipe Eren, resulting in the latter's beheading, as they attempt to prevent the brothers from making contact. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Falco Debuts the New Jaw Titan - and It's a Game-Changer                  Gabi taking up Sasha's role is also not an unprecedented event. Sasha's most epic moment\u00a0was when she saved the young Kaya from a Titan with only a wooden bow and arrows. She bravely jumped into the Titan's head and sunk an arrow into its eye, giving them a window to escape. During Zeke's mass Titanification, Kaya found herself in a similar situation. That time, however, it wasn't her big sister Sasha who saved her. It was Gabi, who she briefly saw as Sasha. That brief moment of resemblance may have been\u00a0a foreshadowing of the young girl\u00a0assuming her victim's role. Gabi may have been -- and probably still is -- one of the most hated characters in\u00a0Attack on Titan, but\u00a0she has been redeeming herself bit by bit in the latest episodes of the anime. With her covering the members of the resistance from a good distance,\u00a0the Eren-killing group may be able to move more freely, albeit only slightly.

During Armin and Connie's attempt to trick Floch and the Jaegerists into peacefully giving them Azumiboto's flying boat, Floch took notice of their plan and declared them as traitors. Floch ordered the destruction of the boat, which resulted in a bloodbath. After Connie murdered Daz and Samuel and no other Jaegerist could blow the ship, Floch took the matter to his own hand. However, Gabi was able to shoot him down, resulting in Floch's thunder spear barely missing the ship. While this impressive feat greatly helped the resistance, it wasn't just a lucky shot. Even before the Survey Corps attacked Liberio, Gabi was already shown as a dependable warrior. In fact, she was able to singlehandedly take out an armored train during her debut. Floch was also not the first victim of Gabi's sharpshooting. As most fans know and hate, Gabi took Sasha's life with a single shot. She was also able to snipe Eren, resulting in the latter's beheading, as they attempt to prevent the brothers from making contact. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Falco Debuts the New Jaw Titan - and It's a Game-Changer                  Gabi taking up Sasha's role is also not an unprecedented event. Sasha's most epic moment\u00a0was when she saved the young Kaya from a Titan with only a wooden bow and arrows. She bravely jumped into the Titan's head and sunk an arrow into its eye, giving them a window to escape. During Zeke's mass Titanification, Kaya found herself in a similar situation. That time, however, it wasn't her big sister Sasha who saved her. It was Gabi, who she briefly saw as Sasha. That brief moment of resemblance may have been\u00a0a foreshadowing of the young girl\u00a0assuming her victim's role. Gabi may have been -- and probably still is -- one of the most hated characters in\u00a0Attack on Titan, but\u00a0she has been redeeming herself bit by bit in the latest episodes of the anime. With her covering the members of the resistance from a good distance,\u00a0the Eren-killing group may be able to move more freely, albeit only slightly.

By Ryan McCarthy Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The finale of Attack on Titan, The Final Season: Part Two harkened back to the series' beginning in the darkest of ways. When a young Bertholdt Hoover used his Colossal Titan to destroy the gate of Shiganshina so that Titans could get in, Eren Jaeger's mother was eaten right in front of him. After evacuating, a tearful and rage-filled Eren declared he was going to kill every single Titan in the world. Fast forward to Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity\" and Eren is still saying \"kill them all\" -- but now he's saying it while using Titans to wipe out humanity.  When a young Eren Jaeger declared he would rid the world of Titans himself, it appeared to be little more than wishful thinking. At the time, even Mindless Titans were unstoppable as humanity within the Walls knew next to nothing about their greatest enemy and didn't even know about the existence of their actual\u00a0enemy. At the start of Attack on Titan, there was nothing Eren hated more than Titans, and who could've guessed that becoming one himself would still be considered \"simpler times\" in retrospect. As things spun out of control on Paradis Island with the reveal of several spies from beyond the Walls who could become Titans, even Eren couldn't keep track of who his enemy was anymore. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  After the defeat of Zeke Jaeger, Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover in Shiganshina when humanity within the Walls reclaimed their lost territory, Eren finally accessed his father's basement and learned the truth of the world. The nation of Marley became Eren's new enemy when he learned that they'd been the ones turning people into Titans and sending them to Paradis Island to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting population. The revelation that humanity was not only thriving beyond the Walls but also trying to kill them, was a lot for Eren to take in all at once and understandably warped\u00a0his identity on a fundamental level. Eren's heart was broken when the citizens of Paradis Island finally defeated Titans and reclaimed their territory, only to learn that even more enemies awaited them across the very sea that Eren and Armin had longed to visit. Eren had always felt like he was trapped in a cage while growing up inside the Walls, with the threat of a Titan invasion looming over every moment. The fact that the outside world he'd grown up wanting to visit\u00a0was just another cage surrounded by enemies officially shifted\u00a0his pathological hatred from Titans to everyone outside the Walls. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                  The war between Marley and Paradis Island is long and complicated, but Marleyans aren't the only people who despise Eldians. Just about the only thing that the entire outside world of Attack on Titan agrees on is that Eldians are Island Devils who should be eliminated. Now that Eren has obtained the Founding Titan, he has chosen to save Paradis Island by destroying every inch of the world beyond its shores. \"The Dawn of Humanity\" saw Eren become the very thing that drove him to this point in the first place as his Founding Titan descended upon a helpless city, slaughtering countless innocent civilians who don't even understand what's happening or why. Eren's original \"kill them all\" was a reasonable emotion to feel toward the clear-cut enemy of the series, Titans. Now the world of Attack on Titan has become infinitely more complex and Eren's latest \"kill them all,\" is understandable, but not sympathetic.\u00a0His journey from protagonist to antagonist has been a poignant, emotional character evolution of an angry boy growing into a vengeful man. Things are looking pretty grim -- and are likely to get even worse -- once Attack on Titan's Final Season returns for Part Three in 2023 as Eren Jaeger's war against the world comes to a head.

By Ryan McCarthy Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity,\" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The finale of Attack on Titan, The Final Season: Part Two harkened back to the series' beginning in the darkest of ways. When a young Bertholdt Hoover used his Colossal Titan to destroy the gate of Shiganshina so that Titans could get in, Eren Jaeger's mother was eaten right in front of him. After evacuating, a tearful and rage-filled Eren declared he was going to kill every single Titan in the world. Fast forward to Season 4, Episode 28, \"The Dawn of Humanity\" and Eren is still saying \"kill them all\" -- but now he's saying it while using Titans to wipe out humanity.  When a young Eren Jaeger declared he would rid the world of Titans himself, it appeared to be little more than wishful thinking. At the time, even Mindless Titans were unstoppable as humanity within the Walls knew next to nothing about their greatest enemy and didn't even know about the existence of their actual\u00a0enemy. At the start of Attack on Titan, there was nothing Eren hated more than Titans, and who could've guessed that becoming one himself would still be considered \"simpler times\" in retrospect. As things spun out of control on Paradis Island with the reveal of several spies from beyond the Walls who could become Titans, even Eren couldn't keep track of who his enemy was anymore. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Rumbling Really Is Unstoppable                  After the defeat of Zeke Jaeger, Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover in Shiganshina when humanity within the Walls reclaimed their lost territory, Eren finally accessed his father's basement and learned the truth of the world. The nation of Marley became Eren's new enemy when he learned that they'd been the ones turning people into Titans and sending them to Paradis Island to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting population. The revelation that humanity was not only thriving beyond the Walls but also trying to kill them, was a lot for Eren to take in all at once and understandably warped\u00a0his identity on a fundamental level. Eren's heart was broken when the citizens of Paradis Island finally defeated Titans and reclaimed their territory, only to learn that even more enemies awaited them across the very sea that Eren and Armin had longed to visit. Eren had always felt like he was trapped in a cage while growing up inside the Walls, with the threat of a Titan invasion looming over every moment. The fact that the outside world he'd grown up wanting to visit\u00a0was just another cage surrounded by enemies officially shifted\u00a0his pathological hatred from Titans to everyone outside the Walls. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: Floch Wasn't the Only One Eren Told About His Plan                  The war between Marley and Paradis Island is long and complicated, but Marleyans aren't the only people who despise Eldians. Just about the only thing that the entire outside world of Attack on Titan agrees on is that Eldians are Island Devils who should be eliminated. Now that Eren has obtained the Founding Titan, he has chosen to save Paradis Island by destroying every inch of the world beyond its shores. \"The Dawn of Humanity\" saw Eren become the very thing that drove him to this point in the first place as his Founding Titan descended upon a helpless city, slaughtering countless innocent civilians who don't even understand what's happening or why. Eren's original \"kill them all\" was a reasonable emotion to feel toward the clear-cut enemy of the series, Titans. Now the world of Attack on Titan has become infinitely more complex and Eren's latest \"kill them all,\" is understandable, but not sympathetic.\u00a0His journey from protagonist to antagonist has been a poignant, emotional character evolution of an angry boy growing into a vengeful man. Things are looking pretty grim -- and are likely to get even worse -- once Attack on Titan's Final Season returns for Part Three in 2023 as Eren Jaeger's war against the world comes to a head.

Yashahime finally completes its greatest arc yet after the conclusion of Sessh\u014dmaru and Kirinmaru's long-standing rivalry as the Great Beast Kings of the East and West. When\u00a0the two fight in front of Rin, the series' biggest antagonist suddenly has a change of heart that will redirect the plot and change everyone's future. While fans rejoice as peace is restored and the entire cast of both\u00a0Inuyasha and Yashahime are reunited for the first time, several major characters die before the next chapter of the sequel series begins.  RELATED: Should Moroha Have Been Yashahime's Main Character?                  In Episode 47 of Yashahime, Rion remains in control of the Grim Butterfly as Moroha and Setsuna work to cut her threads of fate that reveal her undying love for her father Kirinmaru. However, Towa remains locked in her solo fight against Mr. Kirin when Riku comes to her rescue. While they manage to take down Mr. Kirin, Riku is fatally wounded and dies in the process. When he dies in Towa's arms,\u00a0Riku finally\u00a0admits how much he loves her and wants her to live for his sake. While the rest of the cast\u00a0encircles\u00a0the Grim Butterfly to contain it,\u00a0the final showdown between the two most powerful demons in\u00a0Yashahime's world is taking place at the Tree of Ages where Sessh\u014dmaru and Kirinmaru go head-to-head. When Jaken advises Rin to\u00a0flee the battlefield to safety, Sessh\u014dmaru shockingly instructs his wife to stay and watch his fight with Kirinmaru instead. During their action-packed clash, Kirinmaru can't help but imagine the face of his helpless daughter Rion whenever he looks at Rin. As a human,\u00a0her presence reminds\u00a0him of his humanity and love for his daughter who was killed in front of him. Kirinmaru\u00a0gets distracted and is ultimately defeated by\u00a0Sessh\u014dmaru before asking the Great Dog Demon to kill him. However, Rion can sense that her father fell in battle and uses the red threads of fate to bring him to her in the Grim Butterfly as Sessh\u014dmaru, Rin and Jaken follow them. After successfully freeing Rion, the loving parents meet up with their twin daughters and niece. Towa allows Rion to use her body momentarily to live long enough to reconnect with Kirinmaru as he arrives.\u00a0The two finally tell each other how they feel before agreeing to leave this world together to reunite with Zero in the afterlife. When Rion's spirit departs for the final time, Towa's consciousness is restored as the Bakuseiken and Zanseiken merge together to form the legendary sword known as the Sword of Amatsumikaboshi. RELATED: Yashahime: How Inuyasha Completed His Powerful Transition to Fatherhood                  After\u00a0father and daughter depart for the afterlife and the Grim Butterfly disappears,\u00a0everyone's\u00a0favorite characters and their families gather around the Tree of Ages to celebrate. Rin finally fulfills her promise and hugs both Towa and Setsuna now that they're safe from their enemies.\u00a0Sessh\u014dmaru watches them while admitting to Jaken that he showed mercy on Kirinmaru and Rion\u00a0because he knew that's what his daughters wanted. Jaken notes how happy\u00a0Sessh\u014dmaru looks when he's watching his wife and daughters hug, exposing the immense character\u00a0development\u00a0the powerful demon had undergone. Moroha happily stands beside her parents Inuyasha and Kagome, the three of them smiling at each other with pure joy at being together as a family after\u00a014 difficult years apart. Behind them, Sango and Miroku stand beside their three children and Kohaku. Other notable attendees of the reunion include Shippo, Takechiyo, Hachi and Kirara, who are expected to become more consistent supporting characters throughout the rest of Yashahime. While fans rejoice at the epic reunion they waited two seasons for, they must also come to terms with the deaths of the characters they've grown to love. Riku's sudden death\u00a0was a shock, but there\u00a0is still hope he'll live on after many viewers noticed a horn-shaped object inside Towa's body when it was restored. With Rion and Kirinmaru now out of the picture, the series must create a new overarching antagonist and conflict to drive the plot forward. Previews of Episode 48 allude to a brand new chapter starting in Yashahime and with the entire cast finally reunited, fans can expect original Inuyasha characters to play a much bigger role in the future.

By Louis Kemner Published 32 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, \"Isn't This Too Close?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season has arrived, and it features more than a few wholesome anime series, including the brand-new Aharen-san is Indecipherable, which feels like a sister to the ongoing series Komi Can't Communicate. Both anime shows feature a heroine who has trouble speaking to others, but even so, Aharen and Komi have their differences. These slice-of-life heroines are both shy girls who can't easily form friendships or romances with the people around them, but their personalities differ on a fundamental level, which helps set Aharen-san apart. While Komi Shoko is a traditional dandere anime character, Aharen Reina is a twist on the kuudere archetype, and that makes her more compelling than ever.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  In the course of just one episode, Aharen-san is Indecipherable establishes its namesake heroine as not just a kuudere anime character like Nifuji Hirotaka or Sohma Yuki, but one who is made more complex with elements from other -dere types, too. In anime, the -dere archetypes usually describe how a character expresses their affection, with hot-headed tsunderes being prickly and defensive before opening up, kuuderes being aloof and cool-headed before opening up to their chosen love interest and so on. A kuudere in particular simply chooses to not get too involved with the people around them; they are quiet and unexpressive as a matter of preference. This sets them apart from dandere characters like Shoko, who are shy and unassertive to the point of putting themselves down out of excessive modesty or insecurity. It could be said that danderes are less in control of their behavior than kuuderes are, but Aharen Reina blurs the line between these archetypes plus adds a little more. In the series premiere, Aharen is compelling not just because of her cuteness or the humor of her silent mouth movements, but because she has the assertive nature of a kuudere combined with the insecurities of a dandere, making her something entirely new in modern anime. She is quiet and aloof by choice, as a true kuudere, and she is self-assured when she expresses affection for her new friend, her high school classmate Raido. At the same time, Aharen is insecure about her difficulty speaking to others and being heard, and she has unpleasant memories of her female classmates rejecting her offers of friendship in middle school. Aharen is \"once bitten, twice shy,\" but she is only insecure about her ability to express herself, not her worthiness as a friend. Self-doubt and self-depreciation are major symptoms of being a dandere, but Aharen lacks those. She knows she can be a good friend to someone, but the barrier of silence stands in her way. For a time, she had chosen to give up trying to overcome that obstacle, but now she's fighting to be heard, and Raido wants to listen. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                  Aharen's unusual combination of kuudere and dandere not only sets her apart in the story of Aharen-san is Indecipherable but also allows fans to make general predictions about the future of her character arc, her relationship with Raido and the story's overall tone. Fans can compare her hybrid -dere antics to similar characters such as Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi and certainly Komi Shoko from Komi Can't Communicate, to make some guesses about what she might say or do next. In Episode 1, for example, Aharen chooses to only stay in Raido's company and direct all her affection toward him, kuudere-style, which suggests that she may act jealously in future episodes if anyone else tries to be Raido's friend. Aharen isn't necessarily a petty or selfish person, but it's clear that this new friendship is an important and symbolic step for her, and she might overreact and shoo away anyone else who wants her to share Raido with them. If so, this will likely happen in a humorous rather than dramatic way, given the series' rom-com tone. It's also possible that Aharen and Raido's relationship will become romantic sooner than expected, especially given Aharen's slight megadere streak, and she might get in over her head. In that case, her dandere side may take over, and she could get flustered and retreat back into her shell, which may take Raido by surprise. Aharen isn't afraid to assertively express her affection to Raido, but once a certain point is reached, she may lose her nerve and rethink her relationship with him. She will have to determine if she has the courage to get serious with Raido and let her kuudere nature triumph over her dandere insecurities.

By Louis Kemner Published 32 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for episode 1 of Aharen-san is Indecipherable, \"Isn't This Too Close?\", now streaming on Crunchyroll. The Spring 2022 anime season has arrived, and it features more than a few wholesome anime series, including the brand-new Aharen-san is Indecipherable, which feels like a sister to the ongoing series Komi Can't Communicate. Both anime shows feature a heroine who has trouble speaking to others, but even so, Aharen and Komi have their differences. These slice-of-life heroines are both shy girls who can't easily form friendships or romances with the people around them, but their personalities differ on a fundamental level, which helps set Aharen-san apart. While Komi Shoko is a traditional dandere anime character, Aharen Reina is a twist on the kuudere archetype, and that makes her more compelling than ever.  RELATED: Science Fell in Love's Season Premiere Continues Anime's New Sadodere Trend                  In the course of just one episode, Aharen-san is Indecipherable establishes its namesake heroine as not just a kuudere anime character like Nifuji Hirotaka or Sohma Yuki, but one who is made more complex with elements from other -dere types, too. In anime, the -dere archetypes usually describe how a character expresses their affection, with hot-headed tsunderes being prickly and defensive before opening up, kuuderes being aloof and cool-headed before opening up to their chosen love interest and so on. A kuudere in particular simply chooses to not get too involved with the people around them; they are quiet and unexpressive as a matter of preference. This sets them apart from dandere characters like Shoko, who are shy and unassertive to the point of putting themselves down out of excessive modesty or insecurity. It could be said that danderes are less in control of their behavior than kuuderes are, but Aharen Reina blurs the line between these archetypes plus adds a little more. In the series premiere, Aharen is compelling not just because of her cuteness or the humor of her silent mouth movements, but because she has the assertive nature of a kuudere combined with the insecurities of a dandere, making her something entirely new in modern anime. She is quiet and aloof by choice, as a true kuudere, and she is self-assured when she expresses affection for her new friend, her high school classmate Raido. At the same time, Aharen is insecure about her difficulty speaking to others and being heard, and she has unpleasant memories of her female classmates rejecting her offers of friendship in middle school. Aharen is \"once bitten, twice shy,\" but she is only insecure about her ability to express herself, not her worthiness as a friend. Self-doubt and self-depreciation are major symptoms of being a dandere, but Aharen lacks those. She knows she can be a good friend to someone, but the barrier of silence stands in her way. For a time, she had chosen to give up trying to overcome that obstacle, but now she's fighting to be heard, and Raido wants to listen. RELATED: How My Dress-Up Darling's Marin and Gojo Built Anime's Healthiest Friendship                  Aharen's unusual combination of kuudere and dandere not only sets her apart in the story of Aharen-san is Indecipherable but also allows fans to make general predictions about the future of her character arc, her relationship with Raido and the story's overall tone. Fans can compare her hybrid -dere antics to similar characters such as Nifuji Hirotaka from Wotakoi and certainly Komi Shoko from Komi Can't Communicate, to make some guesses about what she might say or do next. In Episode 1, for example, Aharen chooses to only stay in Raido's company and direct all her affection toward him, kuudere-style, which suggests that she may act jealously in future episodes if anyone else tries to be Raido's friend. Aharen isn't necessarily a petty or selfish person, but it's clear that this new friendship is an important and symbolic step for her, and she might overreact and shoo away anyone else who wants her to share Raido with them. If so, this will likely happen in a humorous rather than dramatic way, given the series' rom-com tone. It's also possible that Aharen and Raido's relationship will become romantic sooner than expected, especially given Aharen's slight megadere streak, and she might get in over her head. In that case, her dandere side may take over, and she could get flustered and retreat back into her shell, which may take Raido by surprise. Aharen isn't afraid to assertively express her affection to Raido, but once a certain point is reached, she may lose her nerve and rethink her relationship with him. She will have to determine if she has the courage to get serious with Raido and let her kuudere nature triumph over her dandere insecurities.

By Jonathon Greenall Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Some anime and manga creators are well known worldwide. For instance, mention Hideaki Anno to an anime fan and\u00a0many will instantly realize\u00a0who you're talking about. However,\u00a0others remain largely unknown despite creating -- or\u00a0having a significant\u00a0role\u00a0in -- legendary shows. Nowhere is this better displayed than with Kunihiko Ikuhara, as despite being a massive part of anime history, the famously eccentric Penguindrum creator isn't as well known as his contemporaries. Ikuhara recently made headlines when he announced he would be changing his name to Bonsoir Ikuhara, a move that turned out to be a creative promotion for\u00a0his new musical project called Teiko BonBon. However, this isn't the only time the famous creator has bucked the trend and followed his own path.  Related:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary                  Kunihiko Ikuhara joined Toei Animation in 1986, with his earliest role coming as assistant director on several Toei shows, including Maple Town Monogatari, Akuma-kun\u00a0and M\u014dretsu Atar\u014d. However, most American anime fans' first exposure to him\u00a0will have been his work on Sailor Moon. Ikuhara directed several episodes of the legendary magical girl show, starting with Episode 6, \"Protect the Melody of Love: Usagi Plays Cupid.\" During the second season, Sailor Moon R,\u00a0Ikuhara would become the series' director, taking over from Junichi Sato.\u00a0He\u00a0also directed\u00a0Sailor Moon R: The Movie, cementing him as a visionary director with an eye for impressive and memorable visuals. However, Ikuhara got annoyed with the lack of creative control Toei offered him and eventually left the company. After this, he would join up with several other creatives to form the art collective Be-Papas. RELATED: Tower of God's Cat and Dog Mini-Arc Is a Shakespearean Tragedy Be-Papas consisted of Ikuhara, shojo artist Chiho Saito, Neon Genesis Evangelion animation supervisor Shinya Hasegawa, former Sailor Moon writer Y\u014dji Enokido and producer Yuuichirou Okuro. The name, according to Okuro, was a reference to the group growing up by stepping out on their own. Be-Papas would work on the legendary manga and anime Revolutionary Girl Utena. The manga came out in 1996 with the anime soon following in 1997, and both quickly cemented themselves as cult classics. Ikuhara took the director role for the anime, leading to the show's unique visual style. He would also reprise this role for the feature film, Adolescence of Utena in 1999, which presented a different take on the themes and story of Utena and showed Ikuhara's ability to create moving and symbolic sequences. After the Adolescence of Utena's release, Be-Papas disbanded -- but this was far from the end for Ikuhara. In 2001\u00a0he would team up with Seinosuke Ito and Chiho Saito to release the manga The World Exists for Me. He would also write the serialized novel Nokemono to Hanayome\u00a0which ran between 2006-2017, and worked on several other projects covering everything from manga to music. Related:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai                  In 2011, Ikuhara returned to the director's chair to direct the supernatural mystery series Penguindrum, which\u00a0he created and also co-wrote with Takayo Ikami. The series will be re-released later this year in the form of a remastered, updated and re-edited film titled Re:cycle of Penguindrum. Aside from that, he has directed and worked on several anime shows in the interim. In 2015 he directed\u00a0Yurikuma Arashi, a series based on a manga he wrote. Then in 2019, Ikuhara created and co-directed\u00a0Sarazanmai, an anime about students who turn into kappas. However, Ikuhara isn't just known for his creative work. He is famous for being extremely open in interviews, often giving clever, funny or surreal answers to questions. He's also known for his eccentric fashion choices; an image of him and Nagano Mamoru cosplaying as Sailor Venus and Mars is frequently reposted by fans. This is on top of his habit of changing his pseudonym depending on his current project, making Bonsoir Ikuhara just one in a long line of name changes. Kunihiko Ikuhara is a legendary anime creator who has rightfully earned a legion of dedicated fans. From his early work to the crowning achievement that was Revolutionary Girl Utena, Ikuhara has shown how versatile anime is as a storytelling and artistic medium. Hopefully, Re:cycle of Penguindrum and his upcoming projects get Ikuhara even more attention from fans in North America and across the world.

By Jonathon Greenall Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Some anime and manga creators are well known worldwide. For instance, mention Hideaki Anno to an anime fan and\u00a0many will instantly realize\u00a0who you're talking about. However,\u00a0others remain largely unknown despite creating -- or\u00a0having a significant\u00a0role\u00a0in -- legendary shows. Nowhere is this better displayed than with Kunihiko Ikuhara, as despite being a massive part of anime history, the famously eccentric Penguindrum creator isn't as well known as his contemporaries. Ikuhara recently made headlines when he announced he would be changing his name to Bonsoir Ikuhara, a move that turned out to be a creative promotion for\u00a0his new musical project called Teiko BonBon. However, this isn't the only time the famous creator has bucked the trend and followed his own path.  Related:\u00a0Spy X Family Creator Shares Adorable New Art for Series\u2019 Anniversary                  Kunihiko Ikuhara joined Toei Animation in 1986, with his earliest role coming as assistant director on several Toei shows, including Maple Town Monogatari, Akuma-kun\u00a0and M\u014dretsu Atar\u014d. However, most American anime fans' first exposure to him\u00a0will have been his work on Sailor Moon. Ikuhara directed several episodes of the legendary magical girl show, starting with Episode 6, \"Protect the Melody of Love: Usagi Plays Cupid.\" During the second season, Sailor Moon R,\u00a0Ikuhara would become the series' director, taking over from Junichi Sato.\u00a0He\u00a0also directed\u00a0Sailor Moon R: The Movie, cementing him as a visionary director with an eye for impressive and memorable visuals. However, Ikuhara got annoyed with the lack of creative control Toei offered him and eventually left the company. After this, he would join up with several other creatives to form the art collective Be-Papas. RELATED: Tower of God's Cat and Dog Mini-Arc Is a Shakespearean Tragedy Be-Papas consisted of Ikuhara, shojo artist Chiho Saito, Neon Genesis Evangelion animation supervisor Shinya Hasegawa, former Sailor Moon writer Y\u014dji Enokido and producer Yuuichirou Okuro. The name, according to Okuro, was a reference to the group growing up by stepping out on their own. Be-Papas would work on the legendary manga and anime Revolutionary Girl Utena. The manga came out in 1996 with the anime soon following in 1997, and both quickly cemented themselves as cult classics. Ikuhara took the director role for the anime, leading to the show's unique visual style. He would also reprise this role for the feature film, Adolescence of Utena in 1999, which presented a different take on the themes and story of Utena and showed Ikuhara's ability to create moving and symbolic sequences. After the Adolescence of Utena's release, Be-Papas disbanded -- but this was far from the end for Ikuhara. In 2001\u00a0he would team up with Seinosuke Ito and Chiho Saito to release the manga The World Exists for Me. He would also write the serialized novel Nokemono to Hanayome\u00a0which ran between 2006-2017, and worked on several other projects covering everything from manga to music. Related:\u00a0How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's \"Aura Battler Dunbine\" Influenced Isekai                  In 2011, Ikuhara returned to the director's chair to direct the supernatural mystery series Penguindrum, which\u00a0he created and also co-wrote with Takayo Ikami. The series will be re-released later this year in the form of a remastered, updated and re-edited film titled Re:cycle of Penguindrum. Aside from that, he has directed and worked on several anime shows in the interim. In 2015 he directed\u00a0Yurikuma Arashi, a series based on a manga he wrote. Then in 2019, Ikuhara created and co-directed\u00a0Sarazanmai, an anime about students who turn into kappas. However, Ikuhara isn't just known for his creative work. He is famous for being extremely open in interviews, often giving clever, funny or surreal answers to questions. He's also known for his eccentric fashion choices; an image of him and Nagano Mamoru cosplaying as Sailor Venus and Mars is frequently reposted by fans. This is on top of his habit of changing his pseudonym depending on his current project, making Bonsoir Ikuhara just one in a long line of name changes. Kunihiko Ikuhara is a legendary anime creator who has rightfully earned a legion of dedicated fans. From his early work to the crowning achievement that was Revolutionary Girl Utena, Ikuhara has shown how versatile anime is as a storytelling and artistic medium. Hopefully, Re:cycle of Penguindrum and his upcoming projects get Ikuhara even more attention from fans in North America and across the world.

By Michael Lacerna Published 5 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A massive new Fullmetal Alchemist statue has been unveiled, but it might be one of the costliest exchanges in the series' history. Good Smile Company is now taking preorders on its new Edward and Alphonse Elric statue. The massive statue is 16 inches tall and 17 inches wide, and depicts the brothers in\u00a0battle as Ed transmutes his automail arm\u00a0into a dagger and Al transforms the ground to give his older sibling a boost. True to\u00a0the series' law of equivalent exchange, the highly detailed and sizable figure comes with an equally hefty\u00a0price tag: $2,199.99 USD. The preorder window for the statue will close on May 11, though hardcore fans will want to scrounge together the funds quickly, however, as Good Smile warns only a limited number of the statues will be produced and the preorder window may close early if orders meet\u00a0the production limit.

Fullmetal Alchemist was created by celebrated manga author and artist Hiromu Arakawa in 2001. The series was one of the most popular manga series of the early '00s, achieving a global circulation of over 80 million copies. The series tells the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use their natural talent in alchemy -- the ability to transform one object into another -- to try to resurrect their beloved mother after she suddenly passes away. The attempt goes horribly awry and costs Ed an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body and is only able to survive by having his soul anchored to an old suit of armor. Devastated by their losses, the two brothers join their country's military force, where they work as State Alchemists as they try to find a legendary artifact that will let them undo their biggest mistake.

A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, premiered in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of Arakawa's original work and is now generally regarded as the superior adaptation. The series has also been adapted into a series of live-action movies, the first of which was released in 2017. The second and third entries in the trilogy are scheduled to be released in Japan later this year. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

By Marc York Published 3 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 has officially wrapped, and on a chilling note. Eren Yeager, in his enormous Founding Titan form, has finally made landfall with his legion of Wall Titans. Even the combined military might of the entire world is powerless to stop the coming onslaught. Meanwhile, Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, although they obviously won't make it before a sizeable chunk of the human population beyond Paradis Island is trampled. However, this is all supposed to end, it certainly won't be pretty. What's really bothering fans, though, is that they won't be able to see the stunning conclusion until 2023.  With another year to go before Attack on Titan finally truly concludes, anime-only viewers are left to wonder about a lot of things. One would think that all of the major questions of AOT would have been answered by now. Anything along the lines of \"Eren starts the Rumbling\" sounds like it would be the ultimate spoiler for the series. Despite that, however, there are still things left unanswered that people want to know about. Before Attack on Titan can conclude for real (i.e., no more \"Parts\"), it will have to at least give fans the answers they've been craving. RELATED:\u00a0Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important What is the mysterious, spine-like creature?                  Attack on Titan Episode 80, \"From You, 2,000 Years Ago,\" finally introduced the source of Titans in the world. Thousands of years ago, a young Ymir stumbled into a pool of water beneath a tree and almost drowns, However, she is intercepted by a creature swimming in the water and transformed into what is now known as the Founding Titan. In the present day, Eren, the false\u00a0inheritor of the Founding Titan, has his head shot off and almost dies. However, the same creature that saved Ymir all those millennia ago emerges from Eren's body and attaches itself to his head, thus transforming him into the new Founding Titan. Nobody is quite sure what to make of this thing. Many have likened it to the hallucigenia, a real-life organism that lived in the Cambrian Period. What it really is and where it came from baffles even some manga readers. RELATED:\u00a0How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? How can the Rumbling be stopped?                  Nobody seems certain about what to do to stop the Rumbling. The united armies of the world tried firing at the Wall Titans, but there are far too many of them. Not even the united armies of the world could gather the firepower to stop millions upon millions of colossi. Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, but there's no telling how they'll do it. Armin wants to believe that they'll be able to talk some sense into Eren to get him to stop. The others are more convinced that they'll be forced to kill him. Even if Eren's friends decide to stop him with force, there's no telling how Eren himself will respond. With the powers of the Founding Titan, he doesn't even have to fight them directly; he could just brainwash them into not fighting him. Why he hasn't simply done this already remains a mystery. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll Where are Eren and Zeke?                  Eren's current whereabouts are unknown. That is to say, the location of his real body is unknown. Obviously, it has to be somewhere along the skeleton so massive that not even the word \"colossal\" can't describe it, but that's part of the problem. For one thing, much of the Founding Titan is a giant skeleton, including the nape of the neck where the Titan Shifters would normally reside. That means Eren has to be somewhere else along this massive body; for all anyone knows, he could have transformed completely into the Titan itself. Zeke's whereabouts are similarly unknown. The last anyone saw of him was in Episode 80; as Eren was turning into the Founding Titan, Zeke was apparently overtaken by the hallucigenia. That implies that, like Eren, he's located somewhere along the Founding Titan's body. It's even possible that he's become one with the Founding Titan along with Eren. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper Who will survive?                  This is the question everyone must ask even if they don't like the answer. For all of the beloved characters who have died in AOT already, there are still so many fan-favorites for whom audiences will have to wave a tearful goodbye. It hurts, but it's going to happen. It's just a question of who will, in fact, kick the bucket. Obviously, the Titan Shifters are fated to die within the next 13 years, but that doesn't mean some of them won't die in this final battle. Reiner, in particular, seems to be looking for just the right place to die. Besides the Titan Shifters, there are plenty of beloved characters with targets on their heads. Neither Jean nor Connie nor anyone else going up against Eren and his titans is safe, not even Levi. If main characters are meant to die, there's no better place than the series finale. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan's Latest Joke Has a Tragic Connection In what format will the anime conclude?                  This doesn't necessarily pertain to the narrative, but it's something a lot of people have been wondering about. Even manga readers have no idea how the anime staff is planning on handling the grand finale of AOT. Apparently, the \"Final Season\" is being divided into an additional third part. Fans have a couple of ideas for how the last chapters of AOT will be adapted. The simple answer would be to adapt the remaining chapters into more episodes. However, many fans say that the grand finale will be a feature-length film; these are only rumors, but it remains entirely plausible. It's important to remember that there are only nine chapters of AOT left to adapt. This seems like too few chapters to make the ideal 12-episode cour, but it might be just right for a film. In any case, everyone's desperate to know how everything will end for the anime.

By Marc York Published 3 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains major spoilers for Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. Attack on Titan: The Final Season Part 2 has officially wrapped, and on a chilling note. Eren Yeager, in his enormous Founding Titan form, has finally made landfall with his legion of Wall Titans. Even the combined military might of the entire world is powerless to stop the coming onslaught. Meanwhile, Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, although they obviously won't make it before a sizeable chunk of the human population beyond Paradis Island is trampled. However, this is all supposed to end, it certainly won't be pretty. What's really bothering fans, though, is that they won't be able to see the stunning conclusion until 2023.  With another year to go before Attack on Titan finally truly concludes, anime-only viewers are left to wonder about a lot of things. One would think that all of the major questions of AOT would have been answered by now. Anything along the lines of \"Eren starts the Rumbling\" sounds like it would be the ultimate spoiler for the series. Despite that, however, there are still things left unanswered that people want to know about. Before Attack on Titan can conclude for real (i.e., no more \"Parts\"), it will have to at least give fans the answers they've been craving. RELATED:\u00a0Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important What is the mysterious, spine-like creature?                  Attack on Titan Episode 80, \"From You, 2,000 Years Ago,\" finally introduced the source of Titans in the world. Thousands of years ago, a young Ymir stumbled into a pool of water beneath a tree and almost drowns, However, she is intercepted by a creature swimming in the water and transformed into what is now known as the Founding Titan. In the present day, Eren, the false\u00a0inheritor of the Founding Titan, has his head shot off and almost dies. However, the same creature that saved Ymir all those millennia ago emerges from Eren's body and attaches itself to his head, thus transforming him into the new Founding Titan. Nobody is quite sure what to make of this thing. Many have likened it to the hallucigenia, a real-life organism that lived in the Cambrian Period. What it really is and where it came from baffles even some manga readers. RELATED:\u00a0How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? How can the Rumbling be stopped?                  Nobody seems certain about what to do to stop the Rumbling. The united armies of the world tried firing at the Wall Titans, but there are far too many of them. Not even the united armies of the world could gather the firepower to stop millions upon millions of colossi. Eren's friends are on their way to stop him, but there's no telling how they'll do it. Armin wants to believe that they'll be able to talk some sense into Eren to get him to stop. The others are more convinced that they'll be forced to kill him. Even if Eren's friends decide to stop him with force, there's no telling how Eren himself will respond. With the powers of the Founding Titan, he doesn't even have to fight them directly; he could just brainwash them into not fighting him. Why he hasn't simply done this already remains a mystery. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan's New Antagonist May Have Topped Shiganshina's Death Toll Where are Eren and Zeke?                  Eren's current whereabouts are unknown. That is to say, the location of his real body is unknown. Obviously, it has to be somewhere along the skeleton so massive that not even the word \"colossal\" can't describe it, but that's part of the problem. For one thing, much of the Founding Titan is a giant skeleton, including the nape of the neck where the Titan Shifters would normally reside. That means Eren has to be somewhere else along this massive body; for all anyone knows, he could have transformed completely into the Titan itself. Zeke's whereabouts are similarly unknown. The last anyone saw of him was in Episode 80; as Eren was turning into the Founding Titan, Zeke was apparently overtaken by the hallucigenia. That implies that, like Eren, he's located somewhere along the Founding Titan's body. It's even possible that he's become one with the Founding Titan along with Eren. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper Who will survive?                  This is the question everyone must ask even if they don't like the answer. For all of the beloved characters who have died in AOT already, there are still so many fan-favorites for whom audiences will have to wave a tearful goodbye. It hurts, but it's going to happen. It's just a question of who will, in fact, kick the bucket. Obviously, the Titan Shifters are fated to die within the next 13 years, but that doesn't mean some of them won't die in this final battle. Reiner, in particular, seems to be looking for just the right place to die. Besides the Titan Shifters, there are plenty of beloved characters with targets on their heads. Neither Jean nor Connie nor anyone else going up against Eren and his titans is safe, not even Levi. If main characters are meant to die, there's no better place than the series finale. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan's Latest Joke Has a Tragic Connection In what format will the anime conclude?                  This doesn't necessarily pertain to the narrative, but it's something a lot of people have been wondering about. Even manga readers have no idea how the anime staff is planning on handling the grand finale of AOT. Apparently, the \"Final Season\" is being divided into an additional third part. Fans have a couple of ideas for how the last chapters of AOT will be adapted. The simple answer would be to adapt the remaining chapters into more episodes. However, many fans say that the grand finale will be a feature-length film; these are only rumors, but it remains entirely plausible. It's important to remember that there are only nine chapters of AOT left to adapt. This seems like too few chapters to make the ideal 12-episode cour, but it might be just right for a film. In any case, everyone's desperate to know how everything will end for the anime.

The film was originally scheduled to be released on April 22 in Japan, with a North American premiere to follow sometime this summer. Goku and friends' latest theatrical outing was indefinitely delayed following the incident, and a new release date for the highly anticipated movie has yet to be announced. Production on Toei Animation's other big anime movie, One Piece Film: Red, appears to be going smoothly, as the studio has been releasing a steady stream of new information and art from the film in recent weeks. Most recently, the studio revealed full-color art for\u00a0Luffy, Nami and Zoro's new costumes. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island for a music festival for a new adventure that will focus on Red-Haired Shanks, the pirate captain who inspired Luffy to follow in his footsteps, and a new, as-yet unnamed female character, who appears to be a singer of some kind. The movie will be released in Japan on Aug. 6. Details about the film's international release have yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0One Piece: The True Nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, Explained Toei Animation was originally founded in 1948 and is one of Japan's oldest and most well-known\u00a0animation companies. The studio has worked on some of the most iconic anime series of all time, including Mazinger Z, Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon and Yu-Gi-Oh. Despite working on some of the biggest anime series in history, the studio has had a strained relationship with fans in recent years, and has been criticized for its heavy-handed approach to protecting its copyrights online. In 2021, the company\u00a0kicked off a\u00a0controversy about fair use policies when it used copyright strikes to remove hundreds of reviews of its shows off of YouTube. The incident caused YouTube to implement new policies to protect reviewers.

The film was originally scheduled to be released on April 22 in Japan, with a North American premiere to follow sometime this summer. Goku and friends' latest theatrical outing was indefinitely delayed following the incident, and a new release date for the highly anticipated movie has yet to be announced. Production on Toei Animation's other big anime movie, One Piece Film: Red, appears to be going smoothly, as the studio has been releasing a steady stream of new information and art from the film in recent weeks. Most recently, the studio revealed full-color art for\u00a0Luffy, Nami and Zoro's new costumes. The movie sees the Straw Hat Pirates traveling to a new island for a music festival for a new adventure that will focus on Red-Haired Shanks, the pirate captain who inspired Luffy to follow in his footsteps, and a new, as-yet unnamed female character, who appears to be a singer of some kind. The movie will be released in Japan on Aug. 6. Details about the film's international release have yet to be announced. RELATED:\u00a0One Piece: The True Nature of Luffy's Devil Fruit, Explained Toei Animation was originally founded in 1948 and is one of Japan's oldest and most well-known\u00a0animation companies. The studio has worked on some of the most iconic anime series of all time, including Mazinger Z, Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon and Yu-Gi-Oh. Despite working on some of the biggest anime series in history, the studio has had a strained relationship with fans in recent years, and has been criticized for its heavy-handed approach to protecting its copyrights online. In 2021, the company\u00a0kicked off a\u00a0controversy about fair use policies when it used copyright strikes to remove hundreds of reviews of its shows off of YouTube. The incident caused YouTube to implement new policies to protect reviewers.

By Komla Kwao Published 22 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Hero Academia's UA Traitor was finally revealed after years of their identity being hinted at. In a surprise twist, Class 1-A's most dazzling hero, Aoyama Yuga, was revealed to be All For One's spy within the school. Aoyama took no pride in his job, referring to himself as a despicable villain once he was caught. He recently aided the heroes in their plan to entrap All For One, but a closer look at some of Aoyama's actions during the Provisional Hero License exam reveals he'd been trying to leave the villain boss's employ for quite some time. Shortly after the first test in the exam began, Class 1-A found themselves separated by the rumbling effect of Shindo's Vibrate Quirk. Since that test hinged on teamwork, most of them began to look for their classmates immediately after they regained their bearings. Interestingly, Aoyama chose to hide behind a rock until he was found by Tenya Iida. Aoyama's cowardice was quite uncharacteristic for a student of the hero course -- but it makes sense if he was intentionally trying to fail the exam.  RELATED: My Hero Academia Reboots as a Sports Anime for April Fools                  Unlike many of the other Class 1-A students, Aoyama has never shown any particularly strong desire to become a hero in MHA. He was born Quirkless, and as a child admired heroes as many others did. To allow their son to chase his dream, Aoyama\u2019s parents sought a Quirk for him from All For One -- but that gift came at a terrible price. The repayment demanded by the villain was their loyalty; he ordered Aoyama to enroll in UA and then forced him to leak sensitive information to the League of Villains. On the outside\u00a0the boy was living his dream life, but he continued to sink into deeper despair with every task he completed for AFO. Spying for All For One isn't a job one could just opt out of, but as Aoyama must have realized, it couldn't be helped if he was no longer around Class 1-A because he failed his Provisional License exam. Understanding that he no longer intended to pass the exam puts his lack of enthusiasm upon reuniting with Iida -- and his actions later on -- into perspective. Upon meeting Iida, Aoyama initially scoffed at his class rep's determination to locate all of 1-A before passing the test himself, but Iida's earnest desire to serve the class reminded him of his own dreams of being a hero. His classmate's\u00a0conviction triggered a flashback; young Aoyama was questioning his parents about why he was different. Before his traitor status and former Quirklessness\u00a0were revealed, it was natural to assume he was referencing his laser's side effect -- now it's clear that Aoyama was asking why he didn't have a Quirk like everyone else in My Hero Academia. RELATED: MHA Artist Shares Menacing New Dabi Portrait                  The duo traveled together, but the combined might of the other schools targeting UA meant their chances of passing were quite slim. Realizing he was slowing Iida down, Aoyama decided to sacrifice himself so his class rep could pass. He fired a continuous stream of his navel laser into the sky, creating a pillar of light that could be seen from every corner of the arena and making himself an obvious target.\u00a0He advised Iida to speed through the crowd that was heading toward them and take advantage of their tunnel vision to pass the test, but his plan backfired. Along with the rival schools that charged\u00a0for Aoyama, the Class 1-A students who hadn't passed the test yet recognized the laser all too well.

By Komla Kwao Published 22 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    My Hero Academia's UA Traitor was finally revealed after years of their identity being hinted at. In a surprise twist, Class 1-A's most dazzling hero, Aoyama Yuga, was revealed to be All For One's spy within the school. Aoyama took no pride in his job, referring to himself as a despicable villain once he was caught. He recently aided the heroes in their plan to entrap All For One, but a closer look at some of Aoyama's actions during the Provisional Hero License exam reveals he'd been trying to leave the villain boss's employ for quite some time. Shortly after the first test in the exam began, Class 1-A found themselves separated by the rumbling effect of Shindo's Vibrate Quirk. Since that test hinged on teamwork, most of them began to look for their classmates immediately after they regained their bearings. Interestingly, Aoyama chose to hide behind a rock until he was found by Tenya Iida. Aoyama's cowardice was quite uncharacteristic for a student of the hero course -- but it makes sense if he was intentionally trying to fail the exam.  RELATED: My Hero Academia Reboots as a Sports Anime for April Fools                  Unlike many of the other Class 1-A students, Aoyama has never shown any particularly strong desire to become a hero in MHA. He was born Quirkless, and as a child admired heroes as many others did. To allow their son to chase his dream, Aoyama\u2019s parents sought a Quirk for him from All For One -- but that gift came at a terrible price. The repayment demanded by the villain was their loyalty; he ordered Aoyama to enroll in UA and then forced him to leak sensitive information to the League of Villains. On the outside\u00a0the boy was living his dream life, but he continued to sink into deeper despair with every task he completed for AFO. Spying for All For One isn't a job one could just opt out of, but as Aoyama must have realized, it couldn't be helped if he was no longer around Class 1-A because he failed his Provisional License exam. Understanding that he no longer intended to pass the exam puts his lack of enthusiasm upon reuniting with Iida -- and his actions later on -- into perspective. Upon meeting Iida, Aoyama initially scoffed at his class rep's determination to locate all of 1-A before passing the test himself, but Iida's earnest desire to serve the class reminded him of his own dreams of being a hero. His classmate's\u00a0conviction triggered a flashback; young Aoyama was questioning his parents about why he was different. Before his traitor status and former Quirklessness\u00a0were revealed, it was natural to assume he was referencing his laser's side effect -- now it's clear that Aoyama was asking why he didn't have a Quirk like everyone else in My Hero Academia. RELATED: MHA Artist Shares Menacing New Dabi Portrait                  The duo traveled together, but the combined might of the other schools targeting UA meant their chances of passing were quite slim. Realizing he was slowing Iida down, Aoyama decided to sacrifice himself so his class rep could pass. He fired a continuous stream of his navel laser into the sky, creating a pillar of light that could be seen from every corner of the arena and making himself an obvious target.\u00a0He advised Iida to speed through the crowd that was heading toward them and take advantage of their tunnel vision to pass the test, but his plan backfired. Along with the rival schools that charged\u00a0for Aoyama, the Class 1-A students who hadn't passed the test yet recognized the laser all too well. In an instant, the whole class had assembled around Aoyama and Iida. Using their tried and tested combo moves against their opponents, they completely decimated their rivals. The reinforcements were exactly what Aoyama and Iida needed to turn the tide, and both managed to pass by the skin of their teeth. However, in contrast to his classmates' more jubilant expressions upon passing, Aoyama simply remarked pensively \"Well that means my twinkle won't stop, huh?\" His job for All For One hadn't come to an end yet.

Surprisingly, he shares many qualities with another villain protagonist.     By Ryan Bridges Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Eren Jaeger has unleashed the Wall Titans of Paradis and has begun his march on the world. Eren's plan to save Paradis will cost the lives of millions of innocent people and goes against everything that his friends stand for. Now that the Rumbling has started, Eren has solidified his position as Attack on Titan's true villain. Eren shares a lot of qualities with another villain protagonist: Light Yagami from Death Note. Both characters occupy a similar role in their respective stories. Light and Eren are characters with sympathetic goals, but the way they go about achieving these goals is heinous. Ever since Eren's heel turn, he has been acting more as Light would. Two of the most popular villain main characters in anime share a lot of similarities despite being from very different worlds.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan Both Light and Eren Want to Create a Perfect World                  One shared quality between Light and Eren is that both characters become disillusioned with the world. Light was disgusted with the level of crime and violence that plagued his world. Similarly, Eren was devastated to discover that the world of freedom he envisioned was marred by oppression and hatred. When the world didn't match the idealized version they wanted, both characters decided to do something about it. From the moment that Light received the Death Note, his goal was to create a world without injustice or evil. Light believes that he can make a world that has only good and honest people in it. This perfect world would be of his own design and follow his moral system. Light is ambitious and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. Eren's end goal is very similar to Light's; he wants to make a world of freedom where he and his friends can live how they want. Eren desires a world without walls where he and his friends can travel and see all the wonders they heard about as children. Creating this world of freedom is Eren's driving motivation, and just like Light, he is willing to do anything to make this a reality. Light and Eren are Manipulators                  These two villains understand that the world is not going to change just because they want it to. Some people oppose their plans and are ready to fight to the death to stop them. Eren and Light are willing to manipulate anyone, even their close friends and family, to get what they want. Both characters have displayed skills that make them master manipulators. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: How Floch Grew From a Coward to a Fearless Soldier Light spends most of the series deceiving those around him and using their trust to his advantage. He routinely abuses the love and trust that Misa has for him, often putting her in dangerous situations so that he can avoid the risk while progressing his plans. Light also exploits his father's position in the police to gain information on the investigation against him. To start the Rumbling, Eren needed access to an Eldian with royal blood. His half-brother Zeke fulfilled that need perfectly, so he became one of the many people that Eren would use. Eren lied to Zeke and convinced him that he supported the plan to euthanize all Eldians. When the time came to enact the plan, Eren betrayed his brother, overthrew the government and turned against his friends, all for his true goal. Both Eren and Light will ruthlessly use those around them no matter how close they may be. No Cost is Too High For Light and Eren                  The worlds that Light and Eren are trying to create require a massacre. An enormous amount of people will have to die to achieve their goals. The people that Eren and Light need to kill aren't just criminals or bigoted tyrants who might deserve death. Innocent people who have nothing to do with their plans will be sacrificed for their greater ambitions too. Regardless of the number of people who would die in the progress, both Eren and Light believe that the deaths are worth it. Throughout Death Note, Light kills scores of police officers and civilians who get in his way. Even those who aren't interfering in Light's plans might still find themselves sacrificed so that Light can avoid capture. Likewise, the Rumbling won't solely wipe out Marely; millions of children and other innocents who have never harmed an Eldian will die in the process. For these two villains, no amount of death and carnage is too high a price for their dreams to come true.

Surprisingly, he shares many qualities with another villain protagonist.     By Ryan Bridges Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Eren Jaeger has unleashed the Wall Titans of Paradis and has begun his march on the world. Eren's plan to save Paradis will cost the lives of millions of innocent people and goes against everything that his friends stand for. Now that the Rumbling has started, Eren has solidified his position as Attack on Titan's true villain. Eren shares a lot of qualities with another villain protagonist: Light Yagami from Death Note. Both characters occupy a similar role in their respective stories. Light and Eren are characters with sympathetic goals, but the way they go about achieving these goals is heinous. Ever since Eren's heel turn, he has been acting more as Light would. Two of the most popular villain main characters in anime share a lot of similarities despite being from very different worlds.  RELATED:\u00a0Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan Both Light and Eren Want to Create a Perfect World                  One shared quality between Light and Eren is that both characters become disillusioned with the world. Light was disgusted with the level of crime and violence that plagued his world. Similarly, Eren was devastated to discover that the world of freedom he envisioned was marred by oppression and hatred. When the world didn't match the idealized version they wanted, both characters decided to do something about it. From the moment that Light received the Death Note, his goal was to create a world without injustice or evil. Light believes that he can make a world that has only good and honest people in it. This perfect world would be of his own design and follow his moral system. Light is ambitious and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goal. Eren's end goal is very similar to Light's; he wants to make a world of freedom where he and his friends can live how they want. Eren desires a world without walls where he and his friends can travel and see all the wonders they heard about as children. Creating this world of freedom is Eren's driving motivation, and just like Light, he is willing to do anything to make this a reality. Light and Eren are Manipulators                  These two villains understand that the world is not going to change just because they want it to. Some people oppose their plans and are ready to fight to the death to stop them. Eren and Light are willing to manipulate anyone, even their close friends and family, to get what they want. Both characters have displayed skills that make them master manipulators. RELATED:\u00a0Attack on Titan: How Floch Grew From a Coward to a Fearless Soldier Light spends most of the series deceiving those around him and using their trust to his advantage. He routinely abuses the love and trust that Misa has for him, often putting her in dangerous situations so that he can avoid the risk while progressing his plans. Light also exploits his father's position in the police to gain information on the investigation against him. To start the Rumbling, Eren needed access to an Eldian with royal blood. His half-brother Zeke fulfilled that need perfectly, so he became one of the many people that Eren would use. Eren lied to Zeke and convinced him that he supported the plan to euthanize all Eldians. When the time came to enact the plan, Eren betrayed his brother, overthrew the government and turned against his friends, all for his true goal. Both Eren and Light will ruthlessly use those around them no matter how close they may be. No Cost is Too High For Light and Eren                  The worlds that Light and Eren are trying to create require a massacre. An enormous amount of people will have to die to achieve their goals. The people that Eren and Light need to kill aren't just criminals or bigoted tyrants who might deserve death. Innocent people who have nothing to do with their plans will be sacrificed for their greater ambitions too. Regardless of the number of people who would die in the progress, both Eren and Light believe that the deaths are worth it. Throughout Death Note, Light kills scores of police officers and civilians who get in his way. Even those who aren't interfering in Light's plans might still find themselves sacrificed so that Light can avoid capture. Likewise, the Rumbling won't solely wipe out Marely; millions of children and other innocents who have never harmed an Eldian will die in the process. For these two villains, no amount of death and carnage is too high a price for their dreams to come true.
