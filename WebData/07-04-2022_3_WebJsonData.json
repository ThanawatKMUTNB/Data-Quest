                     This is a good anime. \r Literally the only complaint I have with it is that the episodes are so ridiculously short and I wanted more from each episode. I honestly wouldn't even have complained if all the shorts were merged into one long episode. This is wholesomeness at its peak, and I feel like people don't realize that it is a REAL THING for a person to not be able to express their real feelings unless they are drunk. Osake wa Fuufu ni Natte kara is meant to be watched solely for the aspect of cuteness and wholesomeness that the shorts give with their characters and settings. I will say that if you're watching this with heavier expectations then leave while you still can, because it's a lighthearted and wholesome romantic short series that's meant to be watched, enjoyed, appreciated and allow you to move on with the rest of your day with a fluffy feeling in your heart. (Maybe you'll feel very sadly single, sorry, that's a you problem. You shouldn't be watching romance at all if that's the case) \r Story: ~ (how you gonna expect me to rate the story of an anime that doesn't have a plot?)\r Art: 8\r Sound: 8\r Character: 10\r Enjoyment: 10\r Overall: 10/10 without a doubt.

It is obviously, a lie that the government made up. There was never a season 2. Promised Neverland season 2 does not exist. Yakusoku no Neverland 2nd Season is a lie. If you are able to open your third eye and truly observe the simulated world around you, you can clearly see that none of this  season is real. By anaylizing the pixels in the 2773 frame of episode 3 we can clearly see that  the microphotonic light emmiting from the screen is in fact, not there, its actually an illusion thats being projected via the governments secret webcams in your computer.

Potential trigger warning for spoiler and in that spoiler mention of SA\r Oh no....here we go....\r So I watched this in 2020, but I just made the MAL account and really wanted to give this anime a review because of how strongly I disliked it.  \r This anime was such a slog to get through, I felt like I was wading through the densest of marshes, trudging along, and just absolutely miserable.  \r Story 2\r Holy cow, this story was....ridiculous. The web of love triangle felt so complicated, I made a fricken diagram. It seems that everyone loves everyone, and it was so annoying. It's one big drama fest and it felt as there was no payoff or any satisfaction to anything.  \r Art 6\r Okay here is the one \"bright spot\" in the anime and by bright spot I mean the anime wasn't horrendous looking. I liked the transitions and color splotches of people's feelings. The art was fine.  \r Sound 4\r Not much to say, the sound was decent.  \r Character 2\r None of the characters were LIKEABLE or even really relatable, they were missing any sort of realistic element, like caricatures of humans. I can understand using intimacy as a coping method for a multitude of reasons, and at the same time so many of these characters motivations were so convoluted and entangled beyond just using people for sex/intimacy that it became unbelievable. The characters are written to such a degree of extra, every problem they have has to be like magnified to such a stupid degree.  It never felt like the characters did anything that redeemed their terrible actions.  Some of the scenes were so uncomfortable, and like consent was missing in some of the more explicit scenes. Again it felt as though consequences were missing and people's actions didn't really hold all that much weight.  \r It was just kinda disgusting. \r Conclusion\r I would not recommend this anime, the only reason I would recommend it is because sometimes it is fun to get mad at television, sometimes it is fun to watch garbage with others and enjoy their reactions. The story was awful, the characters were downright non-sensical and just shitty. There was nothing really about this anime that felt redeeming except maybe the art which as said before was alright, I liked the transitions.

The story was awful, the characters were downright non-sensical and just shitty. There was nothing really about this anime that felt redeeming except maybe the art which as said before was alright, I liked the transitions.

The web of love triangle felt so complicated, I made a fricken diagram. It seems that everyone loves everyone, and it was so annoying. It's one big drama fest and it felt as there was no payoff or any satisfaction to anything.  \r Art 6\r Okay here is the one \"bright spot\" in the anime and by bright spot I mean the anime wasn't horrendous looking. I liked the transitions and color splotches of people's feelings. The art was fine.  \r Sound 4\r Not much to say, the sound was decent.  \r Character 2\r None of the characters were LIKEABLE or even really relatable, they were missing any sort of realistic element, like caricatures of humans. I can understand using intimacy as a coping method for a multitude of reasons, and at the same time so many of these characters motivations were so convoluted and entangled beyond just using people for sex/intimacy that it became unbelievable. The characters are written to such a degree of extra, every problem they have has to be like magnified to such a stupid degree.  It never felt like the characters did anything that redeemed their terrible actions.  Some of the scenes were so uncomfortable, and like consent was missing in some of the more explicit scenes. Again it felt as though consequences were missing and people's actions didn't really hold all that much weight.  \r It was just kinda disgusting. \r Conclusion\r I would not recommend this anime, the only reason I would recommend it is because sometimes it is fun to get mad at television, sometimes it is fun to watch garbage with others and enjoy their reactions. The story was awful, the characters were downright non-sensical and just shitty. There was nothing really about this anime that felt redeeming except maybe the art which as said before was alright, I liked the transitions.
