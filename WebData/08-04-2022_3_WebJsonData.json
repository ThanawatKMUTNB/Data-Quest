i started watching this anime as the first episode came out, honestly i was pretty interested. i'm a sucker for romance, so i was excited to see what this anime had to offer. \r the story itself is pretty good! a popular girl who wants to cosplay, and a loner guy who enjoys making hina dolls, both bond over making cosplays. it has nice messages behind it, mainly talking about how you shouldn't feel ashamed about your hobbies, and things like that. it's not the BEST romance i've ever watched, but it isn't the worst either. \r however, there are two things that really sucked while watching my dress up darling: \r 1. the fanservice \r there is WAY too much fanservice in this anime, it starts very small in the first episode. little things that make you uncomfortable, but are short enough scenes for you to ignore in the long run,,, but it gets much heavier the more you continue watching. like, there's literally a whole episode dedicated to fanservice. it's THAT bad. \r 2. the fanbase.  \r i know, i know. you shouldn't let a fanbase change your opinion about an anime or manga,, but hear me out! people WORSHIP this show, and i get it. to each their own yk? but jesus fucking christ, these people swear that my dress up darling is a 10/10 anime, and bash anyone who has any type of critisicm towards it. unfortunately, that lowered my opinion about the show a bit. \r the anime was good, but it could've been a little better. it was a cute watch, but it doesn't even come close to other romance anime i've seen (e.g. kamisama kiss). so overall, i liked it, but i feel like there's too much hype that might raise your expectations for what this anime really is. i genuinely wonder if the anime would've been this hyped & this popular if it had no fanservice in it, but i know i definitely would've enjoyed the show more that way.

expecting something particularly good out of it or not. You should know that this show had severe time constraints which lead to serious production issues, to the point that even the key animation director manifested his pessimism towards the series on a personal Twitter account. Considering this context, the reader is invited to investigate the matter and I will not add another negative comment about the production to the existing pile. \r Regardless, I will say I had fun watching this series and I was genuinely surprised at the amount of interesting concepts and characters they managed to include despite the aforementioned problems (though I'm a little biased towards the sci-fi genre). However, these same characters and concepts never get fully explored, and the show lacks in providing a strong or specific message about anything that sticks to your memory. Many of the themes revolve around philosophical issues that humanity will likely face in one way or another in the future, such as how accurately can we predict incidents or accidents within society; how preventable these situations are; and how should we ethically respond to that knowledge. Yet, the anime either never had the time to or was never interested in exploring these themes in a fulfilling manner \u2014 it feels more like an introductory class on philosophy and technology. The characters that participate in the story, while some likable and believable, are not very deep either, and will sometimes act only in favor of the plot, with no prior indication that their behavior was in line with their mindset or moral beliefs (this is because we never get to know those things in detail, or they are simply not there). \r It saddens me that the show never got to seize its full potential, for it had enough good ideas behind it that it could make up a long and iconic series had it tried to be one. However, due to the rush of the current industry and most likely a lack of inspiration from low-spirited animators and writers, it was never meant to be something great. \r If you like futuristic narratives and want to watch something off the genre for entertainment, then I'd recommend it as long as the sadly very unpolished animation and frequently off-model characters don't bother you (as well some other VFX issues, such as a low quality blur on the screen in various frames). But if you worry about good animation and expect to engage in a complex story or become familiar with three dimensional characters, this show will probably only disappoint you.

Definitely one of the top anime this season, it's so sad to see the last episode finally here. I really enjoyed watching Wakana and Marin's relationship and I like how it's gotten more noticeable that Wakana's starting to see her romantically although he is not aware of it yet. \r I really liked the fireworks scene because he really realized how much Marin has opened the world for me, he's experienced so much because of her and I'm so happy she eventually told him they'll get to lots more together next year. \r It was funny to see Wakana captivated by Marin's appearance in a yukata, she did look mesmerizing with this new look and I thought it was funny how when she realized her nape was getting Wakana bit hot she tried to appeal to him so much with it. \r Lol, I loved the twist that Wakana was completely fine with the scary movie but Marin was not and Wakana had his craftsmanship mode on, trying to figure out what materials were used and how they did the make-up, that was so relatable. \r And with that, it's come to an end.\r I know we were all hoping he was secretly awake. I also know that we all are hoping that the \"see you later\" was her saying \"to be continued\" \r A really satisfactory wholesome ending. Loved the anime as a whole. Watching the spicy wholesomeness was definitely a treat. Beautifully drawn and animated too. \r Hoping it gets a new season soon because this was such a fun ride! I really hope to see Wakana and Marin again.\r Till then I'll keep up with the manga.

this review) has been on my plan to watch for a long time now. 2016 was definitely the year of MyHeroAcademia, the first anime i\u00b4ve ever seen. What i did not know at the time was that this was not Studio Bones only anime in 2016. Being a massive fan of the studio i was eager to finally check out Bungou Stray Dogs... \r Story - 6/10 \r During this first season there was no clear objektive that our main characters were working towards. It felt more like a series of introductory episodes where our main cast gets time to shine. However i think this series could have used much longer arcs instead of only one episode per member to really establish their personalities. The series constantly switches from drama to mystery to comedy in a way that makes the pacing of the show feel really uneven. That in itself would\u00b4nt really be a problem for this kind of show but the problem is that none of those aspects feel polished in any way. There are the battle-shounen elements that were really fun to watch but very rarely seen. The mystery element is very weak and pales in comparison to something like Kindaichi or Hyouka. The comedy however i really enjoyed. This might only be my personal opinion because i heard a lot of people online saying that the show was not funny but i have to disagree on that. This show DOES have the potential to be better in this department because all the groundwork is done ,and i am really looking forward to the next seasons! \r Art - 8/10 \r BSD has a very unique look to it. The different tones of brown and white do remind me of old british detective storys.This gives the anime a strong sence of visual identity. The character designs are great with the standout being the beatifully drawn diamond-shaped eyes. The design of the different abilities were great with my favorite being the \"Rashomon\". The battles are fluid and well drawn. I always have to give Bones credit for their skill to manage these sequnces without the use of 3D CGI. I wish there were more of them. \r Sound - 7/10 \r The soundtrack in itself is pretty average which hurts my soul because it could have been so much better. I think if they used a more classy orchestrated soundtrack it would have fitted the look and feel of the anime way better than the one they used. The opening was a plus , because it really grew on me over time. The ending is also great although nothing special. Definitely room for improvement here. \r Characters - 8/10 \r The strongest category. Osamu Dazai is carrying this category with his entertaining personality. He has three moods, gentleman, playboy and suicidal. He and Kunikida are the reason why the comedy in this show is so good. Their chemistry is fantastic and you really buy the fact that they are partners who have known each other for a long time. Ranpo Edogawa and Akiko Yosano were also standouts. Our main character was alright. He grew on my over time but i still have the feeling that he doesn\u00b4t quite fit in with the rest yet. I really liked Akutagawa as a villain (He looks like if Ken Kaneki and Fumikage Tokoyami had a kid). The german voice actor was amazing. I really hope they give him more time to shine in future seasons. \r Enjoyment - 8/10 \r Despite the roughly paced story,i found most of the episodes really enjoyable. I think episode 10 would have made a better ending to this season than episode 12 ,but i liked the setup they did in the last scenes. Im looking forward to watch the next season as soon as i can! This mix of genres can truly be enjoyed by everyone,so please give it a chance! \r - Marco_Yooo \r FiNAL SCORE - 7/10              Helpful       report                          ", "      ", "    ", "  ", "", "MyAnimeList.net      Hide AdsLoginSign Up  AllAnimeMangaCharactersPeopleCompaniesManga StoreNewsFeatured ArticlesForumClubsUsers               View all results for ${ keyword }  Anime  Anime Search Top Anime Seasonal Anime Videos Reviews Recommendations 2022 ChallengeFantasy Anime League  Manga  Manga Search Top Manga Manga Store Reviews Recommendations 2022 Challenge   Community  Interest Stacks Forums Clubs Blogs Users   Industry  News Featured Articles People Characters Companies MAL\u00d7Japan   Watch  Episode Videos Anime Trailers  Read  Manga Store   Help  About Support Advertising FAQ Report StaffMAL Supporter     Reviews                Top                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Anime                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Bungou Stray Dogs                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Reviews                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Marco_Yooo's Review                               Apr 7, 2022                    12 of 12 episodes seen                 Overall Rating:         7          Bungou Stray Dogs  (Anime) add            (All reviews)                         Marco_Yooo (All reviews)   0                people found this review helpful                           more pics      Overall 7   Story 6   Animation 8   Sound 7   Character 8   Enjoyment 8                              THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW \r Bungou Stray Dogs (I will call it BSD in this review) has been on my plan to watch for a long time now. 2016 was definitely the year of MyHeroAcademia, the first anime i\u00b4ve ever seen.

The character designs are great with the standout being the beatifully drawn diamond-shaped eyes. The design of the different abilities were great with my favorite being the \"Rashomon\". The battles are fluid and well drawn. I always have to give Bones credit for their skill to manage these sequnces without the use of 3D CGI. I wish there were more of them. \r Sound - 7/10 \r The soundtrack in itself is pretty average which hurts my soul because it could have been so much better. I think if they used a more classy orchestrated soundtrack it would have fitted the look and feel of the anime way better than the one they used. The opening was a plus , because it really grew on me over time. The ending is also great although nothing special. Definitely room for improvement here. \r Characters - 8/10 \r The strongest category. Osamu Dazai is carrying this category with his entertaining personality. He has three moods, gentleman, playboy and suicidal. He and Kunikida are the reason why the comedy in this show is so good. Their chemistry is fantastic and you really buy the fact that they are partners who have known each other for a long time. Ranpo Edogawa and Akiko Yosano were also standouts. Our main character was alright. He grew on my over time but i still have the feeling that he doesn\u00b4t quite fit in with the rest yet. I really liked Akutagawa as a villain (He looks like if Ken Kaneki and Fumikage Tokoyami had a kid). The german voice actor was amazing. I really hope they give him more time to shine in future seasons. \r Enjoyment - 8/10 \r Despite the roughly paced story,i found most of the episodes really enjoyable. I think episode 10 would have made a better ending to this season than episode 12 ,but i liked the setup they did in the last scenes. Im looking forward to watch the next season as soon as i can! This mix of genres can truly be enjoyed by everyone,so please give it a chance! \r - Marco_Yooo \r FiNAL SCORE - 7/10              Helpful       report      ", "               Top                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Anime                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Bungou Stray Dogs                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Reviews                           \u00a0 > \u00a0               Marco_Yooo's Review                           ", "               Top                           ", "               Anime                           ", "               Bungou Stray Dogs                           ", "               Reviews                           ", "               Marco_Yooo's Review                           ", "   Apr 7, 2022                    12 of 12 episodes seen                 Overall Rating:         7          Bungou Stray Dogs  (Anime) add            (All reviews)                         Marco_Yooo (All reviews)   0                people found this review helpful                           more pics      Overall 7   Story 6   Animation 8   Sound 7   Character 8   Enjoyment 8                              THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW \r Bungou Stray Dogs (I will call it BSD in this review) has been on my plan to watch for a long time now. 2016 was definitely the year of MyHeroAcademia, the first anime i\u00b4ve ever seen. What i did not know at the time was that this was not Studio Bones only anime in 2016. Being a massive fan of the studio i was eager to finally check out Bungou Stray Dogs... \r Story - 6/10 \r During this first season there was no clear objektive that our main characters were working towards. It felt more like a series of introductory episodes where our main cast gets time to shine. However i think this series could have used much longer arcs instead of only one episode per member to really establish their personalities. The series constantly switches from drama to mystery to comedy in a way that makes the pacing of the show feel really uneven. That in itself would\u00b4nt really be a problem for this kind of show but the problem is that none of those aspects feel polished in any way. There are the battle-shounen elements that were really fun to watch but very rarely seen. The mystery element is very weak and pales in comparison to something like Kindaichi or Hyouka. The comedy however i really enjoyed. This might only be my personal opinion because i heard a lot of people online saying that the show was not funny but i have to disagree on that.
