Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

I mean, shonen demographic manga are also full of tropes but you can always find more entertainment in them in general compared to shojo manga.           I don't think that's fair. You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

This exactly. My favorite anime of all time is Natsume's Book of Friends, and I also love shoujo magical girl shows and idol shows. Fruits Basket, Kakuriyo: Bed and Breakfast for Spirits and Kamisama Kiss are all excellent shoujo romances.         Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.
