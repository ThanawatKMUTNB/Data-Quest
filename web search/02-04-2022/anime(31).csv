Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Well if we’re being technical going to hell or heaven is considered starting a new life.

Unfortunate though that some “parents” refuse to do this sometimes leaving it up for the kids to do so themselves “hopefully”.

Quote:    It is not suicide, it is going to start a new life.               idea of afterlife is present in most major religions and systems of belief for millennia. We should never restrict fiction on the basis on someone's kid being brought up without any common sense. I've heard of cases of children trying to fly like superheroes do and dying or almost dying, will you lobby to remove flying from common superpowers as well?

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Unfortunate though that some “parents” refuse to do this sometimes leaving it up for the kids to do so themselves “hopefully”.

We should never restrict fiction on the basis on someone's kid being brought up without any common sense.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Unfortunate though that some “parents” refuse to do this sometimes leaving it up for the kids to do so themselves “hopefully”.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Well if we’re being technical going to hell or heaven is considered starting a new life.

Unfortunate though that some “parents” refuse to do this sometimes leaving it up for the kids to do so themselves “hopefully”.

Did you know, not everyone hit by a truck in anime gets sent to some fantasy world? Some just die.   Things to learn from this:  1. Remember to look both ways before crossing the street.  2. Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4. Death is not a revolving door or a transportation device to another world.  5. If you think truck-kun is after you, best to become a hikikomori. Your chances for survival increase dramatically.

Do not stand in the street.  3. If you see someone else in the street that is about to get struck, your chances of saving them is low, and it is possible that the accident will instead have 2 casualties instead of 1.  4.

With this, the April Fool's joke is even funnier haha.   I honestly don't remember much about it. I remember liking Yoshino (and being voiced by Inori Minase) and a commando girl. Ah, there was also a rather feminine guy... and a fat guy in the last arc.   Anyway, it's interesting how series we thought were forgotten are making a comeback.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.8            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.8            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Requiem of the Rose King Episode 12  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Requiem of the Rose King ?                     Community score: 3.8            Now we approach the winter of our discontent, which is to say that this episode brings us out of Henry VI Part Three and into Richard III in terms of source material. That seems fitting for the finale of the first part of the series as it marks an emotional turning point for Richard. He has only recently realized that he loves Henry, only to find out that his love is in fact the man he blames for York's death (even if it was actually Margaret), that Anne has betrayed him, and that his Edward was actually the prince, all in almost the same breath. It's a lot to handle even if you aren't as emotionally unstable as Richard is after years of his mother's emotional abuse, and the return of his abuser into his life certainly isn't going to help him to cope with anything.    And so he turns to violence, which has become his go-to method for coping with things he can't actually handle. We've seen evidence of that from early episodes; while Richard is more than capable of emotional manipulation and other forms of machination, the Wars of the Roses have mostly offered him a bloody way out of his perceived helplessness. Even if he hadn't experienced some sort of psychotic break after the death of his father (which is debatable) he's not in a great position of mental health, and when we saw him run Prince Edward through, it looked an awful lot like the frustration of his miserable situation simply overwhelming him. He was lashing out in response to emotional pain, and that's what he does again when he visits Henry in the Tower – when Henry begins repeating Cecily's words about how cursed and evil Richard is and how the world would rue the day of his birth, Richard can't handle it. He's once again hearing hatred spewed from a mouth that should have spoken of love (and in this case actually did), and the only thing that he can think to do in the moment is to just make it stop.    What makes this particularly awful is that kissing Richard and moving their relationship from the (perception of) platonic to romantic is what causes Henry to begin repeating Cecily in the first place. Henry was traumatized by his mother Queen Catherine's affair, which in Requiem of the Rose King caused him to instead embrace as sexless a life as he could manage, believing it to be more pure and honest than an act that made his mother say such awful things. But when he kisses Richard, he's forced to accept that he also has those lusts within him, something he's been denying for a very long time, and all of that old trauma comes rushing back. His words are less an indictment of Richard and more an agony directed at himself for breaking from his beliefs. Unfortunately for him, Richard has his own trauma, and hearing the man he loves repeat his mother's imprecations is more than he can handle, especially right now.    It is, however, worth remembering what Catesby said to him before he forced his way into the Tower – that he had prepared a corpse to look like Henry. We do see Richard stab Henry and Henry fall over, but we never specifically see Henry's dead body, and when Anne is weeping by the red rose-draped coffin in the forest, Richard is quick to tell her that this is not Henry. Anne interprets that as Henry's mortal shell – that which made him “Henry” – having left, but strictly speaking, that may not be what Richard means. As well, I could see the series playing with the fact that Henry VI was interred in Chertsey Abbey but later moved to Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel by Richard III as a means to back up the potential idea of Henry only being mostly dead.    In any event, the title for this episode tells things truly: the Richard we've known thus far may well be dead, or at least on his way towards dying. Anne may be able to help salvage what's left of his gentleness (even if she does appear to be in the early stages of pregnancy), but right now that doesn't feel all that likely. It seems instead that he's beginning to embody some of the last words he speaks to Henry in Henry VI Part Three: “And this word 'love,' which greybeards call divine,/ Be resident in men like one another/ And not in me: I am myself alone.”    “I am myself alone.” Does that mean that he is no one but himself? Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Or that he feels himself alone and friendless, adrift in an unwelcoming world? Either could be true. Time will show us which it is.

Interest Crunchyroll: Shojo Anime Genre Has Strong Growth Potential   posted on 2022-03-31 23:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Titles aimed at female audiences over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply    Crunchyroll held a business seminar on Tuesday aimed at Japanese businesses. Part of the presentation centered on explaining current consumer trends in the west based on the service's viewership numbers. Chief Customer Officer Asa Suehira explained that while shonen battle anime and ""isekai"" fantasy series continue to dominate, anime aimed at a female audience have strong growth potential. He stated that these titles tend to over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply, citing Fruits Basket as an example.    ""In the west, where female anime fans were underserved with relevant content historically, shojo, josei, and even some BL titles are showing stronger performances than expected,"" he said. Fans of idol anime shouldn't get their hopes up, however, as female-targeted idol anime were singled out as the exception to this trend.    Nevertheless, Crunchyroll's data indicates that tastes among anime fans are becoming more varied, although Suehira did note that it can be harder to predict which of those titles will become hits. He also remarked that well-produced romantic comedies aimed at male audiences, such as My Dress-Up Darling, have also been on the rise in recent years, with such titles even cracking the top 5 in a given season.    Suehira further challenged the assumption that only fantasy and action shows perform well on the platform by displaying a pie chart of anime genres represented by Crunchyroll in 2021. He noted that slice of life, comedy, and drama ""take up a big slice of the pie,"" although he did not state the percentages.

Interest Crunchyroll: Shojo Anime Genre Has Strong Growth Potential   posted on 2022-03-31 23:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Titles aimed at female audiences over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply    Crunchyroll held a business seminar on Tuesday aimed at Japanese businesses. Part of the presentation centered on explaining current consumer trends in the west based on the service's viewership numbers. Chief Customer Officer Asa Suehira explained that while shonen battle anime and ""isekai"" fantasy series continue to dominate, anime aimed at a female audience have strong growth potential. He stated that these titles tend to over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply, citing Fruits Basket as an example.    ""In the west, where female anime fans were underserved with relevant content historically, shojo, josei, and even some BL titles are showing stronger performances than expected,"" he said. Fans of idol anime shouldn't get their hopes up, however, as female-targeted idol anime were singled out as the exception to this trend.    Nevertheless, Crunchyroll's data indicates that tastes among anime fans are becoming more varied, although Suehira did note that it can be harder to predict which of those titles will become hits. He also remarked that well-produced romantic comedies aimed at male audiences, such as My Dress-Up Darling, have also been on the rise in recent years, with such titles even cracking the top 5 in a given season.    Suehira further challenged the assumption that only fantasy and action shows perform well on the platform by displaying a pie chart of anime genres represented by Crunchyroll in 2021. He noted that slice of life, comedy, and drama ""take up a big slice of the pie,"" although he did not state the percentages. He encouraged Japanese partners to work with Crunchyroll as a hub for all anime, especially in light of the Funimation merger. The presentation also highlighted Crunchyroll's extensive marketing efforts and community outreach.    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.

Interest Crunchyroll: Shojo Anime Genre Has Strong Growth Potential   posted on 2022-03-31 23:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Titles aimed at female audiences over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply    Crunchyroll held a business seminar on Tuesday aimed at Japanese businesses. Part of the presentation centered on explaining current consumer trends in the west based on the service's viewership numbers. Chief Customer Officer Asa Suehira explained that while shonen battle anime and ""isekai"" fantasy series continue to dominate, anime aimed at a female audience have strong growth potential. He stated that these titles tend to over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply, citing Fruits Basket as an example.    ""In the west, where female anime fans were underserved with relevant content historically, shojo, josei, and even some BL titles are showing stronger performances than expected,"" he said. Fans of idol anime shouldn't get their hopes up, however, as female-targeted idol anime were singled out as the exception to this trend.    Nevertheless, Crunchyroll's data indicates that tastes among anime fans are becoming more varied, although Suehira did note that it can be harder to predict which of those titles will become hits. He also remarked that well-produced romantic comedies aimed at male audiences, such as My Dress-Up Darling, have also been on the rise in recent years, with such titles even cracking the top 5 in a given season.    Suehira further challenged the assumption that only fantasy and action shows perform well on the platform by displaying a pie chart of anime genres represented by Crunchyroll in 2021. He noted that slice of life, comedy, and drama ""take up a big slice of the pie,"" although he did not state the percentages. He encouraged Japanese partners to work with Crunchyroll as a hub for all anime, especially in light of the Funimation merger. The presentation also highlighted Crunchyroll's extensive marketing efforts and community outreach.    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.

Interest Crunchyroll: Shojo Anime Genre Has Strong Growth Potential   posted on 2022-03-31 23:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Titles aimed at female audiences over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply    Crunchyroll held a business seminar on Tuesday aimed at Japanese businesses. Part of the presentation centered on explaining current consumer trends in the west based on the service's viewership numbers. Chief Customer Officer Asa Suehira explained that while shonen battle anime and ""isekai"" fantasy series continue to dominate, anime aimed at a female audience have strong growth potential. He stated that these titles tend to over-perform due to unmet demand from low supply, citing Fruits Basket as an example.    ""In the west, where female anime fans were underserved with relevant content historically, shojo, josei, and even some BL titles are showing stronger performances than expected,"" he said. Fans of idol anime shouldn't get their hopes up, however, as female-targeted idol anime were singled out as the exception to this trend.    Nevertheless, Crunchyroll's data indicates that tastes among anime fans are becoming more varied, although Suehira did note that it can be harder to predict which of those titles will become hits. He also remarked that well-produced romantic comedies aimed at male audiences, such as My Dress-Up Darling, have also been on the rise in recent years, with such titles even cracking the top 5 in a given season.    Suehira further challenged the assumption that only fantasy and action shows perform well on the platform by displaying a pie chart of anime genres represented by Crunchyroll in 2021. He noted that slice of life, comedy, and drama ""take up a big slice of the pie,"" although he did not state the percentages. He encouraged Japanese partners to work with Crunchyroll as a hub for all anime, especially in light of the Funimation merger. The presentation also highlighted Crunchyroll's extensive marketing efforts and community outreach.    Funimation and Crunchyroll announced on March 1 that that Funimation and Wakanim's anime library and simulcast content have moved to Crunchyroll. Sony's Funimation Global Group completed its acquisition of Crunchyroll from AT&T on August 9 last year. The purchase price was US$1.175 billion, and the proceeds were paid in cash at closing.

I think it was the other way around, the way he was leading up to it made it sound like he was doing that (Saying stuff like, 'doing this may cast me out of society/create hardship/etc.') so that's what people were saying was gonna happen.  Which honestly would have been the least surprising reveal ever but then it ended up being this troll.   Such an Ikuni thing to do.

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

I think it was the other way around, the way he was leading up to it made it sound like he was doing that (Saying stuff like, 'doing this may cast me out of society/create hardship/etc.') so that's what people were saying was gonna happen.

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

I think it was the other way around, the way he was leading up to it made it sound like he was doing that (Saying stuff like, 'doing this may cast me out of society/create hardship/etc.') so that's what people were saying was gonna happen.

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

Yeah, with Ikuhara, you can never be entirely sure that this isn't an elaborate joke he is pulling on you. (See Miki's stopwatch contains the secrets of the universe, He wanted to kill Tuxedo Mask, The Penguindrum is a washing machine, etc)   But I'm more than willingly to go all with it serious or not and call him Bonsoir from now on if that is his wish.

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

In comparison to some of the stuff Gainax put out, his work in comparison is quite normal. FLCL for example was really queer, with robots coming out of peoples heads and a giant iron in the middle of the town.

And then there’s announcing it on Trans Day of Visibility, too.           Still, he didn't come out as trans but as Bonsoir Ikuhara. If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.      Quote:    Also Ikuhara's works are so infused with queerness that honestly, him actually being queer probably wouldn't be that big of a surprise to a lot of people.           I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

If he knows that Trans Day of Visibility is a thing (I didn't, until last year) this looks more like a ""har har coming out getit"" joke than anything. If he doesn't, it just looks like what it does, him assuming a new name for whatever reason, with a jokey garnish.

I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

I think it's more like some people really want to claim him as their ""own"", and claiming to know intimate things about about a real person that he never actually disclosed or insinuated, just because they really want them to be true, is frankly quite creepy to me. (And that's beside my own problems with people worshipping Ikuhara as a queer icon.)

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 Episode 12  by Christopher Farris, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            I'd hardly call it the comeback of the century or anything, but it still seems pretty impressive how far the Arifureta anime has come since its incredibly iffy inception. After multiple studio switchovers and a first-season opening that seemed to misrepresent the tonal appeal of the series, here we've arrived at the wrap party for its second season, finishing in a mostly satisfying, effective way. While it's fine for me, I guess I mostly find myself hoping this has worked well for fans of the original work, ending up with a solid adaptation that supplements their appreciation for the novel after all. This isn't even the actual end for Arifureta either, as we've already got confirmation that there's an OVA coming later this year. Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Which makes sense, given that the story is hardly over by the point of this season finale. But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

But much like Hajime's growth from a 'commonplace' weakling to an overpowered edgelord badass, the anime's glow-up from the murky, shambling mess it originally was into a perfectly serviceable little fantasy cartoon makes for an appreciable journey all its own.    Simply taking stock of the state of the product is appropriate enough at this stopping point, since so much of this season finale similarly spends its time consolidating the leftover pieces of the big blowout of the last few episodes. The biggest dangling thread is almost certainly the fate of Kaori, but as I was last week, the storyline is so assured that she'll be 'fine' that the characters straight-up turn to the camera and tell us that before sending Hajime over on a few other personal diversions. Instead, the actual biggest return on an emotional investment comes from Ai-Chan-Sensei, which probably isn't that surprising to anyone who's been paying attention through this arc, but is still nice to see just for a sense of completion.    Part of Ai-Sensei's focus here is necessarily on her processing the guilt over the people killed around and as a result of her in this battle. So she's got to come to terms with the church full of people she leveled, or the fact that Hiyama's demise, played somewhat flippantly as it occurred last episode, was still an instance of one of her students dying, so she's a bit tore up by that as well. What's nice here is that Hajime's contribution to talking Sensei through these feelings isn't to insist on his personal method of burying any trauma beneath a badass facade, but instead advising her to hold onto the weight and importance of that guilt. The association he asks for on it could come off like Hajime basically asking Sensei to perform emotional labor for him, but to hear him tell it, his experiences thus far have left him unsure if he even can still experience those human extremes of emotions anymore. Of course, our boy's actions regarding his teammates, friends, and the likes of Myu indicate that he's handling things more healthily than he's giving himself credit for, but the concern being there at all still rings true, and fits with Hajime's desire to have a 'way back' for himself, both in terms of physically returning to Japan and living therein apart from his current vengeful disposition.    It's that long-term mission statement I've always appreciated about Arifureta, a power-fantasy makeover isekai that nonetheless sets its hero's ultimate goal of getting back to his original life after all. And given Sensei's long-standing willingness to shoulder these kinds of burdens for all her students, it fits, and continues the unique reciprocal relationship between her and Hajime. Where her presence and faith in him has comforted Hajime in the background of his struggles so far, he gets to return the favor here by turning his back on her only to allow her to cry into it in the event of being overwhelmed by her own struggles. That alone speaks to Hajime not being as callous as he'd like everyone to think he is. How moe.    I'm glad this closer can provide that kind of emotional closure, as the rest is more mechanical plot stuff getting sorted out for future stories. Kaori does indeed survive, with the outlandish side-effect of having her soul moved into the defeated Noint's body in the process, in a power-up acquisition so out there I absolutely didn't see it coming from this story. They even expressly detail that the move was entirely Kaori's desire and her old body is fine in stasis and ready for her to migrate back to once everything's taken care of. I kind of appreciate how buck-wild this is just as an expression of the lengths Kaori is now willing to go to in service of Hajime's adventuring harem. Something to be said for conviction, I suppose, and the animation here does a decent job of communicating it's still Kaori through facial expressions and the like, so it mostly works.    The other big shift that happens at this stage in the story comes from Hajime finally bringing everyone else up on that whole ""The gods are evil jerks"" thing, and a huge collection of the classmate crew resultantly deciding to tag along with him on the next leg of his adventures. I'm rather more apprehensive about this development, least of all because of the crowd factor involved (how are they all going to fit in the Hummvee?!), even if I can see the reasoning for it within the storytelling. For one thing, most of these people are going to have way more basis to interact with Eri the next time she pops up as a dedicated villain. Plus it's another point that acts with Hajime's arc from his original forced ousting from the group. Yes there's something a bit obvious about him suddenly finding that everyone thinks he is cool and wants to be his friend, but so long as the story isn't leaning too hard on Hajime reveling in vengeful vindication over the turnaround and is instead simply acting adorably tsundere over the whole affair, I think it's fine. I guess we'll just have to wait until that OVA (and who knows what other anime extensions) to see how this setup is actually going to shake out.    To the end, Arifureta is still Arifureta, so even among all its emotional satisfaction and interesting status-quo shakeups, this finale still can't finish without, say, a scene where all of Hajime's wives feed him or Tio, as she always does, returning to the bit about dragon sodomy. ""I've never been so uncomfortable"" indeed. But while I don't know if 'respectable' is a term I'd associate with all of that, it still all feels assured enough. I left the first season of Arifureta with a surprising amount of hope for its future, and I now leave the second season reasonably satisfied with the fulfillment of that hope. It's hardly the ""World's Strongest"", but I don't think there's any shame in going from Commonplace to Decently Entertaining.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 2.9            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 2.9            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 2.9            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 2.9            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?

Tokyo 24th Ward Episode 11  by Christopher Farris, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Tokyo 24th Ward ?                     Community score: 2.9            One thing I haven't yet made space to mention much regarding Tokyo 24th Ward is how the whole storyline actually feels very video game-y. Specifically it has a lot of the earmarks of the kinds of visual novels Vio Shimokura has experience writing for at Nitroplus. You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

You could see the expositional conversations across the long time-frame of the story being punctuated with more immediate choice-based 'gameplay' in the Asumi-call/Trolley-problem segments, probably facilitated with some gameplay mechanics based off allocating the stats of the RGB boys' specifically-heightened abilities. And this whole stupid thing might have worked better in such a format. Games, after all, have more parameters of action to be judged on than simply digesting the narrative of a story we're getting from the one telling it. Persona 5 ended up having some rather misguided musings on the nature of societal rebellion and the justice system, but it still worked as a video game because it was great fun to play. But alas, Tokyo 24th Ward is not a game like Persona 5, it's an anime like PERSONA 5 the Animation, meaning we're stuck simply having to watch it and judge its story without any interactive flourishes to distract us.    Still, I have to bring such a potentially-mechanical consideration up as this (hopefully) penultimate episode gears up for the story's ending by handing Shu one last plot device and explicitly describing to him the parameters for whatever ending he's trying to reach on this run. Speaking of Shin Megami Tensei spin-offs, I started reviewing this series by wryly referring to Koki and Ran's ends of the story's political spectrum as the 'Law' and 'Chaos' factions, but seeing this fork specifically described to Shu like he's hovering over the final selection button in a game's narrative really drives it home. Except it feels like one of those poorly-considered final decisions foisted on a player for the sake of feeling like an impactful culmination of everything that led them here.    The personal component of Shu's consideration feels like a six-of-one/half-dozen-of-another situation, with the confirmation that Asumi is irrevocably brain-dead and he's just to make the call of putting her consciousness into an everlasting coma, or destroying her existence completely. But even that comes off as seismic in the face of the societal side-effects Shu is supposedly reckoning with in what each choice will mean for the KANAE system. I think this is primarily an issue of how laughably lopsided Tokyo 24th Ward's attempts at 'both sides'-ing this narrative continue to be. It's been repeatedly confirmed that Hazard Cast and the KANAE system are pretty well useless at the job they're supposed to do. But then the unmonitored 'anarchy' of the citizens DoRed has whipped up is presented as an undesirable opposite extreme (which the show, just this episode, hilariously has a faction of 'pro-safety' citizens rise up in counter-protest to). Once again though the series is asking us to ignore that the issues driving the problems of these darn uppity poors was specifically initiated by a manipulative, agenda-driven government and the corporate elites who financed them, with them being the ones with the most vested interest in keeping the KANAE system still going. The best the show can do is continue to throw around the justification that Mayor Gori 'believes' he's doing the right thing, but that point of the narrative has been tainted pretty much from the word go.    So it might actually be for the best that the ideological components of the plot actually seem to have mostly faded with the show reaching this point. That's why the setup with Asumi's consciousness is even present, really, so that Shu has some sort of consideration apart from having to decide how much police-state surveillance is too much. This does upend the plot in other unintentionally-hilarious ways: Chikuwa dramatically reveals to Shu that the formative school fire wasn't arson at all, but was rather the result of an electrical short. This prompts a minutes-long flashback from Shu where he remembers he actually spotted the wire-chewing rats who likely sparked that, resulting in the traumatic realization that if he had…stopped the rats somehow, none of this might have happened! And yes, it's extremely amusing to imagine that Shu was one Tom & Jerry sketch away from putting this whole exercise on a completely different course, but his reflection on the issue winds up glossing over the point that Mayor Gori, you know, fabricated a crime in order to institute his oppressive public surveillance system.    But as has been the case for Tokyo 24th Ward's storytelling, this emphasis on singular, self-focused choices over any reflection on the societal factors that powers them persists. Shu, Koki, and Ran are brought together again by the end of this one to finally hash out their differences for one las RGB team-up, and it ends up being less of a debate on their particular political ideologies, and more of a violent, circular argument where they all profess how sad and stressed out they are to each other. The one part I can appreciate here is both Ran and Koki directly calling Shu out for his wishy-washy, uninformed centrism, but even that gives way to the supposition that since all of them are hesitating in the face of such a big decision, it must mean they're actually 'the same'.    Their resultant decision to work together feels perfunctory even by this show's standards, specifically with some of the mechanics at hand. Koki's access to the KANAE system and Ran's possession of the Di-VA program that can get them in to have a conversation with Asumi in the Digiverse aren't borne out of the inherent skills they'd previously cultivated in their teamwork, they're just plot devices they got handed before the story shoved them over here (in Ran's case, he gets given the Di-VA drive only minutes before heading to the meeting, like the plot itself suddenly realized it had forgotten to set up such an important component). For an even funnier observation, there's the point that those plot devices, plus the CMD given to Shu so he can activate the Endingtron 3000, were all previously held by the trio of adult characters who were instrumental to this current systemic setup. It means that the grown-ups in this story in fact had the components needed to solve this problem themselves, and didn't, instead simply passing things down to the younger generation to take care of it for them. You can almost see the thematic implication the story is going for there, except in this case it makes no sense for the actual plot at hand. It leaves the exercise with that wholly mechanical feeling of picking up items and recollecting the player characters for the final stretch of a video game, except if I was actually playing it, then at least I might be able to pick out some more amusing dialogue options to keep myself entertained.

News The Prince of Tennis II: U-17 World Cup Anime Casts Tomokazu Seki as Entire Greek Team   posted on 2022-04-01 20:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Seki voices all 7 Hellenic Republic members in 1st TV anime in 10 years    The official website for the Shin Tennis no Ōji-sama U-17 World Cup (The Prince of Tennis II: U-17 World Cup) anime series announced that Tomokazu Seki is voicing every member of the Greek team. The anime's Twitter account acknowledges that the surprising news sounds like an April Fool's joke, but insists that it is real.         The seven Hellenic Republic team members Seki is voicing are:    Zeus Iliopoulos (as previously announced)   Thalatta Hercules    Papadopoulos Evangelos    Vulcan Laërtius    Hermes Kounellis    Orion Stephanopoulos    Aporon (Apollon) Stephanopoulos      The anime will be the first anime in the franchise in about a decade.    The new series features the returning cast members:     Junko Minagawa as Ryōma Echizen   Ryotaro Okiayu as Kunimitsu Tezuka   Hiroki Yasumoto as Hōō Byōdōin   Junichi Suwabe as Keigo Atobe   Sachiko Nagai as Seiichi Yukimura   Yoshimasa Hosoya as Kuranosuke Shiraishi  Tarusuke Shingaki as Eishirō Kite   Mamoru Miyano as Ryōga Echizen    New cast members include:     Hiroki Takahashi as Ralph Rhinehart   Kenjiro Tsuda as Dodo Obando   Takayuki Kondō as Kiko Balentien   Naru Kawamoto as Alan Hopkins   Masaya Onosaka as Rocky Meredith   Kohei Kiyasu as Maxwell   Kentarō Tone as Jürgen Borisovich Volk   Tomokazu Seki as Zeus Iliopoulos   Subaru Kimura as J. J. Dorgias   Kazuyuki Okitsu as Alexander Amadeus   Natsuki Hanae as Prince Ludovic Chardard    Keiichiro Kawaguchi (ISLAND) is returning from the last 2D anime, The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future, to direct the new series at Studio KAI and M.S.C, and Mitsutaka Hirota (Anime-Gataris, Nanbaka) is again superivising the scripts. Akiharu Ishii (Blood+, Ultramarine Magmell) is back to design the characters and serve as chief animation director.    Singer Yoshiki Ezaki and hip-hop duo Bleecker Chrome are collaborating for the anime's opening theme song ""I can fly."" TeniPri Artistars will perform the ending theme song ""Dear Friends.""    The new anime will premiere on TV Tokyo in July.    Takeshi Konomi serialized The Prince of Tennis manga's original run in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1999 to 2008. The manga follows middle school tennis player Ryōma Echizen as he battles rivals to reach the national tournament. That original manga inspired a 2001-2005 television anime, two anime feature films and a theatrical short, various video anime projects, a live-action film, a live-action television series in China, and a popular stage musical series.    Konomi then launched The Prince of Tennis II manga series in Shueisha's Jump SQ. magazine in 2009. The story picks up after the national tournament, when Ryōma joins a select group of middle school players at Japan's top training camp for players under 17. This ongoing sequel manga spawned its own 2012 television anime series The Prince of Tennis II. The Prince of Tennis II OVA vs. Genius 10 series then ran for five volumes from October 2014 to June 2015.    The manga also inspired the Tennis no Ōjisama BEST GAMES!! original video anime (OVA) project that retells the story of the franchise's top matches. The project includes three OVAs that released in 2018-2019. The anime franchise also includes the two-part The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future anime project that debuted on February 13 and April 17.    Most recently, the Ryōma! Shinsei Gekijōban Tennis no Ōji-sama (Ryōma! Rebirth Movie The Prince of Tennis) 3DCG film for The Prince of Tennis franchise opened on September 3.      Update: Anime's website link fixed.

News The Prince of Tennis II: U-17 World Cup Anime Casts Tomokazu Seki as Entire Greek Team   posted on 2022-04-01 20:06 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Seki voices all 7 Hellenic Republic members in 1st TV anime in 10 years    The official website for the Shin Tennis no Ōji-sama U-17 World Cup (The Prince of Tennis II: U-17 World Cup) anime series announced that Tomokazu Seki is voicing every member of the Greek team. The anime's Twitter account acknowledges that the surprising news sounds like an April Fool's joke, but insists that it is real.         The seven Hellenic Republic team members Seki is voicing are:    Zeus Iliopoulos (as previously announced)   Thalatta Hercules    Papadopoulos Evangelos    Vulcan Laërtius    Hermes Kounellis    Orion Stephanopoulos    Aporon (Apollon) Stephanopoulos      The anime will be the first anime in the franchise in about a decade.    The new series features the returning cast members:     Junko Minagawa as Ryōma Echizen   Ryotaro Okiayu as Kunimitsu Tezuka   Hiroki Yasumoto as Hōō Byōdōin   Junichi Suwabe as Keigo Atobe   Sachiko Nagai as Seiichi Yukimura   Yoshimasa Hosoya as Kuranosuke Shiraishi  Tarusuke Shingaki as Eishirō Kite   Mamoru Miyano as Ryōga Echizen    New cast members include:     Hiroki Takahashi as Ralph Rhinehart   Kenjiro Tsuda as Dodo Obando   Takayuki Kondō as Kiko Balentien   Naru Kawamoto as Alan Hopkins   Masaya Onosaka as Rocky Meredith   Kohei Kiyasu as Maxwell   Kentarō Tone as Jürgen Borisovich Volk   Tomokazu Seki as Zeus Iliopoulos   Subaru Kimura as J. J. Dorgias   Kazuyuki Okitsu as Alexander Amadeus   Natsuki Hanae as Prince Ludovic Chardard    Keiichiro Kawaguchi (ISLAND) is returning from the last 2D anime, The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future, to direct the new series at Studio KAI and M.S.C, and Mitsutaka Hirota (Anime-Gataris, Nanbaka) is again superivising the scripts. Akiharu Ishii (Blood+, Ultramarine Magmell) is back to design the characters and serve as chief animation director.    Singer Yoshiki Ezaki and hip-hop duo Bleecker Chrome are collaborating for the anime's opening theme song ""I can fly."" TeniPri Artistars will perform the ending theme song ""Dear Friends.""    The new anime will premiere on TV Tokyo in July.    Takeshi Konomi serialized The Prince of Tennis manga's original run in Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine from 1999 to 2008. The manga follows middle school tennis player Ryōma Echizen as he battles rivals to reach the national tournament. That original manga inspired a 2001-2005 television anime, two anime feature films and a theatrical short, various video anime projects, a live-action film, a live-action television series in China, and a popular stage musical series.    Konomi then launched The Prince of Tennis II manga series in Shueisha's Jump SQ. magazine in 2009. The story picks up after the national tournament, when Ryōma joins a select group of middle school players at Japan's top training camp for players under 17. This ongoing sequel manga spawned its own 2012 television anime series The Prince of Tennis II. The Prince of Tennis II OVA vs. Genius 10 series then ran for five volumes from October 2014 to June 2015.    The manga also inspired the Tennis no Ōjisama BEST GAMES!! original video anime (OVA) project that retells the story of the franchise's top matches. The project includes three OVAs that released in 2018-2019. The anime franchise also includes the two-part The Prince of Tennis II Hyotei vs Rikkai Game of Future anime project that debuted on February 13 and April 17.    Most recently, the Ryōma! Shinsei Gekijōban Tennis no Ōji-sama (Ryōma! Rebirth Movie The Prince of Tennis) 3DCG film for The Prince of Tennis franchise opened on September 3.      Update: Anime's website link fixed.

News Deaimon Anime's 2nd Full Promo Video Previews Maaya Sakamoto's Opening Song   posted on 2022-03-31 16:28 UTC-8 by Egan Loo          Satsuki Yukino narrates to introduce characters, staff in Kyoto-set story    The official website for the television anime of Rin Asano's Deaimon manga posted the anime's second promotional video on Thursday. The video  previews the anime's opening theme song  ""Sumire"" (Pansy) by Maaya Sakamoto. Satsuki Yukino narrates the video, introducing the characters and the main staff members.       Sakamoto's song will go on sale on May 25.       The anime's website also announced that the Kyoto Fresh Confectionary Cooperative, an organization of 110 confectionary shops, is collaborating with the anime. The shop will be displaying posters using the anime's visuals.     The manga's story centers on Nagomu, a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    The anime stars Nobunaga Shimazaki as Nagomu Irino and Kozue Yūki as Itsuka Yukihira.

BLOOM, Etotama, Isekai Cheat Magician). Reiko Yoshida (K-ON!, Tamako Love Story, Liz and the Blue Bird) is overseeing the series scripts, and Sakae Shibuya (A Centaur's Life, Magical Girl Site) is the character designer and chief animation director.

The video  previews the anime's opening theme song  ""Sumire"" (Pansy) by Maaya Sakamoto. Satsuki Yukino narrates the video, introducing the characters and the main staff members.       Sakamoto's song will go on sale on May 25.       The anime's website also announced that the Kyoto Fresh Confectionary Cooperative, an organization of 110 confectionary shops, is collaborating with the anime. The shop will be displaying posters using the anime's visuals.     The manga's story centers on Nagomu, a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    The anime stars Nobunaga Shimazaki as Nagomu Irino and Kozue Yūki as Itsuka Yukihira.

BLOOM, Etotama, Isekai Cheat Magician). Reiko Yoshida (K-ON!, Tamako Love Story, Liz and the Blue Bird) is overseeing the series scripts, and Sakae Shibuya (A Centaur's Life, Magical Girl Site) is the character designer and chief animation director.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Executioner and Her Way of Life   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Executioner and Her Way of Life ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's. But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.

But worse still is the fact that every summoned kid is basically a walking WMD—and there's not even a “Demon Lord” to pit them against.    So what we have are unstable teens, stolen from their homes, given godlike powers, and feeling like they are the most important people in the world. Is it any surprise that after the first few of them went crazy, a revolution occurred that basically set up a hierarchy where the church was tasked with killing the summoned kids and punishing the people who summoned them?    One thing I love is that the church assassins have learned to play into the fantasy world tropes that the summoned Japanese kids are familiar with. Every assassin we've seen so far as been a woman—a strict teacher, a kindly grandmother, and a precocious little sister. Menou herself plays the pure and kind priestess role perfectly—including just enough of her own personality to make her feel like a real person and not an actor. Each would work as a solid cover for getting close to the summoned kids.    I also love how the episode doesn't waste our time. It didn't give us 22 minutes pretending to be just another isekai power fantasy with a milquetoast protagonist. It only takes 10 minutes for his butt to end up dead on the floor—and that 10 minutes is used to introduce us to the world more than anything else. Honestly, it is great writing that allows the back half of the episode to expound on the twist and layout the complications facing Menou and her order. It also shows us that Menou doesn't see the Japanese as evil nor herself as a hero for killing them. She is doing what she needs to do to protect her world. No more, no less.    After one episode, I'm all in for this series. It seems to be perfectly tailored for me and I can't wait to follow it each week.       James Beckett  Rating:                Even before we hit that moment, I was digging The Executioner and Her Way of Life quite a bit. I'm used to seeing isekai anime with self-aware protagonists, but I really loved getting to see an entire world that has grown used to treating visitors from another world as old hat. It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   The Lost Ones are wanderers who come here from a distant world known as ""Japan."" No one knows how or why they leave their homes. The only thing that is certain is that they bring disaster and calamity. The duty of exterminating them without remorse falls to Menou, a young Executioner. When she meets Akari, it seems like just another job until she discovers it's impossible to kill her. And when Menou begins to search for a way to defeat this immortality, Akari is more than happy to tag along.    The Executioner and Her Way of Life is based on Mato Satō and Nilitsu's light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                To be honest, as someone who has over the years slogged through isekai premiere after isekai premiere, there was a bit of spite to my anticipation for The Executioner and Her Way of Life. I pictured Menou hunting down bland Kirito clone after bland Kirito clone, ruthlessly taking them out so that their narcissistic, overpowered tomfoolery didn't upset the balance of her world. I assumed it would be a brutal action series that flew in defiance and gave voice to the frustrations of those of us who cry out, “For the love of God, please make an anime about something else!”    That's not what The Executioner and Her Way of Life is at all. The defining emotion behind the production isn't cruelty or spite, but melancholy—a very real sadness as Menou swiftly and efficiently eliminates the teenage boy she had just lured to her church. He didn't ask for this, and even though his potential to become an existential threat to her world once he fully developed his powers was clear, he was more a victim of circumstance than anything else.    What really makes the episode work is its incredible sense of balance, never pushing too far in one direction or another. The time Menou spends with poor Potato-kun before dispatching him is just enough to feel like they're building a rapport and introduce the world, but doesn't go long enough to feel like they're faffing about. The on-screen deaths are swift and matter-of-fact instead of leaning into gratuitous, bloody spectacle, but also just graphic enough that they aren't shying away either. There's comic relief but never at an inappropriate time (although I would prefer that Momo wasn't like that), so the emotional ups and downs of the episode flow smoothly from one to the next.    No, The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't what I expected at all. But I like what we got way more.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The Executioner and Her Way of Life isn't the first anime to take the tropes of its genre, deconstruct them, and play them straight. For magical girls, we had Madoka Magica. For giant robots, Gurren Lagann. Heck, in the isekai fantasy genre, we've already had several—e.g., Re:Zero, Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash, and The Rising of The Shield Hero. What sets The Executioner and Her Way of Life apart from its isekai peers is that the viewpoint character isn't the fish out of water from Japan but rather one of the people whose world is being invaded.    This is a world where random Japanese high schoolers have been summoned dozens if not hundreds of times. Each one of them has styled themselves as some kind of “fantasy story protagonist” and set out to effect the world. Some of these changes have been good—like an increase in overall technology. Others... not so much. The world's original culture and language have been largely supplanted by Japan's.

It was funny watching Mitsuki get tossed out on his ass and basically ignored, and I appreciated how Menou's world runs with the concept of a cliché isekai setting that has actually incorporated Japanese culture and technology into its own. The show was well-animated and confidently directed, and so for the first half of its premiere, I was expecting Executioner to be in the same territory as Re:Zero, where it would operate within the realm of fairly predictable isekai tropes, albeit with a level of polish and creativity that would entertain even an old crank like me. Really, the only concern I had was Mitsuki himself, who was a real nothingburger of a protagonist, and easily the least likeable aspect of the episode.    Then Menou shoved her blade right into Mitsuki's skull, and I realized that The Executioner and Her Way of Life might actually kind of rule. It isn't just because seeing Mitsuki bite it was a cathartic release of the pent-up rage I've built for every lame isekai potato-boy that we've seen over the years, either. It was that flash of cruel callousness that Mitsuki exhibited right before he bit the dust that really got me tuned into this show's wavelength. Executioner doesn't just recognize the inherently problematic aspects of having a bunch of angsty teens from another universe fall out of the sky with almost godlike powers at their disposal; it builds that tension right into Menou's tragic origin. As it turns out, most kids in the position of an isekai protagonist would probably be scared and confused, and they might end up doing things like accidentally turning a village of innocent civilians into terrifying salt monsters in a desperate attempt to return home. That's more than just a creative spin on well-worn genre cliches. That's solid storytelling, straight up.    I'll admit that the scattershot tone of the premiere's second half didn't wow me as much as what came before it. Momo's relationship with Menou is cute, but the “hypersexual lesbian comic relief” bit feels like a cliché that's being played straight, which is disappointing, and the shift to overly comedic banter felt at odds with the very dark and exciting elements of the first part of the episode. Still, Menou is a very cool character to be following in a story like this, and the “other” Lost One that got summoned in by the sketchy royals looks to be an interesting “heroine” in her own right. Time will tell if The Executioner and Her Way of Life turns out to be the absolute barnburner that it could grow into, but it's got my attention at the very least, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                I don't have the words to express just how big a gulp of fresh air this premiere was. Every season we get what feels like a half-dozen versions of the same show. Some Melvin gets tossed into a fantasy world that oh-so-conveniently works just like his favorite video game, develops Übermensch fantasy powers that make all the pretty girls want to date and/or be enslaved by him, and we have to pretend we haven't seen that exact premise 40 times in the past year. So to have a show with an honest-to-god clever take on the standard isekai setup – not a wacky gimmick to stick on the front cover, but an actually interesting idea that runs deeper than a kiddie pool – and one that takes place in an instantly fascinating and fleshed-out fantasy world? It feels like a minor miracle.    Really, everything about this premiere is just damn good anime storytelling. From the moment Menou reaches out to our nameless isekai potatoman there's a sense that she's not quite the innocent maiden offering to help him out of the goodness of her heart she presents herself as. But even before the ruse is up, she expresses a ton of personality: sarcasm, humor, and just stuff you want to see in a character that so rarely gets highlighted with the female leads of isekai story. And the premiere wisely doesn't wait its whole runtime to reveal its hand, with Menou executing her charge with brutal efficiency the moment he unlocks his OP special ability, less than halfway into the episode. By not stretching out that bait and switch, we get to actually see Menou in her element, learn about who she is and why she works as an otherworld executioner for the church, as well as a ridiculously compelling glimpse into the world around her.    That part is especially important for me. This is a world that, while having some similarities to other standard isekai fantasy settings, feels like it has a history to it. This is a world with an established caste structure that is nonetheless in contention between the church and the nobles. This is a place that has been summoning randos from Japan for so long that their influences have greatly shaped the culture of the people living there. This is a place with really cool and clever fantasy devices, like our executioners' Scripture books that allow them to communicate and cast spells with vastly different effects. It's just a cool, interesting world that you want to spend time in and learn more about, and it's such a rarity in the current isekai zeitgeist.    And while its riffing on isekai tropes could have felt like inside baseball, so far it's been a pretty thoughtful – if critical – look at the very conceit rather than just self-aware references. It's certainly not the first series to posit that giving insecure teenagers god-tier powers is a bad idea, but the show zeroes in on the cruel tragedy of it all instead of going for edgy shock value. The scene of the Lost One who unintentionally killed Menou's whole village by turning them into pillars of salt is effective both in its horror and its function to show that these people Menou and her compatriots are sent to kill are dangerous, but not inherently evil. They're people in way over their heads and even if Menou feels killing them is the right thing to do, she recognizes they didn't deserve that fate. That's a really compelling conflict for both the story and Menou's character, and I'm really interested to see it play out with her next target. Though if I were here I'd have murdered the first guy the moment he talked about introducing mayonnaise to her world. That's the real danger worth snuffing out.    In all this is the best kind of premiere you can ask for. It's exciting, compelling, excellently animated, and gives you every reason to come back for more. If you're understandably wary of yet another isekai fantasy story trying to be dark and edgy, put those worries to the side, because this one is absolutely a keeper.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This show has a good premise, although not entirely unique, and I think I prefer the way it was done in Kazamidori's Goodbye Otherworld, See You Tomorrow, which teems with melancholy and is a bit less on the nose than The Executioner and Her Way of Life. Both stories take the idea that all of those pesky Japanese teens who keep getting summoned to their fantasy worlds are causing more (or at least just as much) harm than good, where the world has undergone an apocalyptic event by the time our hero is summoned, and in the latter the object is to prevent another apocalyptic scenario by killing Lost Ones, as the isekai victims are known. That opens the door for our eponymous executioner, and I must say that her introduction is nicely handled. The misdirection that we're just getting another everyday isekai story about a bullied teenage boy summoned to another world is well done, and when Menou pulls out her knife and stabs it into his skull, it comes out of nowhere.    Or does it? There are some good details leading up to the reveal that work in the first half of the episode's favor, such as the way Japanese culture is slowly taking over the indigenous culture of the fantasy world and that Mitsuki's first thoughts upon realizing that he's got the power to “nullify” (as in erase from existence) are that now no one can mistreat him because he'll destroy them before they ever get the chance. It's an abrupt shift for him from being fully dependent on Menou and a little bit of a sad sack, but given that his first words in the new world are that no one can ever pick on him again, they're not completely out of the blue. It definitely feels like a statement on the kind of character we typically see in isekai power fantasies, and while murder is objectively bad, it's also not hard to see why Menou and the members of her church kill the Lost Ones and reprimand those who summon them.    The first half is much stronger than the second, largely because it doesn't involve Momo, our requisite predatory lesbian. Momo's obsession with Menou (and her grope-fest) sucks all of the tension and interest right out of the plot, and while the story tries to recover from her ill-advised entry on the scene, it's a struggle. The potential that Menou and the other Lost One summoned with Mitsuki, a girl who's being kept in the castle he was thrown out of, could have a romantic or other link based on mutual dreams of each other across the worlds is a definite mark in the show's favor, but the way that Momo's handled makes me worried that the storytelling won't be up to the task. It may be worth another episode to see how that plotline develops (and how much Momo's going to be in the story), but while this is fine, I think the other book does it better.  ",positive,en,{}

Does a great job being sexy (surprised there weren't many comments on the sexiness factor since it's an ecchi series). Likable characters too, and a great ending.      Back to top                  dm   Subscriber   Joined: 24 Sep 2010 		    Posts: 952       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 1:15 pm            I pretty much agree with the review.  Viewed uncharitably, the manga starts with a date-rape (the landlord takes advantage of Chiyo's drunken stupor to seduce her), and if she were male it would be unforgivable. I guess I have a bit of a double standard, there.   As the manga goes on, one comes to feel that there's trauma in the landlord's past and I found myself wanting to learn more about her.  Indeed, as the manga goes on, I started to doubt that much happened that first night --- or at least the landlord wishes that were the case --- even though the landlord teases Chiyo about her responses from time to time.   Yes, it walks a delicate line, but so far it succeeds in that for me.

Does a great job being sexy (surprised there weren't many comments on the sexiness factor since it's an ecchi series). Likable characters too, and a great ending.      Back to top                  dm   Subscriber   Joined: 24 Sep 2010 		    Posts: 952       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 1:15 pm            I pretty much agree with the review.  Viewed uncharitably, the manga starts with a date-rape (the landlord takes advantage of Chiyo's drunken stupor to seduce her), and if she were male it would be unforgivable. I guess I have a bit of a double standard, there.   As the manga goes on, one comes to feel that there's trauma in the landlord's past and I found myself wanting to learn more about her.  Indeed, as the manga goes on, I started to doubt that much happened that first night --- or at least the landlord wishes that were the case --- even though the landlord teases Chiyo about her responses from time to time.   Yes, it walks a delicate line, but so far it succeeds in that for me.
