Interest Masamune-kun's Revenge Anime Jokingly Announces ""Season 3"" For April Fool's   posted on 2022-04-01 12:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Even though there isn't even a season 2 yet...    The Masamune-kun's Revenge anime released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3."" In the illustration, Yoshino Koiwai is shown reaching for a sign reading ""Season 3 production confirmed,"" while Aki Adagaki points out: ""What are you doing? Before you can announce season 3, you have to announce season 2! Take that down!""     The image hints at a possible season 2, given that there is a second sign underneath the ""season 3"" one.    Hazuki Takeoka and Tiv's Masamune-kun's Revenge (Masamune-kun no Revenge) manga inspired a television anime adaptation that premiered in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    The manga launched the series in Ichijinsha's Monthly Comic Rex magazine in 2012, and ended in June 2018. An original anime disc (OAD) that Ichijinsha bundled with the manga's 10th volume also tells an ""after story"" for the manga. The volume shipped in July 2018.

Interest Masamune-kun's Revenge Anime Jokingly Announces ""Season 3"" For April Fool's   posted on 2022-04-01 12:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Even though there isn't even a season 2 yet...    The Masamune-kun's Revenge anime released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3."" In the illustration, Yoshino Koiwai is shown reaching for a sign reading ""Season 3 production confirmed,"" while Aki Adagaki points out: ""What are you doing? Before you can announce season 3, you have to announce season 2! Take that down!""     The image hints at a possible season 2, given that there is a second sign underneath the ""season 3"" one.    Hazuki Takeoka and Tiv's Masamune-kun's Revenge (Masamune-kun no Revenge) manga inspired a television anime adaptation that premiered in January 2017. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Funimation streamed an English dub.    The manga launched the series in Ichijinsha's Monthly Comic Rex magazine in 2012, and ended in June 2018. An original anime disc (OAD) that Ichijinsha bundled with the manga's 10th volume also tells an ""after story"" for the manga. The volume shipped in July 2018.

The Masamune-kun's Revenge anime released an April Fool's comic strip on Friday jokingly announcing a ""season 3."" In the illustration, Yoshino Koiwai is shown reaching for a sign reading ""Season 3 production confirmed,"" while Aki Adagaki points out: ""What are you doing?

News SPYAIR Vocalist IKE Leaves Band Due to Ulcerative Colitis   posted on 2022-03-31 22:09 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Concerts from May-July have been canceled    Rock band SPYAIR's vocalist IKE announced on Thursday that he has left the band due to his ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. IKE was first diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in summer 2019 and was hospitalized. He then reached a remission period. However, following a re-examination in January, he found out that the disease has relapsed. He is almost finished with treatment, but he has not reached remission. After discussions with the other members, IKE decided that as it was difficult for him to continue musical activities, he would withdraw from the band.    The other three members UZ, MOMIKEN, and KENTA will remain with the band. Their AIR-GATE LIVE 2022 and JUST LIKE THIS 2022 concerts from May to July have been canceled. There will be refunds.    SPYAIR performed theme songs for Gintama, Haikyu!!, Bleach, Samurai Flamenco, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans.

News SPYAIR Vocalist IKE Leaves Band Due to Ulcerative Colitis   posted on 2022-03-31 22:09 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Concerts from May-July have been canceled    Rock band SPYAIR's vocalist IKE announced on Thursday that he has left the band due to his ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. IKE was first diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in summer 2019 and was hospitalized. He then reached a remission period. However, following a re-examination in January, he found out that the disease has relapsed. He is almost finished with treatment, but he has not reached remission. After discussions with the other members, IKE decided that as it was difficult for him to continue musical activities, he would withdraw from the band.    The other three members UZ, MOMIKEN, and KENTA will remain with the band. Their AIR-GATE LIVE 2022 and JUST LIKE THIS 2022 concerts from May to July have been canceled. There will be refunds.    SPYAIR performed theme songs for Gintama, Haikyu!!, Bleach, Samurai Flamenco, and Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans.

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.6            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.6            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.6            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

Akebi's Sailor Uniform Episode 12  by Mercedez Clewis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.6            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.

02-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/akebi-sailor-uniform/episode-12/.184138,Episode 12 - Akebi's Sailor Uniform - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 12 of Akebi's Sailor Uniform ?                     Community score: 4.6            “I'm Not Alone” is such an apt title for Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale that I found myself tearing up before I even hit play. That said, hitting play drops us into the dog days of Japanese summer post-rainy season, and more importantly, the school sports festival.    Hardcut to Komichi's performance on the grand stage as part of the cheer squad. Yet, she's alone. She's terrified, frozen in place, unable to move. Komichi even remarks that it feels like she's underwater, a feeling I can relate to as someone perpetually trapped at the precipice of what feels like a heart attack but is actually anxiety, coursing through my veins like a raging river. Anxiety like that is isolating. It's like being in the bathyal zone of the ocean, 3,300 feet below a churning crush of emotions, barely able to see a way through.    Then Erika comes on stage and starts playing the piano, turning Akebi's Sailor Uniform into my everything for Winter 2022.    You already know. Cue the tears and open mouthed, gasping sobs as we go back through all of these lovely, key moments over the past few days that inspire Akebi. Moments spent with her classmates, watching them practice, watching them grow, observing their own SMALL WORLDS. It's this really beautiful, extended scene that brings together days and weeks and months and seasons of Komichi cheerfully engaging with school life and growing up.    And it's beautiful. It's really, really beautiful. Erika switches to violin, and the music swells with this rich, warm series of chords as Komichi dances her heart out in one of the most memorable sequences, and I gently laid myself on the ground to weep because gosh darn it, there is something so nice about a show centered on young female happiness. Something so utterly breathtaking that I long for those halcyon days when I made my own joy and didn't care about anyone's opinion in it but my own, when I swept up all my friends in laughing and screaming and being utterly cringe in public.    I find it striking that Akebi's Sailor Uniform's finale is largely a series on montages. There's voiced lines, but they're sparse, opening the show up to the diegetic soundtrack and sound design for the bulk of the episode. In fact, it's only in the last five minutes that things shift back to a “normal” episode, and even then, the conversations are few and far between, leaving space for one last moment with Komichi as she gets ready for school. We see her off, her sailor uniform just so, before she dashes off to school. It's a proper way to end things, coming full circle on one girl's tender beginnings in middle school, and all the beautiful memories she's made.    Episode 12 feels like a celebration of three months with the world's most charming middle schooler. The real sailor uniform was the friends we made along the way. Sure, Akebi's had its foibles and uncomfortable moments. I don't think you can really divorce those from the show (or the source content) and really engage with it. Keeping that in mind, I think there's a lot of meat on the bone here: Akebi's Sailor Uniform is really, really good slice of life fare, and quickly became my favorite show of this season.    As the credits rolled with a brand new verse in the OP (Hajimari no Setsuna, or The First Moment), I found it hard to breath as I silently sobbed over my mechanical keyboard because, damn, I love it when anime ends like this, especially when it's full of young women just existing. While Akebi's Sailor Uniform is definitely a Seinen (proof: anytime the camera does what the camera does), I found so much joy in reading this series as a coming-of-age story about a teenager just being passionate. A part of me hopes that in the source, Komichi never loses her passion, that she's just this ray of sunshine who never gives up and inspires others to be exactly who they are. I can certainly say that that's exactly what Komichi has inspired me to do with my own small world. Hopefully, she inspires you as well.
