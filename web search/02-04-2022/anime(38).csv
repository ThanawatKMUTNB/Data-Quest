Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.  Rating:                 Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.

Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 Episode 86  by James Beckett, Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 86 of Attack on Titan The Final Season Part 2 ?                     Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.   At the very least, “Retrospective” features some of the goriest and impressively choreographed action that The Final Season has ever delivered, and every character gets a moment to shine. Conny gets to wreak enough havoc alone that it reminds you of why he graduated in the top ranks of the trainees to begin with, and Hange joins in the fracas as well. Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home.

Mikasa's showstopping set piece is so over-the-top bloody that it's almost funny, and feels tailor made to serve as a highlight for the innumerable fist-pumping hard-rock AMVs that the fandom will be pumping out for years to come. Falco has an awesome turn as the new Jaw Titan (which I have affectionately dubbed “Chicken Boo”), but our girl Gabi steals the show with yet another one-in-a-million no-scope that shoots Floch right out of the goddamned sky. I doubt the bastard is dead, but I will feel so vindicated if Gabi was the one to finally squash that bug for good.  ”Restrospective” isn't all mindless spectacle, either. Attack on Titan is classy enough to remember that all of this murder and killing isn't actually a good thing, and we get some very powerful character beats to send that message home. Shadis and Magath's last stand is the standout scene of the episode, and it makes perfect sense that these two old dogs would meet for the first time in the final moments of their life. This kind of heroic sacrifice is par for the course when it comes to war stories like AoT, but the old men's final words drive home the themes that the show has been working so hard to cultivate. The suffering and exploitation of children has been at the forefront of Attack on Titan's concerns since Episode 1, and Magath takes one last opportunity to express regret not just for his own bigotry, but for how he drove innocent children into fighting the same hateful wars on his nation's behalf.  Annie mirrors the same sentiment that Shadis and Magath do, right before they blow the hell out of the Jeagerist compound. There has been so much suffering, so much loss, so much needless destruction, and the only way to make any of it worth it would be to ensure that they find a way to stop the war for good. According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.

Community score: 4.3              “I've been looking for a good time to die.”  “Retrospective” is one of those Attack on Titan episodes that wrestles with the same fundamental paradox that has stymied so many of the war stories that came before it: Is it possible to do justice the horror and tragedy of war if you're also indulging in the bloody spectacle of it all? It's not the first time that AoT has walked the line between grim parable and bombastic entertainment, but this might be the most glaring instance of the show fighting to have its cake and eat it too. For weeks now, we've been watching the human survivors on Paradis come to grips with their own guilt and culpability, and “Traitor” went so far as to devote a full half-hour to drawing out the terrible suspense that Armin and the others felt as it became more and more certain that they'd have to betray and kill their former friends to save the world.  At the same time, Attack on Titan is the anime where soldiers zip around on rocket-powered grappling hooks so they can dual-wield their swords and slice up giant monsters, never mind that they sometimes become those monsters in order to stir up some positively badass giant fights. Sure, at this moment, the tension is high and the line between friend and foe has become hopelessly blurry, but no matter how awful and stomach-churning things get on the battlefield, there's still that ancient, reptilian corner of our brain that isn't ashamed to hoot and holler with approval when our heroes get some real good killing done.  It's like Jean reminds himself as the carnage begins to explode all around him: If they stop to hesitate for even a second, Eren and his Colossal Titans will ruin the world. It's one of those points where the adrenalin rush of combat is allowed to overtake the more sane and reasonable parts of the human brain, and you're allowed to get just a little bit excited about the insanely cool shit that these soldiers are able to accomplish in times of extreme danger. MAPPA's production has been understandably shaky recently, but they pulled out the big guns for this one. It has always been dubiously ethical to revel in all of the bloodshed while still going along with the anime's stridently anti-war perspective for all these years, and that is unlikely to change so long as we have stories about war that strive to entertain its audience while imparting some kind of moral lesson.

According to Hange, Liberio and Marley are doomed no matter what they do, and while Annie nearly gives up in her grief, she understands that fighting for the future is the only option they have left. It's what Magath and Shadis died for. In all likelihood, it's what Eren will have to die for, too.  Armin and Mikasa aren't able to respond when Annie asks if killing Eren is something that they can live with, but they will have to make their decision soon. With only one more episode (and the inevitable final film/mini-series) to go, our heroes no longer have the luxury of indecision. There's no more time left to waste. The end is here.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be.

Re:Dive Season 2 - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Princess Connect! Re:Dive Season 2 Episode 12  by Richard Eisenbeis, Mar 30th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Princess Connect! Re:Dive (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.5           This, the final episode of Princess Connect! Re:Dive, is a roller coaster. It's fast-paced, flashy, and hits all the emotional ups and downs you'd expect. It's easy to get caught up in cheering for our heroes in their final battle and feel satisfied at the happy end they've earned.    Pecorine saves the people of Landsol, reunites with her family, and even manages to do it without killing anyone. Kayrl, on the other hand, is able to stand with her new friends, establish the personal connection with Kaiser she's always wanted, and save Kaiser's life—even if that means Kaiser will be imprisoned indefinitely. Lastly, Yuuki is able to do what he wasn't able to do in the previous loop—put it all on the line for his friends and come out victorious. These are all good, solid endings to our heroes and their character arcs—and we even get a ton of extra fanservice as every character we've met so far shows up either in the climax or gets a little epilogue still-frame (or both).    Unfortunately, this episode comes with one major problem—one that has plagued the series as a whole on one level or another: It only really works beyond a surface level if you've played the game. For anime-only viewers, it's got to feel like you're missing major swaths of the story even as the main credits roll. You know that there is some sort of bigger tale going on with Kaiser, Labyrista, and Neneka but nothing about the specifics.    This hurts the anime in a massive way—especially as the series never truly dives into the main villain's motivations. Oh sure, we are told Kaiser is tired from having lived the looping world so many times—and that she hopes to make a utopia. But what does this mean exactly? What is a utopia for Kaiser? Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle.

Who is the “Minerva” she prays to and what part would Minerva play in all this? And what does pulling Sol Tower down have to do with anything? Heck, beyond the last reset (which was done for Yuuki's sake) we don't even know why loops occur in the first place!    Of course, mentioning important things in passing while never explaining them is hardly new for the show. What are the “Seven Crowns”? What does it mean to be a “Princess Knight”? How/why did Yuuki become Labyrista's? These are important questions and not knowing the answers leaves more than a few holes in this episode's climax.    Overall, the series has tried to make a show that works for both Princess Connect newbies and players of the game—and on some level it has. The emotional character arcs for the Gourmet Guild are well-build and well-defined. We've come to know their goals, motivations, and backstories—and it's easy to root for them. However, the lack of a clear explanation for the setting and the villain's motivations leaves the show with a giant hole in the middle. Though, given that this anime exists largely to get people to play the game, maybe that's the point: “Confused? I guess you'll just have to download the game then, won't you?”    Rating:                Random Thoughts:   •	We never did find out what the shadow did and what the real kaiser did in the story overall. Oh well!    •	Looking back, it's odd but Kokkoro didn't really get an arc. She was more just the kind, loving, straight-man.    •	I don't know why Little Lyrical of all possible guilds got so much of the spotlight in these final three episodes but the payoff of them getting to do a classic GINAX Pose was well worth it.    •	I loved the effect of Jun's platemail rippling like liquid from Kaiser's attack.    •	If you didn't know that Jun was voiced by Ayako Kawasumi, having her do the classic Fate Stay/night Saber pose probably spelled it out for you.    •	I am shocked that Twinkle Wish did not appear—implying they are well and truly dead. I did not expect that. Knowing that they are dead and not coming back makes Yuuki's depression a few episodes back far more powerful. Unfortunately, at the time, the thought of the original game's three main characters actually being dead was so unbelievable that I rejected the concept outright and all the drama was lost.    •	All in all, this season was much better than I expected it would be. I had a lot of fun writing these reviews and I hope you enjoyed reading them just as much.       Princess Connect! Re:Dive is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

There are a bunch of ps1/ps2 games that I'd love to replay (and a few psp), and if the service allows for them, I'd be happy to fork over the cash. Play through some of the old, niche rpgs again- Something like, say, Shadow Hearts, Growlanser, or Arc the Lad? Don't mind if I do.

I can't see the new PS+ options being any good outside of Premium and even then, it's overpriced; at least Japan got a bit of a deal but not by much and they'll have a far better games library.

The problem with E3 has been that it seemed to be an in awkward halfway state between serious trade show and convention. So you would have these investor showings but then loads of typical gamer stuff. Either be GDC or be PAX, you can't do both. And it's only gotten worse after Nintendo switched from pressers to Directs at E3 and caused the entire industry to switch to that (even if most of them clearly don't get what makes Directs appealing). So here we are, wondering if E3 is going to continue existing, let alone what path it should take    (PS. Keighley sucks, is a mousey shill, and will never get a Zelda reveal no matter how much he begs Nintendo.)   -BOTW2: As usual, Nintendo would rather announce a delay than release something unfinished. And considering how the rest of the year is pretty stacked with Fire Emblem: Three Hopes, Splatoon 3, Live A Live, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Bayonetta 3, and Xenoblade 3, BOTW 2 out next year is not a huge deal. And no, people are not getting a new Switch, Nintendo's making so much money they're in no hurry (AND THE CHIP SHORTAGE IS STILL A THING!)   -PS+: It shows how borked the PS3 is that they can't actually emulate its games, resorting to the cloud instead.

There are a bunch of ps1/ps2 games that I'd love to replay (and a few psp), and if the service allows for them, I'd be happy to fork over the cash. Play through some of the old, niche rpgs again- Something like, say, Shadow Hearts, Growlanser, or Arc the Lad? Don't mind if I do.

I can't see the new PS+ options being any good outside of Premium and even then, it's overpriced; at least Japan got a bit of a deal but not by much and they'll have a far better games library.

The problem with E3 has been that it seemed to be an in awkward halfway state between serious trade show and convention. So you would have these investor showings but then loads of typical gamer stuff. Either be GDC or be PAX, you can't do both. And it's only gotten worse after Nintendo switched from pressers to Directs at E3 and caused the entire industry to switch to that (even if most of them clearly don't get what makes Directs appealing). So here we are, wondering if E3 is going to continue existing, let alone what path it should take    (PS. Keighley sucks, is a mousey shill, and will never get a Zelda reveal no matter how much he begs Nintendo.)   -BOTW2: As usual, Nintendo would rather announce a delay than release something unfinished. And considering how the rest of the year is pretty stacked with Fire Emblem: Three Hopes, Splatoon 3, Live A Live, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Bayonetta 3, and Xenoblade 3, BOTW 2 out next year is not a huge deal. And no, people are not getting a new Switch, Nintendo's making so much money they're in no hurry (AND THE CHIP SHORTAGE IS STILL A THING!)   -PS+: It shows how borked the PS3 is that they can't actually emulate its games, resorting to the cloud instead.

There are a bunch of ps1/ps2 games that I'd love to replay (and a few psp), and if the service allows for them, I'd be happy to fork over the cash. Play through some of the old, niche rpgs again- Something like, say, Shadow Hearts, Growlanser, or Arc the Lad? Don't mind if I do.

I can't see the new PS+ options being any good outside of Premium and even then, it's overpriced; at least Japan got a bit of a deal but not by much and they'll have a far better games library.

The problem with E3 has been that it seemed to be an in awkward halfway state between serious trade show and convention. So you would have these investor showings but then loads of typical gamer stuff. Either be GDC or be PAX, you can't do both. And it's only gotten worse after Nintendo switched from pressers to Directs at E3 and caused the entire industry to switch to that (even if most of them clearly don't get what makes Directs appealing). So here we are, wondering if E3 is going to continue existing, let alone what path it should take    (PS. Keighley sucks, is a mousey shill, and will never get a Zelda reveal no matter how much he begs Nintendo.)   -BOTW2: As usual, Nintendo would rather announce a delay than release something unfinished. And considering how the rest of the year is pretty stacked with Fire Emblem: Three Hopes, Splatoon 3, Live A Live, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Bayonetta 3, and Xenoblade 3, BOTW 2 out next year is not a huge deal. And no, people are not getting a new Switch, Nintendo's making so much money they're in no hurry (AND THE CHIP SHORTAGE IS STILL A THING!)   -PS+: It shows how borked the PS3 is that they can't actually emulate its games, resorting to the cloud instead.

There are a bunch of ps1/ps2 games that I'd love to replay (and a few psp), and if the service allows for them, I'd be happy to fork over the cash. Play through some of the old, niche rpgs again- Something like, say, Shadow Hearts, Growlanser, or Arc the Lad? Don't mind if I do.

I can't see the new PS+ options being any good outside of Premium and even then, it's overpriced; at least Japan got a bit of a deal but not by much and they'll have a far better games library.

The problem with E3 has been that it seemed to be an in awkward halfway state between serious trade show and convention. So you would have these investor showings but then loads of typical gamer stuff. Either be GDC or be PAX, you can't do both. And it's only gotten worse after Nintendo switched from pressers to Directs at E3 and caused the entire industry to switch to that (even if most of them clearly don't get what makes Directs appealing). So here we are, wondering if E3 is going to continue existing, let alone what path it should take    (PS. Keighley sucks, is a mousey shill, and will never get a Zelda reveal no matter how much he begs Nintendo.)   -BOTW2: As usual, Nintendo would rather announce a delay than release something unfinished. And considering how the rest of the year is pretty stacked with Fire Emblem: Three Hopes, Splatoon 3, Live A Live, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, Bayonetta 3, and Xenoblade 3, BOTW 2 out next year is not a huge deal. And no, people are not getting a new Switch, Nintendo's making so much money they're in no hurry (AND THE CHIP SHORTAGE IS STILL A THING!)   -PS+: It shows how borked the PS3 is that they can't actually emulate its games, resorting to the cloud instead.

News New Jersey's AnimeNEXT Cancels 2022 Event Due to Issues with Convention Center   posted on 2022-03-31 00:17 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Center is raising prices, does not require masks, has not communicated properly with convention staff    The staff of New Jersey-based anime convention AnimeNEXT announced on Wednesday that it is calling off all public-facing attractions of AnimeNEXT 2022, which includes the in-person convention. The staff is canceling the event because of issues with the Atlantic City Convention Center, which the convention had been using since 2016.    The staff stated that the convention center is raising all prices that the event pays by 40-70% because AnimeNEXT has not occurred at the center in two years, the center does not require masks so AnimeNEXT cannot enforce policies regarding the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the nearby Orange Loop Rock Festival event is also occurring during the same weekend, and the center did not inform AnimeNEXT staff of the festival or of other necessary items.    Due to the contractual obligations, the convention staff still required to hold an ""event"" within the convention center or they would trigger multiple cancellation clauses. The staff is holding staff-only workshops and team-building exercises to plan for for AnimeNEXT 2023.    The last in-person AnimeNEXT event was held at Atlantic City Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey in June 2019. The convention was canceled in 2020 due to COVID-19, and there was an online event in 2021.    AnimeNEXT convention suspended former convention chair and staff member Eric Torgersen in May 2019 pending an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct stemming from complaints reported to staff in 2015.

News New Jersey's AnimeNEXT Cancels 2022 Event Due to Issues with Convention Center   posted on 2022-03-31 00:17 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Center is raising prices, does not require masks, has not communicated properly with convention staff    The staff of New Jersey-based anime convention AnimeNEXT announced on Wednesday that it is calling off all public-facing attractions of AnimeNEXT 2022, which includes the in-person convention. The staff is canceling the event because of issues with the Atlantic City Convention Center, which the convention had been using since 2016.    The staff stated that the convention center is raising all prices that the event pays by 40-70% because AnimeNEXT has not occurred at the center in two years, the center does not require masks so AnimeNEXT cannot enforce policies regarding the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the nearby Orange Loop Rock Festival event is also occurring during the same weekend, and the center did not inform AnimeNEXT staff of the festival or of other necessary items.    Due to the contractual obligations, the convention staff still required to hold an ""event"" within the convention center or they would trigger multiple cancellation clauses. The staff is holding staff-only workshops and team-building exercises to plan for for AnimeNEXT 2023.    The last in-person AnimeNEXT event was held at Atlantic City Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey in June 2019. The convention was canceled in 2020 due to COVID-19, and there was an online event in 2021.    AnimeNEXT convention suspended former convention chair and staff member Eric Torgersen in May 2019 pending an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct stemming from complaints reported to staff in 2015.

News New Jersey's AnimeNEXT Cancels 2022 Event Due to Issues with Convention Center   posted on 2022-03-31 00:17 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Center is raising prices, does not require masks, has not communicated properly with convention staff    The staff of New Jersey-based anime convention AnimeNEXT announced on Wednesday that it is calling off all public-facing attractions of AnimeNEXT 2022, which includes the in-person convention. The staff is canceling the event because of issues with the Atlantic City Convention Center, which the convention had been using since 2016.    The staff stated that the convention center is raising all prices that the event pays by 40-70% because AnimeNEXT has not occurred at the center in two years, the center does not require masks so AnimeNEXT cannot enforce policies regarding the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the nearby Orange Loop Rock Festival event is also occurring during the same weekend, and the center did not inform AnimeNEXT staff of the festival or of other necessary items.    Due to the contractual obligations, the convention staff still required to hold an ""event"" within the convention center or they would trigger multiple cancellation clauses. The staff is holding staff-only workshops and team-building exercises to plan for for AnimeNEXT 2023.    The last in-person AnimeNEXT event was held at Atlantic City Convention Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey in June 2019. The convention was canceled in 2020 due to COVID-19, and there was an online event in 2021.    AnimeNEXT convention suspended former convention chair and staff member Eric Torgersen in May 2019 pending an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct stemming from complaints reported to staff in 2015.

News Neko Works Confirms Newly Announced Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game is 'Not a Joke'   posted on 2022-04-02 02:22 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    Neko Works, the creators of the Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages on Friday, April 1. The official YouTube channel began streaming the project's opening video on YouTube, which features the theme song  ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira. The channel also pinned a comment stating in English that the video posted on April Fool's Day was ""Not a Joke.""      Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls. The girls include Himawari the shiba inu, Tanpopo the pomeranian, Mimosa the chihuahua, Anemone the standard poodle, Botan the Pembroke Welsh corgi, and Calla the Siberian husky.                                             #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

News Neko Works Confirms Newly Announced Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game is 'Not a Joke'   posted on 2022-04-02 02:22 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    Neko Works, the creators of the Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages on Friday, April 1. The official YouTube channel began streaming the project's opening video on YouTube, which features the theme song  ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira. The channel also pinned a comment stating in English that the video posted on April Fool's Day was ""Not a Joke.""      Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls. The girls include Himawari the shiba inu, Tanpopo the pomeranian, Mimosa the chihuahua, Anemone the standard poodle, Botan the Pembroke Welsh corgi, and Calla the Siberian husky.                                             #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls. The girls include Himawari the shiba inu, Tanpopo the pomeranian, Mimosa the chihuahua, Anemone the standard poodle, Botan the Pembroke Welsh corgi, and Calla the Siberian husky.                                             #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.

It's been a shell of its former self for a long time, getting less relevant year after year even before the big issues happened and with all these replacements -- like Summer Games Fest, Nintendo Directs, State of Play, etc. -- out there I really don't see it come back from a multi-year hiatus in any way that truly matters.   The name still turns heads, sure. It used to be like a second Christmas in the middle of the year. And even when it wasn't, it at least was a kind of amazing shitshow that was a must-watch just for a bit of second-hand-embarrassment and a laugh. But it's not either of those things anymore. I just doesn't mean much anymore.   MAYBE in the future, once they can do a big in-person event again without many major restrictions, it matters again but even that is a big maybe.

Considering Sony wasn't even part of E3 for the last two years, it's hard to think that there were any plans to begin with.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event. And Nintendo has been sort of picking and choosing which ones to attend and which to skip, like Sony also focusing more on their own exclusive event. I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

It's been a shell of its former self for a long time, getting less relevant year after year even before the big issues happened and with all these replacements -- like Summer Games Fest, Nintendo Directs, State of Play, etc. -- out there I really don't see it come back from a multi-year hiatus in any way that truly matters.   The name still turns heads, sure. It used to be like a second Christmas in the middle of the year. And even when it wasn't, it at least was a kind of amazing shitshow that was a must-watch just for a bit of second-hand-embarrassment and a laugh. But it's not either of those things anymore. I just doesn't mean much anymore.   MAYBE in the future, once they can do a big in-person event again without many major restrictions, it matters again but even that is a big maybe.

Considering Sony wasn't even part of E3 for the last two years, it's hard to think that there were any plans to begin with.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event. And Nintendo has been sort of picking and choosing which ones to attend and which to skip, like Sony also focusing more on their own exclusive event. I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

I don't even think any of the Big 3 have been to E3 the last couple times they've had it anyway. Sony pulled out years ago and just settled for their own thing (forget the name of their event in Nov/Dec), Xbox half pulled out where they kinda show up, but then show off a bunch of stuff outside the event.

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

I don't think any of the current generation of consoles were even announced at E3 as had been the custom.   The days of the ""old"" E3 have been gone for some time now. If it survives at all, it will likely be mostly with indie developers and have more of a ""Comicon/Comiket for mostly video games"" sort of feel to it I imagine. They'll have to reinvent what the event means and how it looks, maybe tie-in and push some major esports tournament, because I don't foresee the Big 3 being major players ever again.

I wouldn't be surprised if Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft made a presentation in June around the same time E3 was suppossed to happen. I hope Nintendo will finally show some Metroid Prime 4 footage and perhaps some news about the Mario movie.            Does Microsoft even do online presentations like Nintendo and Sony?

Now everything is up in the air. The Big 3 just up and announce dates of streams randomly. I guess the companies are happy to have that freedom and developers are forced to crunch to have something ready to show. But the lack of it does kill enthusiasm for their products. The hype-cycle did serve a purpose in that regard.   Things like Nintendo Directs and State of Plays and whatever Microsoft calls theirs just don't command the attention they used to.   At least the Game Awards guarantees reveals and announcements, but you then have to sit through a bunch of other stuff you don't care about too, and those only interested in announcements from their preferred publishers and 1st parties are never guaranteed to see them there unlike dedicated events.   My enthusiasm for next-gen is in the negatives. The only 'holy-shit' moment of next-gen-ness for me was that playable Matrix UnReal demo. Call me when there are more games that match that kind of promise.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

I mean, shonen demographic manga are also full of tropes but you can always find more entertainment in them in general compared to shojo manga.           I don't think that's fair. You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers            Okay, you're really jumping the gun on those assumptions there. First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

I mean, shonen demographic manga are also full of tropes but you can always find more entertainment in them in general compared to shojo manga.           I don't think that's fair. You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.
