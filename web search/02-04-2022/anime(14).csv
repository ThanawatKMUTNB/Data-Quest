If you've been following along with my prior reviews of the manga, you'll know that I regard volume 1 to be excellent, but still clearly ...                    review          5 comments       Shaman King Episodes 14-25   Dec 22, 01:00 5 comments                 anime    I'm happy to report that the second cour is an improvement in nearly every respect, and while I can't exactly peg this show as a “great” adaptation, it's at least started to shift the needle from bad to solid, and feels more confident. ― So the first cour of the Shaman King reboot stumbled pretty hard right out of the gate, and left me with a pretty bad first impression of what to expect out of this ...                    review          3 comments       Edens Zero Episodes 13-25   Dec 18, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    The world feels bigger and bigger with each new planet that we visit while also feeling darker and more selfish along the way. ― When Edens Zero first came out, it was admittedly very difficult for many people, myself included, to judge the series on its own terms. Coming off the heels of Hiro Mashima's very successful Fairy Tail, Edens Zero did have a lot to live up to because love or hate it, its p...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago.

Although he seems to have known for much of his life that he was gay, Shun pushed that knowledge down, allowing himself to be caught up...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending.

That's true of any series, really, but at times it feels more obvious with Katarina's exploits than some others. In large part that's because it was so abundantly clear when it kept going beyond where auth...                    review          2 comments       Skip and Loafer GN 1-2   Dec 11, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    At this point it seems as if Skip and Loafer is a pure comedy series.

News Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai Live-Action Film's New Clip Features Kei Tanaka, Sara Minami   posted on 2022-04-01 20:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film based on Usamaru Furuya's manga opened in Japan on Friday    Nikkatsu began streaming a fourth clip from the live-action film of Usamaru Furuya's Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai (I Want to be Killed by a High School Girl) suspense manga on Thursday. The clip shows the protagonist Haruto Higashiyama (played by Kei Tanaka) and one of his students Maho (played by Sara Minami) cleaning up a student club room together after an earthquake, when Maho fixes Haruto's crooked tie for him.      Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai follows a man who becomes a high school teacher in his nine-year plan to be killed by a beautiful girl — even though he doesn't particularly want to die.    Kei Tanaka (.hack//The Movie, live-action Library Wars, Tokyo University Story) stars in the film as protagonist Haruto Higashiyama. Other cast members include Sara Minami as Maho, Yūmi Kawai as Aoi, Riko as Kyōko, Mizuki Kayashima as Aika, Kanata Hosoda, Natsu Katō, Nonoka Kubo, and Kin Takao. Yuko Oshima plays Satsuki Fukagawa, a psychologist and the former lover of protagonist Haruto Higashiyama.    Hideo Jōjō (Dangerous Drugs of Sex/Sei no Gekiyaku, On the Edge of Their Seats/Alps Stand no Hashi no Hō) is directing and writing the film. Alisa is performing the film's image song ""tell me i'm broken.""    Yutaka Tanito is developing and producing the film. The company Dub is producing the film, and Nikkatsu is developing and distributing.    The film opened in Japan on Friday.    Furuya (Lychee Light Club, No Longer Human, Amane Gymnasium, 51 Ways to Save Her, Genkaku Picasso) began the manga in Shinchosha's quarterly magazine Go Go Bunch  in 2013, and Shinchosha shipped the first compiled volume in February 2015. He ended the manga in July 2016, and the second and final volume shipped thereafter.

News Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai Live-Action Film's New Clip Features Kei Tanaka, Sara Minami   posted on 2022-04-01 20:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film based on Usamaru Furuya's manga opened in Japan on Friday    Nikkatsu began streaming a fourth clip from the live-action film of Usamaru Furuya's Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai (I Want to be Killed by a High School Girl) suspense manga on Thursday. The clip shows the protagonist Haruto Higashiyama (played by Kei Tanaka) and one of his students Maho (played by Sara Minami) cleaning up a student club room together after an earthquake, when Maho fixes Haruto's crooked tie for him.      Joshikōsei ni Korosaretai follows a man who becomes a high school teacher in his nine-year plan to be killed by a beautiful girl — even though he doesn't particularly want to die.    Kei Tanaka (.hack//The Movie, live-action Library Wars, Tokyo University Story) stars in the film as protagonist Haruto Higashiyama. Other cast members include Sara Minami as Maho, Yūmi Kawai as Aoi, Riko as Kyōko, Mizuki Kayashima as Aika, Kanata Hosoda, Natsu Katō, Nonoka Kubo, and Kin Takao. Yuko Oshima plays Satsuki Fukagawa, a psychologist and the former lover of protagonist Haruto Higashiyama.    Hideo Jōjō (Dangerous Drugs of Sex/Sei no Gekiyaku, On the Edge of Their Seats/Alps Stand no Hashi no Hō) is directing and writing the film. Alisa is performing the film's image song ""tell me i'm broken.""    Yutaka Tanito is developing and producing the film. The company Dub is producing the film, and Nikkatsu is developing and distributing.    The film opened in Japan on Friday.    Furuya (Lychee Light Club, No Longer Human, Amane Gymnasium, 51 Ways to Save Her, Genkaku Picasso) began the manga in Shinchosha's quarterly magazine Go Go Bunch  in 2013, and Shinchosha shipped the first compiled volume in February 2015. He ended the manga in July 2016, and the second and final volume shipped thereafter.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

MAPPA did an amazing job with these first two episodes. If I had to complain about something, I'd probably say the recap in episode 2 was a little too long, but other than that, I enjoyed the ride the whole way through.

All I can say to that is that MAPPA and Kodansha both better have a game plan for when its fans inevitably charge them for all of the anti-anxiety medication they'll need to be taking if they end up having to wait a whole extra year or two for that movie to get made.             It comes down to how many episodes this ""final"" Final Season has,as currently we're seeing one chapter per episode (plus the OP's visuals and that song) point towards movie.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

Right along the adaptation has been rearranging  a few panels from one chapter to another and vice versa but it comes down to one ""chapter"" per episode.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119 for context.            This is interesting. I was still under the impression that may be they will have everything done this time. But who would pass an opportunity to make more money with a theatrical release for the final finale of this literally titan franchise?

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

We're nearing the end of one of the biggest anime giants and it truly feels like it, and I still find it incredible how far Attack on Titan has come since season 1.   MAPPA did an amazing job with these first two episodes. If I had to complain about something, I'd probably say the recap in episode 2 was a little too long, but other than that, I enjoyed the ride the whole way through.

All I can say to that is that MAPPA and Kodansha both better have a game plan for when its fans inevitably charge them for all of the anti-anxiety medication they'll need to be taking if they end up having to wait a whole extra year or two for that movie to get made.             It comes down to how many episodes this ""final"" Final Season has,as currently we're seeing one chapter per episode (plus the OP's visuals and that song) point towards movie.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

All I can say to that is that MAPPA and Kodansha both better have a game plan for when its fans inevitably charge them for all of the anti-anxiety medication they'll need to be taking if they end up having to wait a whole extra year or two for that movie to get made.             It comes down to how many episodes this ""final"" Final Season has,as currently we're seeing one chapter per episode (plus the OP's visuals and that song) point towards movie.

Likely Season 4 Part 2 will end around the equivalent of chapter 131 (out of 139).  For further context, the next episode will start adapting chapter 119.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group     ",positive,en,{}

Point is the pacing is a mess ever since S4 started. But people will find a way to defend anything.

But people will find a way to defend anything.            Meh, pacing is okay as it is now, viewing this part purely on its own merits. Everything is given its proper weight and room to breathe, but nothing feels superfluous. What would be an issue is if the studio rushed the rest, but I don’t see them doing that with how they are treating this part, with basically not a panel’s worth of content being left out.   Instead, they seem committed to not finish during this cour… which would kind of suck if I had not already read the manga, but as far how the finished series will look like, it is irrelevant. Without prior knowledge of the source, as anime-only, I tend to not like watching series weekly anyway, and viewing the whole thing at once tends to smooth out a lot of what people might otherwise experience as pacing issues.

Anyone else feel like his death didn't have much of an impact in the anime?  Not to mention there was no time to process it.  I'd say part of it has to do with the stuff they had to cut back in S4 part 1. Granted, he was never that big of a character, but I always felt he and his rivalry with Reiner left a much more lasting impression in the manga. Meanwhile, in the anime, he was always just... kinda there, and while watching the new episode, my sister asked me what the heck Porco meant when he told Reiner ""I was always better than you""     Still, I always found it interesting how the Jaw Titan seems to be the titan of self-sacrifice. Marcel, Ymir, and Porco all gave up their lives to save someone else.   As for the second half, everything about it was great. They did the Paths justice. Heck, direction-wise, the entire episode was such a treat! I can't wait for next week.   EDIT:   I was rewatching the episode and noticed they actually included goth Mikasa and geek Armin from Attack on School Castes when Eren was entering the Paths  I also saw Reiner and co. in a sauna from that one volume cover      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 HoursGoto page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1, 2, 3 ... 9, 10, 11   Next    Page 1 of 11         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group   ",positive,en,{}

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Apr  1st 2022          Adblock+ breaks this page, consider whitelisting ANN   Welcome to Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Preview Guide! Here's how it goes: our team of critics write up their impressions instantly, to be posted here as they go along. Each critic will cover as many shows as they can handle, giving you alternate takes on most every show.    The guide is ongoing, organized by series and updated multiple times a day. Throughout the next week or two, we'll be updating as often as possible with new perspectives on new episodes from our team of critics. New reviews will be posted as soon as they're written, with each critic's name being added to the roster beneath the show's title. Check back a couple of times every day during the guide, and you're likely to see new shows pop up with multiple takes to enjoy!    Please remember that this is a preview guide. It is designed to give you a taste of the first episode of a show with a preliminary opinion and a few thoughts on whether or not the show has potential. These are not intended to be blanket judgments of these series as a whole. All reviews use the same ratings scale: 1-5, with 1 being the lowest.    Click on the survey at the top of each show's page to vote for your personal score and see how other people scored the show!   You can also check out this season's Trailer Watch Party with Lynzee Loveridge, Jacki Jing, and YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement) first impression of the season's shows.

It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

Back to top                  Generations    Joined: 21 Jul 2016 		    Posts: 172       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:01 pm            I'll be honest, I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it. And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 5:38 pm            This seems like it's taking some influence from Usagi but turning it into your typical kid Superhero cartoon, with a young, rookie, teen protagonist joining up with a group of colorful, eclectic, and capable friends to fight monsters like a Saturday Morning Cartoon.   Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 5:38 pm            This seems like it's taking some influence from Usagi but turning it into your typical kid Superhero cartoon, with a young, rookie, teen protagonist joining up with a group of colorful, eclectic, and capable friends to fight monsters like a Saturday Morning Cartoon.   Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 5:38 pm            This seems like it's taking some influence from Usagi but turning it into your typical kid Superhero cartoon, with a young, rookie, teen protagonist joining up with a group of colorful, eclectic, and capable friends to fight monsters like a Saturday Morning Cartoon.   Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

It looks more kid friendly than the original comics(they took themselves a little too seriously IMO), but Iove more action kid shows. Reminds me a lot of the nick TMNT in the mid 2010s.

And I can't say I'm a fan of it.   The trailer makes the show come off as a bit generic, with the comedy and the dialogue, and aside from all the similar names I can't see any connection to the source material at all. It may as well have been anything.   Can't say I'm interested to see this one.

Like, I think there's validity to that, but it's not really Usagi Yojimbo. I was already disappointed that this wasn't going to be a straight adaption of the comic, but even tonally it feels entirely different. The fact that his descendant gets a home base with his friends is so different from Usagi's warrior pilgrimage as a Ronin.    And, like, Usagi did way more than fight Yokai. Yokai was like the thing Usagi liked dealing with the least. He hated every time Sasuke dragged him into something involving Yokai.    Also, I'm genuinely surprised there doesn't seem to be a new version of Jei in this.

Sakai has done something like this before --- there are some ""Space Usagi"" stories set in the future, with reincarnated characters we know.  Mix in some of the stores of apprentice Usagi.   I'm guessing there's a preponderance of ""talking animals are for kids/we can't really do furry-Kurosawa"" among the boring money people, and the model they're working from is something like Kung-fu Panda more than Kubo and the two strings.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan.

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan.

ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK.

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Does ANN offer Internships? What happened to ANN UK?    About ANN  What is Anime News Network (ANN)? Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.

Anime News Network was created as a news source that focuses on the medium of Japanese Animation(anime) and Japanese Comics (manga). ANN was founded by Justin Sevakis in July of 1998, and has since lead the online anime news medium with a tradition of strong unbiased coverage of major breaking news. With in-depth coverage, analysis and commentary to provide insight into the world of anime and manga, ANN has been and continues to be the #1 English language source for anime and manga news on the Internet. ANN's goal is to make the latest, most comprehensive Anime news available to new fans and veteran Otaku alike.  What ANN is not:  A television network or station; A subsidiary of another company; A dubbing / voice recording studio; An animation company; A licensing or distribution company; A manufacturer or distributor of merchandise; For sale.    What is anime? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of anime, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, anime is animation that is primarily produced and conceived in Japan. This includes animation conceived in Japan that has portions outsourced to other countries, but does not include animation primarily produced outside Japan and with the animation outsourced to Japan. It does however include animation that is co-conceived inside and outside of Japan and at least partially produced inside Japan.  What is manga? For a full definition, including controversy regarding the definition of manga, please see our lexicon. For all purposes related to Anime News Network, manga are comic books or strips that are produced and conceived in Japan. This includes include comics that are co-conceived inside and outside of Japan but produced in Japan.  Who operates ANN? ANN is operated by a team of people, under the guidance of Christopher Macdonald, Daniel DeLorme, Zac Bertschy, Egan Loo and Hori Shinsuke. A full list of the staff can be found on the staff page.   Who owns ANN? The website is owned by Anime News Network Inc., a privately owned corporation. The corporation's shareholders include: Christopher Macdonald (Minority owner, controlling shareholder), Hori Shinsuke (Minority owner), Anime Consortium Japan (Minority owner), others.   Where is ANN based? Wow, that question is so 1999! ANN is based everywhere and nowhere. We're based on the Internet! We don't have an office; our staff all work at home and are based around the world with the most full-time staff based in Japan and the United States. Anime News Network, Inc. the corporation that maintains ANN is a Canadian corporation.  Who is the mascot? When the site was first launched in 1998 it featured a blond-haired mascot named Jadress, created by Robin Sevakis. She was eventually replaced by Nina, who was featured in a webcomic (also created by Robin Sevakis) that ran from 2007 to 2013.  How often do you update? The site is run on a daily content format, as opposed to a monthly or bi-monthly magazine format. We update the news and reviews daily, and other content, such as features, columns, and editorials are also added throughout the week. Our encyclopedia is updated daily as well.  Under what settings is ANN best viewed? The site uses a responsive design that should look good at any resolution, from smartphones to large desktop screens.  How do I find older articles on ANN? Links to archives for news, features, columns, reviews, etc. can be found in their respective sections in the menu. You can also use the search engine.  What was used to make the site, as well as maintain it? The site is a combination of older parts in PHP and newer parts in Ruby, with a MySQL database to manage the content. Apart from the phpBB forum, we haven't used any pre-made packages; all the content is managed and presented with custom software.  How do I get permission to reprint an ANN Story, or obtain an ANN graphic or photo? ANN has a newsfeed program where you can get the latest anime news headlines on your very own website. If you wish to entirely reprint anything on your site please contact the editors. For more details about what you can and can not re-print with or without our permission, see our copyright statement.  How many people hear or read an ANN story? We get a bit over 200,000 visits every day. In addition to regular visitors, ANN's news is often sourced in print and occasionally on the airwaves.  How can I get in touch with the staff? Visit our contact page or visit our staff page for further contact and personal information. If a member's e-mail address is not there you can send your comments to the editors and we'll forward them.  Do you attend any public events? Yes. ANN tries to provide coverage to as many anime conventions/festivals/symposiums as our staff can manage. For more details on this see our events section and our events forum.  Do you have a newsfeed? You really should have an RSS newsfeed! Look at our newsfeed section for links to various RSS & Atom feeds as well as our custom newsfeed program. Submitting Content  How should I submit news ? Send an e-mail to [email protected] , this e-mail address is regularly monitored by several staff (someone is always ""on duty""). Other methods (e-mail directly to staff, PM, Forum, Twitter, etc...) are less reliable, and may lead to delays and/or a complete failure to notice your submission.  I have something to say about an online petition. Stop. Virtually every e-petition is a waste of time.   I submitted a news item, why wasn't it posted? We could still be in the process of verifying the details, we may not have been able to verify the items, or perhaps we didn't find it newsworthy enough to post. On a ""slow"" news day we're more likely to post less significant items.  I submitted a news item, why was it credited to someone else? They either submitted it first--or more importantly--submitted more information.  Can I submit news about a non-Japanese animation? No. We're Anime News Network, not ""Animation News Network"", not ""Asian Animation Network."" There's plenty of good animation from around the world, including Korea and China, but we only cover Japanese animation, not French, Mexican, Chinese, African, Korean or Afghanistanimation.  Can I submit a review? / How do I become a reviewer? Anime News Network does not accept unsolicited reviews. Take a quick look at the Staff Openings page, if there is an opening, it will be mentioned there. More often than not, we hire experienced writers who are known to us. Best piece of advice we can give is to make a name for yourself then we'll come to you when the time is right.  Can I submit an article? If you are an experienced writer/journalist with a portfolio you can point to, please E-mail the editors and ask about the topic, we'd be glad to consider your article idea.  Can I have a column? No. Only previous, regular contributors who have shown an ability to consistently write timely, quality articles (or reviews) are permitted to write columns. Try submitting some articles or reviews first.  Information X is missing from the Encyclopedia, can you add it? We can't add it, but YOU can. The Encyclopedia is a user-contributed database; it's made specially so that you can add missing information by yourself. You just need a user account. So please do take the time to register and submit the information you found was missing. Each page contains pointers about how to add information, and if that's not enough you can check the Encyclopedia FAQ or the memoranda.  How can I contribute to the encyclopedia? Any registered user can contribute standard data to the Encyclopedia for Anime, Manga and People. But if that's not enough for you and you're near the top of the contributors list and you'd like to help out with the releases, lexicon, or editing and verifying data submitted by other people, please contact the Encyclopedist.  Please note, that we'll be looking for someone who is inputting quality data, not just large amounts of data.   What if I want to contribute in some other way? We always appreciate whatever help and support that readers can give. If you'd like to help out at ANN in a way other than the ones described above, please contact the editors. There's so much to do at ANN that we're very appreciative of any help offered.   My company is making Anime, can you post a news article about it? Sorry, too many companies are trying to cash in on the popularity of Anime by making cartoons with big eyes and purple hair. We're sure you aren't like that, but... well actually, we aren't sure.  Why doesn't Anime News Network review world manga? Please see our definition of manga. It is Anime News Network's official position, and the personal belief of many of our staff, than there is nothing inheritently superior about Japanese manga when compared to world manga. However Anime News Network's purpose is to cover Japanese animation and comic books. Currently we do not have the resources to review all the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America. If and when we are able to review 100% of the Japanese anime and manga that are released in North America, we will then consider expanding our area of review coverage to include manga-style comics (world manga) that originate outside of Japan.  Why didn't you post a news article about my (company's) new Anime or Manga? If your item is picked up in a distribution deal by a company that isn't being run out of someone's garage, then maybe its newsworthy. So when that happens, give us a shout, and we'll consider it, but if you can't tell us what makes your creation manga or anime (other than big eyes, purple hair and the like) you can pretty much forget it.  May I send you my company's product to review? If it's anime or manga-related, then yes. Contact editors[at]animenewsnetwork.com for shipping information.  I'm starting a new webmanga, is it news? No, there are a billion and one ""webmangas"", and most only last a couple of months. Now, if your webmanga gets licensed by a publisher... that might be news.  Can you mention my site? Only if you do something newsworthy, sorry.  Why have we been blacklisted? ANN has a 2-strikes rule regarding inappropriate PR. After 2 strikes for the following reasons we will blacklist your company or PR firm (when we blacklist a PR firm, we notify their relevant clients). i) Completely irrelevant PR that has nothing to do with anime, manga, Japanese pop-culture or any other related content; ii) Unauthorized stealth marketing on our forums; iii) Harassing our staff; iv) Continued PR submissions to inappropriate e-mail address. v) Any attempt to illicitly influence editorial We'll send you a link to this post after your first offense. After your second offense you'll never hear from us again (and our readers will never hear from you or your clients).  Isn't this a bit harsh? Perhaps, but we're tired of getting PRs for toilets, accounting firm management changes and World War 2 museums.   But we offer an opt-out! Clicking that link might opt us out of all your press releases, including your relevant ones. It would be the same as blacklisting you, without giving you the warning. Showing you this warning is actually less harsh than clicking your opt-out.  Forum / Account  I didn't receive my forum registration. If you are using a spam filter, please check your spam folder, some mail servers catch the registration code as spam. Search your spamfolder & inbox for e-mail from [email protected] or [email protected]. If you are using any sort of white list, please make sure that your e-mail account is set up to accept e-mails from [email protected] and [email protected]. If you are using a mail service that bounces the e-mail back to the sender and asks them to confirm that it is not spam, we will not do that. These services usually allow you to add the e-mail address to a white-list before hand. Once you have checked all of the above, you can have the server re-send you your activation code by going here. It should be instant, but sometimes e-mail is slow, give it a couple hours (the slowness is usually not because of our server). If you still don't get your activation code, then and ONLY then, e-mail us at [email protected] make sure that: 1) Your e-mail is sent from the e-mail address you submitted to ANN; 2) You include your user name; 3) Do not send us your password; 4) The subject of your e-mail must be ""activation code"".   How do I become a moderator? You're invited. When we feel there is a need for a new moderator, we look at our best forum users (the ones that contribute intelligently to conversation and act maturely) and ask them if they'd be willing to help us moderate the forum.  Will there ever be an off topic / general conversation forum among the forums? Not in the public areas, no. We do however maintain a community section for subscribers, and off-topic discussion is permitted there.  Why aren't my posts showing up? Posts from new users sometimes take a while to show up. Please be patient, they should appear within a few hours. Believe it or not, this is a ""feature"" not a ""bug.""  Is there a set of forum rules? Right here - read them if you haven't already.  Help, I've been banned or moderated! Read this.  How do I attach a picture (avatar) to my account? Read this.  Can I change my user name? You can make changes in your user account settings. But because other users depend on your username to recognize you, we have a ""no identity switcheroos"" policy: once you start using the forum we do not allow changes to your username beyond punctuation and capitalization.  Can I delete my account? Yes, you can. Go to your account settings page and you will be able to delete your account from there. Contests  Can I enter give-aways more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No.  Can I enter creative contests more than once? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, Yes.  Does ANN ""own"" my entry? Unless stated otherwise on the contest page, No. But as a condition of your entry we generaly require you to give us the unrevocable right to display your entry on Anime News Network for all eternity.  Can I display my entry elsewhere? Yes, anywhere you please, unless otherwise stated in the contest rules.  Why do I have to put your logo and/or the sponsor's logo on my submission There are two reasons for this. First, it adds some extra benefit to the contest sponsors and second, it helps us insure that you made the entry for the contest, instead of just grabing some existing art and submiting it.  Explain those rules about where I live and whether or not I can enter and if you will ship me a prize. Most of our contest are open to anyone, regardless of where you live, because we don't believe in geographic discrimination. However sometimes our sponsors want a contest to only be open to their potential clients, so in those cases we have no choice to abide by their request to limit contest entry to a certain geographic area. While we don't believe in geographic discrimination, we also don't believe in spending a fortune on shipping and trying to figure out custom laws in order to get you your prize so that's why we only ship to the USA and Canada.   What does a complete mailing address look like? Short answer: ""It's what we need to put on a package to mail it to you."" It looks something like this:  416 William St. #402 Moralton, SS 70707 USA 24 Sussex Dr Ottawa, ON  K1A 0A3 Canada 1000 J.P. Laurel St. San Miguel 1005, Manila  Philippines   You'd be amazed at how many people enter our contests and leave out critical mailing information like their city, province/state and or postal/zip code. You'd also be amazed at how many people ask us ""What do you mean by complete mailing address?"" In fact, if you're reading this, it's quite possible that we referred you here because you asked that very question. Since we usually only ship to the USA and Canada, we won't disqualify you for leaving out the country, but if anything else is missing, we'll just pick another winner to replace you. We will not contact you to verify your mailing address. BTW, your name is not part of your mailing address, but we won't disqualify you for putting it in there...  Why do some contests not ship to PO Boxes? ANN usually doesn't handle shipping for our contest prizes. Shipping is done by the contest sponsor. If the contest states ""no PO boxes"" this is because our sponsor requested it. Most likely it is because they are shipping via a courier like UPS, which will not ship to PO boxes.  I'd really prefer it if you didn't post my name & city if I win This is done for legal reasons, sorry. That said, if you want to enter with an alias, that's fine as long as you are certain the package will reach you (we can't guarantee it will).  Why did you stop accepting art contest entries from Facebook By default, Facebook posts usually aren't public. Most people who submit Facebook URLs to our art contests forget to share their entries publicly, and we are often forced to disqualify these entries. It's better to just avoid the problem altogether. If you want to enter with Facebook, and you remember to make your entry public go ahead, we'll accept it. But if you forget to share it properly, we will simply ignore your entry.   Miscellaneous   Can I link to you? Yes, please feel free. Currently we don't have any banners to offer you for this, we'll be making some new ones shortly.  Can you link to me? No. We are not a link exchange site.  Wait, I can link to you, but you won't link to me?? Yes, we know it sounds a little conceited of us, but that's how it is. To be fair, we don't expect you to link to us, but we're honored if you do decide that you'd like to link to our site despite the fact that we won't be returning the favor. Please don't link to us if you're only doing it because you hope to get something in return; link to us because you feel that you want more people to know about Anime News Network.   Can we trade banners? Sorry, ANN relies on its banners to survive. We very seldom trade banners with another website or publication. If your publication is in print (10 000+ circulation) or a website with 10 million+ impressions per month, we may consider it. Please understand, ANN receives this question at least once a week, it isn't possible for us to even consider swapping / affiliating with so many sites, so we generally don't swap / affiliate with any.  Can you affiliate with us? Anime News Network would be happy to setup an affiliate program with any online store that pays referral fees provided that store meets certain pre-requisites. Anime News Network is unfortunately unable to affiliate itself with fan-sites much for the same reason that we can not link to you or trade banners with you (see above two entries).  Why'd you give this show a rating of ... in your review? Clearly it deserved a ... ! Obviously our reviewer disagrees.  When is title X coming out, how many episodes is it, and/or who is releasing it? Look it up in the encyclopedia, ask Answerman, or ask in the forum.  Why'd you make X change to the programming on [Cartoon Network, YTV, etc]? Uhh, try contacting the broadcaster, network or station. We're a news site and we have no more control over the schedule at [TV Station] than any other media source. Yes, believe it or not we get this question every so often.  I'd like to license, work on, be involved with, etc... one of your titles Just like we aren't involved in TV broadcasting, we are not licensors. Even for shows that we stream on ANN, we are not authorized to sub-license them to other companies. Contact the producers or the licensors, not us.  I'd like permission to do something with one of your titles Sorry, we do not control copyright permissions for any anime or manga. If you need permission to do something, contact the local licensee / master licensor; or failing that, contact the master licensor in Japan. A bit of advice though, for personal, non commercial projects, don't bother contacting them unless you absolutely need permission. They don't care if you make a 1-off t-shirt to wear to school, but if you ask them, they'll probably say ""No,"" as a matter of policy. Sorry we can not help you get in contact with a rights holder.  Why'd you take my video show off YouTube? We get this question a lot. We didn't take your video down. See the above answer as well as the first one. ANN has no involvement in the process of taking pirated materials off of websites like YouTube. For your information, the material was probably taken down because it was uploaded without permission (therefore illegally) and the licensors want you to watch it somewhere they will make money (on DVD, on TV, or on an authorized website). Go here for a list of places where you can legally watch anime and support the creators at the same time.  On a related note, allow us to point out that your video was probably automatically removed by a technology called video-fingerprinting. By this semi-automated process, YouTube removes videos that it believes infringe on copyrights without waiting for complaints from copyright holders. So it's quite possible that no anime company was involved in the removal of your video.   Sadly, this process can affect videos that are legitimate ""fair-use."" Even more sadly, the employees at the anime companies are too busy to bother reading all the e-mails they get about videos (the vast majority of are from morons that don't understand that ""I wasn't making money"" doesn't make it okay) so you can e-mail them to your hearts content, but they probably won't answer (not because they're fan-hating assholes, but because they don't have the time).    If you believe your video is legitimate fair-use (full episodes are never fair use, significant episode clips are rarely fair use, AMVs are almost never fair use of the music) try posting it again and include in the description why you feel it is fair use. If you're lucky, YouTube will take this into consideration (some videos are deleted automatically, others are looked at by a human employee at YouTube after the fingerprinting process identifies them) and not delete your video. You really should read up on ""fair use"" before you make any claims that your video is fair use though. And by ""read-up,"" we mean read professional, expert explanations, not your friend's blog.   I have a great idea for an anime or manga, where do I submit it? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not involved with the creation process of any anime or manga and we can not put you in contact with creators (more on that here). Finally, we'd recommend you read this and this.  How do I get your television channel? See Question #1 ""What is Anime News Network (ANN)?. Anime News Network is not The Anime Network (TAN). For details on TAN, read the transcript of our chat with them, read our TAN news coverage, or visit their website.  Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? No. As a policy, ANN never gives out contact information. Don't send us this question unless you've exhausted every other resource available (phone book, 411, Google, their website, etc...), even then, we will only forward your request to them, and we will only do so provided it is a business-to-business request being made by a company we've actually heard of. If you can't find Hayao Miyazaki's e-mail address online, it's probably because he doesn't want to receive a thousand e-mails a day. The one exception to this rule is that we will give out the Public Relations / Press Relations (PR) contact information for a company provided we have it readily available. Generally you can find this information on your own though, so please don't be lazy. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? I'm an old acquaintance of theirs. The answer is still no. Can you put me in contact with [insert actor, company or any person in the Anime industry]? They worked on one of your projects. Just to be clear, our encyclopedia carries information about a myriad of projects (anime,manga, etc...) most of which (99.9%) Anime News Network is not, and never was, involved with. It is not a list of our projects. So if the person actually worked for ANN, please see this answer, but if they are one of the 67023+ people listed in the encyclopedia, they probably didn't work for us and therefore the previous two answers apply. Okay, I understand, you can't or won't put me in contact with them, but I really want/need to contact this person. Can you offer any suggestions on how to proceed? Depending on who you're trying to contact, they might have a fanclub, official webpage, or e-mail address listed in their encyclopedia entry. If not, try looking for the latest production they worked on and contacting the production company, they might be able and willing to forward your e-mail. Just a note, if you're contacting someone in Japan, it's highly recommended that at least your intro be in Japanese. Even if your intended recipient understands English, the person you ask to forward your e-mail might not. For your benefit, here's a quick intro you can prepend to any e-mail you send to Japan (replaces the blanks by the name of the person you are trying to contact): ご担当者様へ お世話になっております。 本社は____様にご連絡を取りたがっています。お手数ですが、このメールを____様へ転送して頂けないでしょうか? 宜しくお願いします。  Literally: To whom it may concern/the person in charge: Thank you for your time. We are trying to contact _____. If it isn't too much trouble, could you forward this e-mail to ____? Thank you very much.    Can you send me your catalog? We don't have a catalog, we don't sell anything.  Where can I buy Anime ? You can buy it at retail movie stores like Blockbuster and Suncoast as well as specialty Anime Shops. You can also buy it online at websites like Anime Castle, Anime Nation, J List, Roberts Anime Corner Store and The Right Stuf International.  Where can I download anime or watch it online? For the most part, you can't legally download anime online. Fansubs are generally illegal (whether or not they're unethical is a completely different topic), and as such, we can't help you obtain them. You might want to check the sites listed below, and read our news, when there's legal anime to download or watched online we generally mention it.  Don't ask us where to get bootlegs or fansubs, we won't tell you.  Some sites/services that allow you to download or watch anime online legally(may or may not be free):  Amazon Prime crunchyroll Funimation's Website HiDive Apple iTunes hulu Netflix Viz Anime  * Why isn't YouTube listed? Because a lot of the content on YouTube is illegally uploaded. One day we'll have an index of legal anime on YouTube, but until then we aren't listing it as a site where all content is legal/authorized.   How do I watch anime on ANN? ANN has stopped streaming anime episodes. Go to the websites above!  Can you help me with my school assignment No. We get this question about once a week, and we don't really want to spend 25 hours a year answering school questions. The worst part is that most people who e-mail us are actually asking us to provide information they could find with a little bit of research, in other words, they're asking us to do their work for them. On the other hand, if you're working on a master's project or PhD thesis related to anime, that interests us, so we'd probably be more than happy to help.  Does ANN offer Internships? Yes, Anime News Network offers internships in our newsroom and our web-development departments. Further details are available here   What happened to ANN UK? In late May the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect. The EU determined that any website targeting European readers would be ""doing business in Europe."" Anime News Network does not disagree with this conclusion. Unfortunately, the GDPR requires all websites doing business in Europe to meet a stringent set of privacy regulations. While ANN supports the intent of these regulations, some of them are extremely difficult to comply with. While it is our intention, for the benefit of all readers our readers around the world, to comply with these new standards, we are not able to do so immediately. Once we are fully compliant with GDPR requirements, we will re-launch ANN UK. In the meantime, ANN's global edition is available to all readers worldwide and is the default version for readers outside of North America, Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia.
