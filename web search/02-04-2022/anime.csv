This is turning out to be a surprisingly fun and cute show. MAO and Satoshi Hino are really delivering as their respective characters, and the comedy writing is on-point.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1148       Posted: Wed Jan 19, 2022 4:17 pm              Quote:    While the characters (and possibly the show itself) might insist that's the work of the mysterious curse placed on them by the Goddess, it's equally possible this genderbending chicanery has just opened the door for both parties to consider possibilities they never dared to consider while both had male bodies.           Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

It has gone well past my expectations and is all set to save my genderbender-loving heart this season.            yeah gender bent Isekai has to focus on that fact or give a good reason why the fact is plot irrelevant. the pupil one does neither, one unnamed game Isekai does something pretty clever the male mc does not seem to be affected by the gender change but as the plot progresses he realizes he is acting more and more like the game character, so there is something fishy going on, as in , his personality is meeting with the original body owner and that is why he never felt the gender change.   I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

This is turning out to be a surprisingly fun and cute show. MAO and Satoshi Hino are really delivering as their respective characters, and the comedy writing is on-point.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1148       Posted: Wed Jan 19, 2022 4:17 pm              Quote:    While the characters (and possibly the show itself) might insist that's the work of the mysterious curse placed on them by the Goddess, it's equally possible this genderbending chicanery has just opened the door for both parties to consider possibilities they never dared to consider while both had male bodies.           Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

REVIEW: Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout            Goto page 1, 2, 3, 4  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Wed Jan 19, 2022 3:50 pm            A gender-flipped Isekai (totally not BL) romcom!

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I love what the reviewer painted out for telulilo , it confirms the theory that source readers felt similar and spoiler[telulilo is gone asap and the author later tries with other characters]      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3764       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 11:03 am            I feel both amused and kind of bad for the elf Premier for how badly this episode went for her.

She Professed Herself the Pupil of the Wise Man came off as the author just adding the gender bender tag to make their WN stick out amongst all the other 'cute girl doing cute things' stories on the WN website since the gender bending aspect basically is irrelevant as the MC acts fully like a girl from the very start.

I have read through the first few arcs and I (Mildly) disagree with that.  The MC expresses a lot of dismay and embarrassment over it, though I think that secretly the form pleases them.   In the Anime.. yeah, she doesn't miss a beat.   In the WN, she spends a lot of time mourning the loss of the ""Wizened Wizard"" persona, off and on, but at a certain point seems to give up and embrace the new form.  Not a lot of time is spent on it, and.. it is not exactly a very deep WN.

Then Tachibana flipped that back.  So I guess we had similar reactions, but in opposite directions, which, if that was their intention, was pretty clever.   Boyfriend shirt was pure gold.  Not too crazy about the demon lord's hyper gremlin though.

Once they introduced ""Charmed"" Jinguuji  didn't stand a chance, now all the Otome cliché's are truly out to get him....    ""Boyfriend shirt"" - top anime couple trigger...   Having re-watched the first episode the goddess didn't specifically mention what the curse was apart from the desire to ""defeat the demon king"". So they're probably suffering from their bromance being magnified now the potential homosexual hang-up has been removed.   Schwa-kun makes a good Kirito parody and if his real name is reveled and it is an SAO reference it'll be all the better.

She seems pretty chill and cool, and gets along well with Schwa.   Ah, Tachibana thinks Jinguuji is as powerful as a sacred weapon! Which did pay off in their new fantasy life.   I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

I guess this is the last we'll see of Schwa and co. since he's sticking around in the village. Well, at least they respect him now. His Goddess has no idea he lost his sword though.    Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

Poor Elf Premier. Gets kidnapped and the pair don't lift a finger to save her, then she thinks she's going to be ravished...then sacrificed...all because she's so beautiful...and then Tachibana steals her thunder.

This is turning out to be a surprisingly fun and cute show. MAO and Satoshi Hino are really delivering as their respective characters, and the comedy writing is on-point.      Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1148       Posted: Wed Jan 19, 2022 4:17 pm              Quote:    While the characters (and possibly the show itself) might insist that's the work of the mysterious curse placed on them by the Goddess, it's equally possible this genderbending chicanery has just opened the door for both parties to consider possibilities they never dared to consider while both had male bodies.           Maybe it's just me but I thought that this was made amply clear in episode two the latest... but even in episode one Jinguuji calls Tachibana his ""paradise"", the only one at whose side he feels comfortable, etc., is aghast at the idea of his ""best friend"" being taken away from him by some wench, and generally behaves like any ""super darling"" type romantic male lead. And then in episode two his ""I love this about you"" moment prompts a long flashback about male!Tachibana...    The premise may be problematic (I don't necessarily see it as such though) but I don't think the show has ever tried to insist that their feelings are actually the work of the curse. If anything I think it's going in a ""you were always in love you just didn't realize it because both of you were guys"" direction.

The character has since appeared in countless video games, anime series and other media. It was also recently confirmed that Miku will appear in a special crossover series called Dropkick on My Devil! X Mame Anime, which will promote the island of Hokkaido. However, this isn't Hatsune Miku's first anime appearance -- nor is it the weirdest. In 2018, Hatsune Miku appeared in an anime called Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion. This train-based mecha series, created by Takara Tomy and Japan Railways Group, follows a young boy who loves trains named Hayato Hayasugi. One day, Hayato learns his father is secretly working for the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute, a secretive organization that creates Shinkalions to fight monsters that try to attack Japan. The boy turns out to have an aptitude for piloting Shinkalions and becomes the pilot of the Shinkalion E5 Hayabusa.

Hayato and his friends realize their mysterious foe is planning to spread panic by revealing monsters to the world, and they're soon proved right when one attacks Hakodate in Hokkaido. The pilots dive into their Shinkalions and head there to fight, but realize they're not going to make it in time. However, before the plan can come to fruition, another Shinkalion enters the fray. Hayato and his friends are initially confused when they learn the pilot is a girl with distinctive blue twin tails and a robotic voice. This girl holds the monster off, eventually destroying it with her robot's finishing move. After the battle, she introduces herself as Hatsune Miku. However, this Miku differs a little from her usual forms found in other media. Here, she is an eleven-year-old girl who wants to become a Shinkalion driver but is held back by motion sickness. When Hayato falls ill, Miku once again must dive into battle in her Shinkalion, proving herself as a pilot. Shinkalion's Miku lore is full of references to the original Vocaloid. The character is voiced by Saki Fujita, the actress whose voice is the basis for the singer's voicebank. Her age of 11 references the fact that the Miku voicebank was 11 years old at the time of the episode's release. Her being based at the Shinkansen Ultra Evolution Institute's Hokkaido Branch references the headquarters of Crypton Future Media -- the company behind the Miku voicebank.

She would show up several times during the series and also appears in the movie Shinkansen Henkei Robo Shinkalion the Movie: The Marvelous Fast ALFA-X That Comes From the Future. This film reveals that in the time since the end of the original series, Miku has become a singer just like her Vocaloid counterpart. Her appearance here also means she has fought against a form of Godzilla and fought alongside Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion, further proving that Shinkalion is home to some of anime's most unexpected crossovers. Dropkick On My Devil will not be the last time Miku is seen in an anime. She's become such a part of anime fan culture that she'll inevitably make another crossover or cameo appearance. However, it will be hard to top her Shinkalion role for pure weirdness, especially as the anime made Miku a unique character in its own universe while paying tribute to the original Vocaloid. This cameo also tops the oddity charts because it means that Miku has technically crossed over with loads of other franchises due to Shinkalion's own number of cameos and crossovers.

By Diane Darcy Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Episode 12 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest, ""The Strongest Sage Goes on a Journey Again,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In Episode 1 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest, Gaius induced his reincarnation to obtain the four crests he desired. In the era of his original incarnation, the four crests were considered the most powerful in battle. 5,000 years later, Gaius is reborn with the four crests as a boy named Matthias “Matty” Hildesheimer, although in this timeline, the four crests is rejected as the weakest. As such, he was only able to enroll in the second-tier magic school known as the Second Academy in the kingdom of Eis.  Throughout the series, Matty reveals that he retained the memories of his past incarnation and uses his past life experiences in battles against demons. He also reveals through exposition the magical tools he invented in his past life that allow him to win fights against demons with little to no effort. During his stay at the Second Academy, Matty befriended his classmates Lurie and Alma, although he hasn't said anything about who he really is to them. Along the way, he was also reacquainted with his old friend Iris the darkness dragon -- the only one who knows his secret. RELATED: The Strongest Sage Meets His Equal as a Demon Slayer                  After stopping various demonic invasions throughout the series, Matty encountered a demonic presence he couldn't beat: the ancient demon Zardias who knew him as Gaius. Since that discovery, Matty set about locating the demon, which required the use of an ancient device he invented. Unfortunately for Matty, Zardias broke out of his magic prison the moment he determined his location and set course for the kingdom of Eis. With his resident kingdom in danger, Matty tasks Lurie and Alma with retrieving an ancient sword he invented in his former life while he battles Zardias alongside Iris. The fight against Zardias proves to be nothing like Matty's earlier battles. Zardias is a lot stronger and deadlier than the demons Matty previously defeated, and his strategies don't work on the ancient demon. On top of that, Zardias shows he has tricks of his own, one of which ends up wounding Matty. This forces Matty to realize he'll have to sacrifice his current incarnation to defeat the demon, or humanity is done for. Since letting humanity die is not an option for Matty, he contemplates using his remaining magic to kill the demon and perform another reincarnation spell to save himself. While reincarnation is Matty's only viable option in a deadly situation, there's one problem: if he reincarnates into another future timeline, Lurie and Alma will no longer be part of his life, as they will be long dead. Realizing he has grown fond of both girls and wants to remain with them along with Iris, Matty decides to hold off the demon a bit longer until Lurie arrives with the sword he needs. While Lurie does succeed at her task, Zardias delivers a fatal attack on Matty when he's not looking, successfully killing him. RELATED: The Strongest Sage: A Demonic Encounter Nearly Kills a Powerful Demon Slayer                  Seeing Matty brutally killed before her eyes proves too much for Lurie to handle. This feeling is only made worse by the fact she had given Matty the sword just seconds before Zardias impaled him with his own weapon. Before Lurie has the chance to grieve Matty's death, however, the sword in his possession activates and restores him to life. The sword also restores his magic, making him stronger and more powerful than before. This gives Matty the power boost he needs to destroy Zardias, which he does quickly without any consequence to himself. In the aftermath of the battle, everything in the kingdom of Eis returns to normal as if the threat of Zardias never happened. Even after his brief run-in with death, Matty doesn't seem fazed by the events that transpired. Lurie, however, is very shaken by the experience and admits her feelings for Matty by hugging him. While Matty doesn't use this opportunity to reciprocate her feelings, he does decide to do something nice for her to subtly let her know how much she means to him. While out shopping with the reward money he earned for defeating Zardias, Matty buys a blue stone that he reshapes into a pendant for a necklace. When he asks Lurie to meet him in private one night, Lurie thinks the intimate nature of their meeting is going to lead to them kissing. However, Matty only gives her the necklace he made for her. Although Lurie is grateful for Matty's gift, she doesn't take it as romantic confirmation of his feelings. Matty also doesn't use this opportunity to tell her the truth of who he really is or his past as Gaius as a way of progressing their relationship. This indicates that while Matty does love Lurie, he also doesn't trust her enough to tell her his secret. As such, The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest ends its first season on a rather anticlimactic note.

02-04-2022,anime,1,0,,Strongest Sage’s Finale Falls Flat,"   The Strongest Sage’s Final Episode Leaves a Lot to Be Desired Matty Hildesheimer's life is on the line as he battles the powerful ancient demon Zardias in The Strongest Sage season finale, but is victory earned?     By Diane Darcy Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Episode 12 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest Crest, ""The Strongest Sage Goes on a Journey Again,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In Episode 1 of The Strongest Sage With The Weakest, Gaius induced his reincarnation to obtain the four crests he desired. In the era of his original incarnation, the four crests were considered the most powerful in battle. 5,000 years later, Gaius is reborn with the four crests as a boy named Matthias “Matty” Hildesheimer, although in this timeline, the four crests is rejected as the weakest. As such, he was only able to enroll in the second-tier magic school known as the Second Academy in the kingdom of Eis.  Throughout the series, Matty reveals that he retained the memories of his past incarnation and uses his past life experiences in battles against demons. He also reveals through exposition the magical tools he invented in his past life that allow him to win fights against demons with little to no effort. During his stay at the Second Academy, Matty befriended his classmates Lurie and Alma, although he hasn't said anything about who he really is to them. Along the way, he was also reacquainted with his old friend Iris the darkness dragon -- the only one who knows his secret. RELATED: The Strongest Sage Meets His Equal as a Demon Slayer                  After stopping various demonic invasions throughout the series, Matty encountered a demonic presence he couldn't beat: the ancient demon Zardias who knew him as Gaius. Since that discovery, Matty set about locating the demon, which required the use of an ancient device he invented. Unfortunately for Matty, Zardias broke out of his magic prison the moment he determined his location and set course for the kingdom of Eis. With his resident kingdom in danger, Matty tasks Lurie and Alma with retrieving an ancient sword he invented in his former life while he battles Zardias alongside Iris. The fight against Zardias proves to be nothing like Matty's earlier battles. Zardias is a lot stronger and deadlier than the demons Matty previously defeated, and his strategies don't work on the ancient demon. On top of that, Zardias shows he has tricks of his own, one of which ends up wounding Matty. This forces Matty to realize he'll have to sacrifice his current incarnation to defeat the demon, or humanity is done for. Since letting humanity die is not an option for Matty, he contemplates using his remaining magic to kill the demon and perform another reincarnation spell to save himself. While reincarnation is Matty's only viable option in a deadly situation, there's one problem: if he reincarnates into another future timeline, Lurie and Alma will no longer be part of his life, as they will be long dead. Realizing he has grown fond of both girls and wants to remain with them along with Iris, Matty decides to hold off the demon a bit longer until Lurie arrives with the sword he needs. While Lurie does succeed at her task, Zardias delivers a fatal attack on Matty when he's not looking, successfully killing him. RELATED: The Strongest Sage: A Demonic Encounter Nearly Kills a Powerful Demon Slayer                  Seeing Matty brutally killed before her eyes proves too much for Lurie to handle.

Here's a preview for the highly-anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie.     By Louis Kemner Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 anime season will be filled with a colorful variety of new and returning series, from Season 2 of the isekai adventure The Rising of the Shield Hero to the return of the beloved Netflix hit Komi Can't Communicate. But Komi has some fresh new competition this season, including the highly anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This brand new series features a small but lovable cast of main characters, most of whom are high school students living their ordinary lives. The charming heroine Shikimori, however, is anything but an ordinary student. She promises to be a shojo-style shonen heroine unlike any other when the story begins airing on Crunchyroll in April. Here's a brief preview of what to expect.  RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 The Premise Of Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie                  Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a fresh new slice-of-life romance/comedy anime, in a similar vein to popular series such as Komi Can't Communicate and the beloved Horimiya. Although Shikimori isn't about to redefine the possibilities of high school or slice-of-life anime, the series should appeal to any fan who can't get enough of the genre while also looking for assertive, strong female leads who can carry an entire series on their own. More and more anime today are giving girls a chance to shine as the protagonist in a variety of genres, from Komi Shoko to Love of Kill's seinen-style shojo heroine Chateau Dankworth. It's a trend that is absolutely worth continuing in the spring season with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This anime stars the shonen heroine Shikimori, a lively pink-haired student who is definitely the more assertive and dynamic member of her relationship with the meek but kind Izumi. During their idyllic high school days together, Shikimori will take the lead as the attention-grabbing star who can do it all, from competitive sports in gym class to being an everyday hero who can rescue her boyfriend from harm when things go wrong -- and she's an ace student to boot. Shikimori is also known for giving off harsh glares that can make anyone back off and not want to mess with her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Izumi mainly just follows her lead, but over time he may grow more assertive as well and make something of himself. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Spy x Family Headline Crunchyroll's Spring 2022 Season Where To Watch or Read Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie                  Anyone who is excited to dive into the story of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie doesn't have long to wait. The anime is due to begin airing in Japan on April 10, 2022, and will be available to stream on the Crunchyroll platform in the West. Meanwhile, interested fans can also try out the still-ongoing Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie manga, written and drawn by Keigo Maki. The series has amassed 11 volumes so far, and paperback copies can be found through Barnes & Noble's online catalog, Right Stuf Anime's website and Amazon's online catalog in the books department. As of this writing, the first eight volumes are available in English with Volume 9 releasing on April 5. Those who prefer digital manga can also find Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie on Amazon with the Kindle version, or through Barnes and Noble's catalog with the Nook version.

02-04-2022,anime,8,0,,Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: What to Know Before the Anime Begins,"   Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie: Everything to Know Before the Anime Starts The Spring 2022 anime season promises many great rom-com titles. Here's a preview for the highly-anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie.     By Louis Kemner Published 17 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 anime season will be filled with a colorful variety of new and returning series, from Season 2 of the isekai adventure The Rising of the Shield Hero to the return of the beloved Netflix hit Komi Can't Communicate. But Komi has some fresh new competition this season, including the highly anticipated Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This brand new series features a small but lovable cast of main characters, most of whom are high school students living their ordinary lives. The charming heroine Shikimori, however, is anything but an ordinary student. She promises to be a shojo-style shonen heroine unlike any other when the story begins airing on Crunchyroll in April. Here's a brief preview of what to expect.  RELATED: The Most Anticipated New & Returning Rom-Com Anime of Spring 2022 The Premise Of Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie                  Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a fresh new slice-of-life romance/comedy anime, in a similar vein to popular series such as Komi Can't Communicate and the beloved Horimiya. Although Shikimori isn't about to redefine the possibilities of high school or slice-of-life anime, the series should appeal to any fan who can't get enough of the genre while also looking for assertive, strong female leads who can carry an entire series on their own. More and more anime today are giving girls a chance to shine as the protagonist in a variety of genres, from Komi Shoko to Love of Kill's seinen-style shojo heroine Chateau Dankworth. It's a trend that is absolutely worth continuing in the spring season with Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. This anime stars the shonen heroine Shikimori, a lively pink-haired student who is definitely the more assertive and dynamic member of her relationship with the meek but kind Izumi. During their idyllic high school days together, Shikimori will take the lead as the attention-grabbing star who can do it all, from competitive sports in gym class to being an everyday hero who can rescue her boyfriend from harm when things go wrong -- and she's an ace student to boot. Shikimori is also known for giving off harsh glares that can make anyone back off and not want to mess with her. Meanwhile, her boyfriend Izumi mainly just follows her lead, but over time he may grow more assertive as well and make something of himself. RELATED: Rising of the Shield Hero and Spy x Family Headline Crunchyroll's Spring 2022 Season Where To Watch or Read Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie                  Anyone who is excited to dive into the story of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie doesn't have long to wait. The anime is due to begin airing in Japan on April 10, 2022, and will be available to stream on the Crunchyroll platform in the West. Meanwhile, interested fans can also try out the still-ongoing Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie manga, written and drawn by Keigo Maki. The series has amassed 11 volumes so far, and paperback copies can be found through Barnes & Noble's online catalog, Right Stuf Anime's website and Amazon's online catalog in the books department. As of this writing, the first eight volumes are available in English with Volume 9 releasing on April 5. Those who prefer digital manga can also find Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie on Amazon with the Kindle version, or through Barnes and Noble's catalog with the Nook version.

By Christian Markle Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Season 1 of Ranking of Kings, now streaming on Funimation. Ranking of Kings has concluded its first season after airing 23 episodes. The anime follows the story of Prince Bojji, a weak and deaf prince who couldn't hurt a fly, as he gets entangled in the middle of a nasty power struggle following his father's death. The anime started strong by throwing one plot twist after another and efficiently expounding on its characters and their motivations, and the series proves that there are no completely bad or absolutely good characters -- only characters motivated by their personal goals.  The final episode of Season 1 elicited a variety of reactions from its viewers. The episode focuses on the redemption of the anime's main antagonist, Miranjo. With her ending up as Daida's soon-to-be wife, Bosse Kingdom's biggest threat has come to pass. However, the anime's first season also leaves a lot of questions. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: Bojji's First Big Battle Is Truly Heartwarming Where Are Bojji And Kage Headed Now?                  By defeating his father, Bojji saves his kingdom from peril. However, he remains the vanquished prince, as Prince Daida is still Bosse Kingdom's crowned king. The problem quickly solves itself when Daida voluntarily renounces the throne to its rightful owner. Witnessing Bojji's incredible fight against King Bosse easily convinces Bosse's strongest subordinates to submit to Bojji. Belonging to the Shadow Clan, Kage leaves Bojji, believing that he has no right to stay by the prince's side. Bojji relinquishes his crown, with Queen Hiling's support, and searches for his friend. When the beloved pair met, Bojji declares that he will start his own kingdom, just as his father once did. With Bojji's strength, there is little that can pose a threat to them. However, power alone cannot build a kingdom. The two can follow in Bosse's footsteps and slowly build a following by helping others. With Bojji's pure heart, this is the most likely scenario. The other option is to go to the Underworld and start there. Bojji and Kage already have an established connection in the Underworld, and it's likely that they are already known by its denizens. They may find it easier to recruit the citizens of the Underworld, especially since Bojji possesses near-unparalleled fighting prowess. RELATED: Blue Period Season 1's Biggest Unanswered Questions What Will Happen To Bosse Kingdom?                  Despite relinquishing the throne to Bojji, Daida is once again crowned as Bosse Kingdom's ruler when his brother decides to continue his adventures. This time, however, no more dangers are threatening the kingdom. Miranjo's troubled past and her problems have already been resolved, with Daida accepting her for who she is and taking her as his wife. Miranjo's cunning and intellect and Bosse's four trustworthy warriors remaining in the kingdom should be able to defend it from most dangers. This raises the question of what will happen to the Bosse Kingdom next. Will it fade out of the series and live happily ever after -- or will it be attacked by the Gods once they learn of Miranjo's situation, forcing Bojji to defend it? RELATED: Who Is Tokyo Revengers' Most Powerful Fighter & What Makes Him So Strong? What Is King Desha's Reward For Being The No. 1 King?                  The last episodes of Ranking of Kings revealed that Desha and Despa planned to save their brother by asking the devil to relinquish his immortality. However, Daida sabotages that plan by asking for Miranjo's revival instead. When Despa reports this unforeseen turn of events to his brother, Desha is surprisingly nonchalant about it. The next scene then shows him accepting the rewards for being No. 1 in the Ranking of Kings. Desha accepting the reward right after hearing Despa's report hints that it may be a key to saving their brother Ouken. However, the anime has also disclosed that all previous kings who held that title somehow chose the same reward and have either gone mad or missing. The question now is this: what exactly is the reward and what is Desha planning to do with it?

02-04-2022,anime,5,0,,Ranking of Kings' Biggest Unanswered Questions After Season 1,"   Ranking of Kings' Biggest Questions After the Season 1 Finale The first season of the fairytale-like anime Ranking of Kings has recently concluded, and it leaves fans with a bunch of questions.     By Christian Markle Published 5 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Season 1 of Ranking of Kings, now streaming on Funimation. Ranking of Kings has concluded its first season after airing 23 episodes. The anime follows the story of Prince Bojji, a weak and deaf prince who couldn't hurt a fly, as he gets entangled in the middle of a nasty power struggle following his father's death. The anime started strong by throwing one plot twist after another and efficiently expounding on its characters and their motivations, and the series proves that there are no completely bad or absolutely good characters -- only characters motivated by their personal goals.  The final episode of Season 1 elicited a variety of reactions from its viewers. The episode focuses on the redemption of the anime's main antagonist, Miranjo. With her ending up as Daida's soon-to-be wife, Bosse Kingdom's biggest threat has come to pass. However, the anime's first season also leaves a lot of questions. RELATED: Ranking of Kings: Bojji's First Big Battle Is Truly Heartwarming Where Are Bojji And Kage Headed Now?                  By defeating his father, Bojji saves his kingdom from peril. However, he remains the vanquished prince, as Prince Daida is still Bosse Kingdom's crowned king. The problem quickly solves itself when Daida voluntarily renounces the throne to its rightful owner. Witnessing Bojji's incredible fight against King Bosse easily convinces Bosse's strongest subordinates to submit to Bojji. Belonging to the Shadow Clan, Kage leaves Bojji, believing that he has no right to stay by the prince's side. Bojji relinquishes his crown, with Queen Hiling's support, and searches for his friend. When the beloved pair met, Bojji declares that he will start his own kingdom, just as his father once did. With Bojji's strength, there is little that can pose a threat to them. However, power alone cannot build a kingdom. The two can follow in Bosse's footsteps and slowly build a following by helping others. With Bojji's pure heart, this is the most likely scenario. The other option is to go to the Underworld and start there. Bojji and Kage already have an established connection in the Underworld, and it's likely that they are already known by its denizens. They may find it easier to recruit the citizens of the Underworld, especially since Bojji possesses near-unparalleled fighting prowess. RELATED: Blue Period Season 1's Biggest Unanswered Questions What Will Happen To Bosse Kingdom?                  Despite relinquishing the throne to Bojji, Daida is once again crowned as Bosse Kingdom's ruler when his brother decides to continue his adventures. This time, however, no more dangers are threatening the kingdom. Miranjo's troubled past and her problems have already been resolved, with Daida accepting her for who she is and taking her as his wife. Miranjo's cunning and intellect and Bosse's four trustworthy warriors remaining in the kingdom should be able to defend it from most dangers. This raises the question of what will happen to the Bosse Kingdom next. Will it fade out of the series and live happily ever after -- or will it be attacked by the Gods once they learn of Miranjo's situation, forcing Bojji to defend it? RELATED: Who Is Tokyo Revengers' Most Powerful Fighter & What Makes Him So Strong? What Is King Desha's Reward For Being The No. 1 King?                  The last episodes of Ranking of Kings revealed that Desha and Despa planned to save their brother by asking the devil to relinquish his immortality. However, Daida sabotages that plan by asking for Miranjo's revival instead. When Despa reports this unforeseen turn of events to his brother, Desha is surprisingly nonchalant about it. The next scene then shows him accepting the rewards for being No. 1 in the Ranking of Kings. Desha accepting the reward right after hearing Despa's report hints that it may be a key to saving their brother Ouken. However, the anime has also disclosed that all previous kings who held that title somehow chose the same reward and have either gone mad or missing. The question now is this: what exactly is the reward and what is Desha planning to do with it?

By Nerissa Rupnarine Published 2 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    With both a successful anime and manga, the josei series Chihayafuru has sustained a cult following by offering compelling drama and intense sports matches focusing heavily on the Japanese card game of karuta. However, despite being predominantly a sports anime, there have been hints at potential romances throughout the story, with a love triangle forming between the three main characters of Chihaya Ayase, Taichi Mashima and Arata Wataya. Taichi harbors a one-sided crush on the currently oblivious Chihaya, while Chihaya seems to harbor feelings of deep admiration -- possibly more -- for their long-distant friend Arata. While being part of the main storyline from the beginning and a key form of entertainment for some fans, Chihayafuru has so much going for it that the series would be just fine even if there are never any full-blown romantic relationships.  Related: Chihayafuru Announces Manga's Final Volume                  Written and illustrated by Yuki Suetsugu, Chihayafuru began publication in December 2007. A total of 48 volumes have been released so far, with the series set to end with the release of Volume 49. An anime adaptation produced by Madhouse Studios has garnered three seasons and 74 episodes. Both the anime and manga have been met with high praise from fans and critics alike. Putting the romantic tension aside, the three main characters each manage to be complex and entertaining all on their own. Chihaya, while naturally having great reflexes and impeccable hearing -- traits well-suited to playing karuta -- is still growing into her own. She aims to be Queen -- a title awarded to the best female karuta player in Japan -- and she chases this dream with an admirable level of passion, so much so that karuta becomes the focal point of her world. Chihaya dedicates so much love and hard work to the game that her wins are satisfying and her losses difficult to watch, to the point where fans can't help but root for her. Despite excelling both academically and in sports, Taichi is not naturally gifted and works extremely hard to attain perfection due to the high expectations placed upon him by his strict mother. As such, he struggles to learn karuta, although is encouraged by the joy he finds in the game through playing with his friends, Chihaya and Arata. While he first became interested in the game because of Chihaya, over time, he has genuinely come to love it. Arata introduced Karuta to both Chihaya and Taichi. He is hailed as a prodigy in this field and was taught the game by his grandfather, Hajime Wataya, a renowned master in the karuta world. Arata was close with his grandfather, but when he passed away due to illness, Arata began carrying the weight of his grandfather's death on his shoulders. Devastated and grief-stricken, he quit playing karuta. Related: Josei Is Anime & Manga's Most Underrated Demographic                  While the love triangle certainly adds to the drama, the platonic interrelations are just as fascinating. Meeting as children, the friendships between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata are forged and intertwined by karuta. The trio loses contact before junior high school, each falling out of karuta for different reasons. It isn't until high school that Chihaya and Taichi reunite. Eager to play karuta again, she convinces Taichi to start a karuta club with her where they recruit members, introducing their love of the game to newcomers and establishing their own friend group who now all share a common interest. However, while these new friends are great encouragement for climbing up in the tanks, no one motivates Chihaya or Taichi to play to the best of their abilities more than Arata. Although the third main character, Arata is absent throughout most of the story. Rather, it's his memory and distant presence that pushes Chihaya and Taichi considerably, as his karuta skills have always surpassed those of his friends. This makes his limited appearances extremely gratifying, which is only exemplified with silent reminiscences of the strong bond the trio once shared when they were kids before the hardships of life caught up to them. Childhood friends and rivals, they are each on their own journey, attempting to carve out their individual paths as they fight to achieve their dreams. Additionally, while karuta may seem like a trivial, uninteresting card game, like every other sports anime, Chihayafuru uses its characters, story, visuals and soundtrack to amplify the karuta experience. There's never a dull moment, with every match providing plenty of drama and intensity. One of the most standout elements of the anime is the stunning visuals, which are used creatively and silently to showcase the various complicated emotions of the characters. The audience is brought into their world through a poetic lens that mimics the poetry found in karuta. So does the story really need romance? Not really. Chihaya is mostly obsessed with karuta, and has little interest in pursuing a romantic relationship, while Taichi and Arata also strive to be the best they can be. Romance is definitely a side venture, but karuta remains the main focus. Matches are engaging in their own right, and there's a full cast of well-developed characters who further flesh out the story. Whether Chihaya ends up with someone or not, Chihayafuru successfully manages to tell a beautifully conceptualized story about the realities of chasing a dream that's sure to tug at heartstrings.

By Michael Lacerna Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    A massive new Fullmetal Alchemist statue has been unveiled, but it might be one of the costliest exchanges in the series' history. Good Smile Company is now taking preorders on its new Edward and Alphonse Elric statue. The massive statue is 16 inches tall and 17 inches wide, and depicts the brothers in battle as Ed transmutes his automail arm into a dagger and Al transforms the ground to give his older sibling a boost. True to the series' law of equivalent exchange, the highly detailed and sizable figure comes with an equally hefty price tag: $2,199.99 USD. The preorder window for the statue will close on May 11, though hardcore fans will want to scrounge together the funds quickly, however, as Good Smile warns only a limited number of the statues will be produced and the preorder window may close early if orders meet the production limit.  RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist Handles Politics Better Than Attack on Titan                                                       In order to illustrate just how large the new, non-scale statue is, Good Smile Company released an image that compares the figure to one of the company's Fullmetal Alchemist Nendoroid figures, which usually stand between 3-4 inches tall. Fullmetal Alchemist was created by celebrated manga author and artist Hiromu Arakawa in 2001. The series was one of the most popular manga series of the early '00s, achieving a global circulation of over 80 million copies. The series tells the story of two brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use their natural talent in alchemy -- the ability to transform one object into another -- to try to resurrect their beloved mother after she suddenly passes away. The attempt goes horribly awry and costs Ed an arm and a leg, while Al loses his entire body and is only able to survive by having his soul anchored to an old suit of armor. Devastated by their losses, the two brothers join their country's military force, where they work as State Alchemists as they try to find a legendary artifact that will let them undo their biggest mistake. RELATED: Fullmetal Alchemist's Promised Day Arrives in Action-Packed Live Action Trailer Arakawa's critically acclaimed manga received two anime adaptations: the first was produced in 2003, before the manga was completed, and consequently features a substantially different story line and ending. A second anime, entitled Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, premiered in 2009. The second series was a much more faithful rendition of Arakawa's original work and is now generally regarded as the superior adaptation. The series has also been adapted into a series of live-action movies, the first of which was released in 2017. The second and third entries in the trilogy are scheduled to be released in Japan later this year. Both anime series are now available for streaming on Hulu and Crunchyroll, while the manga is available in English from VIZ Media and Yen Press.

Another character is helping her friends from the distance in the latest Attack on Titan episode.     By Christian Markle Published 6 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4, Episode 27, ""Retrospective,"" now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The death of Sasha Braus hurt not only the fans but also her regiment, since she is one of the best snipers of the Survey Corps and Attack on Titan in general. The latest episode of the anime unveiled the Survey Corps' new ally to be as efficient as the late potato lover when it comes to sharpshooting. While she may not replace the group's beloved friends, her skills prove to be a great asset for the success of Hange's small resistance group. Sasha proved her superior aiming skills multiple times. The most noteworthy of which was when she covered for the Survey Corps members during their raid on Liberio. Perhaps the biggest mistake she committed back then was not eliminating the young Gabi, who ended up being her murderer. Now, Gabi is taking on Sasha's role.  RELATED: Attack on Titan Marks the Return of the Anime's Earliest Antagonist                     Even though Gabi was initially a loyal Marleyan supremacist, she turned over a new leaf after learning the truth about Paradis Island from Sasha's very own family. Eren's sinister plan solidified her resolve to fight and save her hometown. She owned up her mistakes and begged the furious Jean for his help to stop Eren. During Armin and Connie's attempt to trick Floch and the Jaegerists into peacefully giving them Azumiboto's flying boat, Floch took notice of their plan and declared them as traitors. Floch ordered the destruction of the boat, which resulted in a bloodbath. After Connie murdered Daz and Samuel and no other Jaegerist could blow the ship, Floch took the matter to his own hand. However, Gabi was able to shoot him down, resulting in Floch's thunder spear barely missing the ship. While this impressive feat greatly helped the resistance, it wasn't just a lucky shot. Even before the Survey Corps attacked Liberio, Gabi was already shown as a dependable warrior. In fact, she was able to singlehandedly take out an armored train during her debut. Floch was also not the first victim of Gabi's sharpshooting. As most fans know and hate, Gabi took Sasha's life with a single shot. She was also able to snipe Eren, resulting in the latter's beheading, as they attempt to prevent the brothers from making contact. RELATED: Attack on Titan: Falco Debuts the New Jaw Titan - and It's a Game-Changer                  Gabi taking up Sasha's role is also not an unprecedented event. Sasha's most epic moment was when she saved the young Kaya from a Titan with only a wooden bow and arrows. She bravely jumped into the Titan's head and sunk an arrow into its eye, giving them a window to escape. During Zeke's mass Titanification, Kaya found herself in a similar situation. That time, however, it wasn't her big sister Sasha who saved her. It was Gabi, who she briefly saw as Sasha. That brief moment of resemblance may have been a foreshadowing of the young girl assuming her victim's role. Gabi may have been -- and probably still is -- one of the most hated characters in Attack on Titan, but she has been redeeming herself bit by bit in the latest episodes of the anime. With her covering the members of the resistance from a good distance, the Eren-killing group may be able to move more freely, albeit only slightly.

By Timothy Donohoo Published 3 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Neon Genesis Evangelion was a landmark series for both the mecha anime genre as well as anime in general. A dark and psychological deconstruction of the genre, the show completely upended everything about mecha shows while dripping with subtext. Of course, this success saw many imitators try to emulate the formula, although one of these supposed copies get an unfair reputation because of it. RahXephon is seen by many as merely an Evangelion wannabe, but the series is so much more. Although the two certainly share some similar themes and concepts, they handle them in vastly different ways, all while being far different from each other than many realize. There are even elements that RahXephon does better than its supposed ""inspiration,"" making its criticisms more than premature.  RELATED: How Gundam Creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's ""Aura Battler Dunbine"" Influenced Isekai What Is RahXephon?                  RahXephon is set in a world where Japan has been ravaged by interdimensional invaders known as Mulians, or Mu. These creatures, almost indistinguishable from humans beyond their blue blood, pilot powerful clay ""Dolems"" in order to take over and encapsulate Tokyo. Encasing it in a ring barrier, the Mu are warred against by humanity, namely the defense research agency TERRA. The protagonist is Ayato Kamina, a seemingly normal young man who becomes entangled with TERRA and comes to pilot the mysterious ""RahXephon"" weapon against the Dolems. While it's considered a mecha or robot, it, like the Dolems themselves, is made out of clay. In the ensuing battles against the invaders, Kamina learns more about himself as well as his old friend Haruka, whose history together Kamina had come to forget. The result is as much of a love story as it is a mecha series, although there are definitely intentional influences from old-school Super Robot anime of the 1970s. However, a much more contemporary fellow mecha is what many assume was the real inspiration. Why RahXephon Isn't Just an Evangelion Ripoff                  Many critics of RahXephon have noted the similarities between it and Evangelion, and these comparisons are not unfounded. Both have a young man being forced to pilot a robot that may or may not represent his mother at the behest of a secret organization, all while he has strange sexual tension with another mother figure. That's not to mention the swathes of subtext, symbolism and similarly unorthodox designs of the Dolems and the Angels in Evangelion. While this is all fair, it's what RahXephon does with these themes that helps differentiate it from the real Evangelion ripoffs. RELATED: Gundam’s Iron-Blooded Orphans Spinoff Trailer Introduces a Slew of New Characters and Mecha Whereas Evangelion tends to have tons of arguably irrelevant religious iconography, RahXephon's symbolism feels much more natural and organic to its themes. Said themes typically involve music, arguably making it closer to fellow mecha show Eureka Seven. Ironically, despite all the religious symbolism in Evangelion, it's RahXephon that actually directly addresses anything religious. For instance, one episode takes place during Christmas, and the non-Christian TERRA crew discuss what such a holiday means to them. While it could be argued by some that the show is ""dumber"" for talking about these concepts, it helps to make all of its symbolism much more than just cool Easter Eggs. Likewise, the use of topics such as ancient civilizations feels like a fittingly intentional throwback to classic shows such as Godmars. Another element that RahXephon does better than Evangelion is its protagonist. While he has his groan-worthy moments, Kamina is much more proactive and less whiny than Shinji Ikari, which also helps to make the plot move along better. Although some of the side characters in RahXephon aren't quite as strong as Asuka or Rei, the main character, and arguably the Misato stand-in as well, are much more enjoyable characters. This all comes together to make a show that's sadly too covered in by the shadow of Evangelion, when in reality, it's more of a celebration of the mecha genre than the former ever was.

By Marc York Published Mar 26, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Masashi Kishimoto has gone o record to say that among the Naruto main cast, Sasuke Uchiha is his favorite character. That's easy enough to see by looking at the Naruto narrative; he goes from a basic rival character to the deuteragonist of the series; his abilities and lineage both become key plot points; several story arcs in Part II are devoted to him. If Sasuke wasn't Kishimoto Sensei's favorite, he'd have to at least be close to it. What's really difficult to imagine, however, is why Sasuke is his favorite character. For all the reasons there are to like a character, this is something only he and a select few fans can truly understand. It doesn't have to do with his personality or anything he does in the story. Getting to the bottom of this will require a look at Sasuke's creation and conception.  RELATED: How Tall Are the Naruto Characters?                  The funny thing is that Kishimoto Sensei never even considered having Sasuke in his story at first. His editor was the one who convinced him to give Naruto a rival. If Kishimoto never even wanted Sasuke in his story to begin with, then that only adds to the mystery of what changed. Not only did Kishimoto Sensei not have Sasuke in mind when conceiving Naruto, but he had a difficult time just drawing the character. His original design for Sasuke featured several necklaces and ties around his arms and legs. He had to scrap this design because he couldn't draw it on a weekly basis; he instead went with a more streamlined look that would contrast Naruto's outfit. Kishimoto Sensei would try again to give Sasuke a cool design during the Chūnin Exams. He gave the boy several belts around his left arm and bands around both his legs. Unfortunately, like Sasuke's beta design, it was unsustainable, so Kishimoto Sensei eventually switched him back to his old design. RELATED: Naruto: Why Was Hayate Gekkō Always Coughing During the Chunin Exams? Kishimoto Sensei couldn't even get Sasuke's face right at first. He needed to make the boy look like a kid in Part I, but he would always make him look older than he really was. It would take him some time to settle on some relatively boyish features and stick with them, and even then he struggled to maintain them in his art. He probably felt so relieved after making everyone into teenagers for Part II. For all the difficulty drawing Sasuke gives Kishimoto Sensei, one would think that he'd be the mangaka's least favorite character. However, he calls Sasuke his favorite precisely because he gets so much enjoyment out of drawing him. He likes coming up with cool new designs for a cool character. It may sound tedious, but, for a true artist, it's a lot of fun. RELATED: The Real Reason Naruto's Shinobi Ended Up Wearing Headbands                  This would certainly explain Sasuke's design changes so often throughout Part II. Not only that, but his hair gets a little longer, which also means he takes a little longer to draw. Even Naruto only gets an occasional outfit change, which always inevitably reverts back to his standard wear. Sasuke, on the other hand, is ever-changing and never goes back to an old look. Not only is it obvious how much Kishimoto Sensei loves Sasuke, but it's also clear how much he loves drawing him. As difficult as it can be, there's a pleasure to be had from dressing up characters in new clothes every once in a while. It's a feeling that can be understood well, especially among fellow artists. Kishimoto's passion for designing and redesigning Sasuke is indicative of his passion as an artist. KEEP READING: Where Did Naruto's Strong Love of Ramen Come From?

02-04-2022,anime,3,0,,Masashi Kishimoto's Favorite Naruto Character Isn't a Surprise – But His Reason Is,"   Masashi Kishimoto's Favorite Naruto Character Isn't a Surprise – But His Reason Is Kishimoto's favoritism is clear, but his reasons aren't something just any fan would think of when discussing what they like about a character.     By Marc York Published Mar 26, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Masashi Kishimoto has gone o record to say that among the Naruto main cast, Sasuke Uchiha is his favorite character. That's easy enough to see by looking at the Naruto narrative; he goes from a basic rival character to the deuteragonist of the series; his abilities and lineage both become key plot points; several story arcs in Part II are devoted to him. If Sasuke wasn't Kishimoto Sensei's favorite, he'd have to at least be close to it. What's really difficult to imagine, however, is why Sasuke is his favorite character. For all the reasons there are to like a character, this is something only he and a select few fans can truly understand. It doesn't have to do with his personality or anything he does in the story. Getting to the bottom of this will require a look at Sasuke's creation and conception.  RELATED: How Tall Are the Naruto Characters?                  The funny thing is that Kishimoto Sensei never even considered having Sasuke in his story at first. His editor was the one who convinced him to give Naruto a rival. If Kishimoto never even wanted Sasuke in his story to begin with, then that only adds to the mystery of what changed. Not only did Kishimoto Sensei not have Sasuke in mind when conceiving Naruto, but he had a difficult time just drawing the character. His original design for Sasuke featured several necklaces and ties around his arms and legs. He had to scrap this design because he couldn't draw it on a weekly basis; he instead went with a more streamlined look that would contrast Naruto's outfit. Kishimoto Sensei would try again to give Sasuke a cool design during the Chūnin Exams. He gave the boy several belts around his left arm and bands around both his legs. Unfortunately, like Sasuke's beta design, it was unsustainable, so Kishimoto Sensei eventually switched him back to his old design. RELATED: Naruto: Why Was Hayate Gekkō Always Coughing During the Chunin Exams? Kishimoto Sensei couldn't even get Sasuke's face right at first. He needed to make the boy look like a kid in Part I, but he would always make him look older than he really was. It would take him some time to settle on some relatively boyish features and stick with them, and even then he struggled to maintain them in his art. He probably felt so relieved after making everyone into teenagers for Part II. For all the difficulty drawing Sasuke gives Kishimoto Sensei, one would think that he'd be the mangaka's least favorite character. However, he calls Sasuke his favorite precisely because he gets so much enjoyment out of drawing him. He likes coming up with cool new designs for a cool character. It may sound tedious, but, for a true artist, it's a lot of fun. RELATED: The Real Reason Naruto's Shinobi Ended Up Wearing Headbands                  This would certainly explain Sasuke's design changes so often throughout Part II. Not only that, but his hair gets a little longer, which also means he takes a little longer to draw. Even Naruto only gets an occasional outfit change, which always inevitably reverts back to his standard wear. Sasuke, on the other hand, is ever-changing and never goes back to an old look. Not only is it obvious how much Kishimoto Sensei loves Sasuke, but it's also clear how much he loves drawing him. As difficult as it can be, there's a pleasure to be had from dressing up characters in new clothes every once in a while. It's a feeling that can be understood well, especially among fellow artists. Kishimoto's passion for designing and redesigning Sasuke is indicative of his passion as an artist. KEEP READING: Where Did Naruto's Strong Love of Ramen Come From?

Here's some of the best isekai where the main character goes home.     By Jessie Xu Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The isekai genre has exploded into popularity in recent years, leading to an oversaturation in new adaptations. The idea of the main character restarting life in a new and exciting world of fantasy is appealing to many viewers, and that demand has led to the subgenre developing its own set of tropes.  A popular trope within this subgenre is the process of the protagonist trying to find their way home. However, there are a rare few instances where they actually succeed in doing so. Here are some of the best isekai anime where the main character goes against all odds to return home. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept  Re:Creators Turns the Tables on Classic Isekai                  Starting off with an unconventional and refreshing take on the isekai genre is Re:Creators. This series challenges the conventional trope of the underdog reincarnating into a fantasy world; this time, it’s the characters from fictional worlds who are out of place in the real world. Its unique concept and clever use of the reverse isekai genre make it one of the best isekai where the main characters return home.  The Devil Is a Part-Timer! Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity. RELATED: How 'A Realist Hero' Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches  Sword Art Online: The Famous (Or Infamous) Isekai Classic                  Hailed as the series that catapulted isekai into popularity -- for better or for worse -- Sword Art Online has made a permanent mark in anime history. It would be a sin to not include this long-time classic. When a virtual reality game becomes a deathtrap for the millions of players logged on, there is only one thought pushing protagonists Kirito and Asuna forward: the hope of returning home. RELATED: How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Dog Days Is the Underdog of the Isekai Genre                  Dog Days may not be the best-known isekai among the wider anime community, but it is certainly unique. This story follows the adventures of Cinque Izumi and his friends when they are invited to represent different kingdoms on an alternate Earth. The inhabitants are human-like beings with animal characteristics who fight wars through sporting competitions.  This lighthearted adaptation takes a peaceful approach toward the age-old question about the main character’s home. Protagonists are able to easily cross between both worlds, eliminating the dilemma entirely. RELATED: The Best Isekai With OP Main Characters Inuyasha Is the Classic Shoujo Isekai Fantasy                  Inuyasha has long since cemented itself as a classic shoujo series within the anime community. It tells of a classic love story across worlds and time periods between Kagome, a girl tasked with saving the world, and Inuyasha, a hybrid dog demon/human tasked with protecting her -- all while weaving a tasteful combination of comedy and romance. At first Kagome is able to easily cross between both worlds, but ultimately she'll have to make a decision between the two. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons Digimon Adventure Is a Trip Down Memory Lane                  The Digimon franchise has become one of the best-known anime franchises geared toward children along with classics like Pokemon.

02-04-2022,anime,7,0,,Best Isekai Where the Main Character Returns Home,"   The Best Isekai in Which the Main Character Returns Home Who wouldn’t want to return home after being transmigrated into a different world? Here's some of the best isekai where the main character goes home.     By Jessie Xu Published 15 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The isekai genre has exploded into popularity in recent years, leading to an oversaturation in new adaptations. The idea of the main character restarting life in a new and exciting world of fantasy is appealing to many viewers, and that demand has led to the subgenre developing its own set of tropes.  A popular trope within this subgenre is the process of the protagonist trying to find their way home. However, there are a rare few instances where they actually succeed in doing so. Here are some of the best isekai anime where the main character goes against all odds to return home. RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept  Re:Creators Turns the Tables on Classic Isekai                  Starting off with an unconventional and refreshing take on the isekai genre is Re:Creators. This series challenges the conventional trope of the underdog reincarnating into a fantasy world; this time, it’s the characters from fictional worlds who are out of place in the real world. Its unique concept and clever use of the reverse isekai genre make it one of the best isekai where the main characters return home.  The Devil Is a Part-Timer! Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity. RELATED: How 'A Realist Hero' Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches  Sword Art Online: The Famous (Or Infamous) Isekai Classic                  Hailed as the series that catapulted isekai into popularity -- for better or for worse -- Sword Art Online has made a permanent mark in anime history. It would be a sin to not include this long-time classic. When a virtual reality game becomes a deathtrap for the millions of players logged on, there is only one thought pushing protagonists Kirito and Asuna forward: the hope of returning home. RELATED: How Sword Art Online: Progressive Differs From the Original Light Novels Dog Days Is the Underdog of the Isekai Genre                  Dog Days may not be the best-known isekai among the wider anime community, but it is certainly unique. This story follows the adventures of Cinque Izumi and his friends when they are invited to represent different kingdoms on an alternate Earth. The inhabitants are human-like beings with animal characteristics who fight wars through sporting competitions.  This lighthearted adaptation takes a peaceful approach toward the age-old question about the main character’s home. Protagonists are able to easily cross between both worlds, eliminating the dilemma entirely. RELATED: The Best Isekai With OP Main Characters Inuyasha Is the Classic Shoujo Isekai Fantasy                  Inuyasha has long since cemented itself as a classic shoujo series within the anime community. It tells of a classic love story across worlds and time periods between Kagome, a girl tasked with saving the world, and Inuyasha, a hybrid dog demon/human tasked with protecting her -- all while weaving a tasteful combination of comedy and romance. At first Kagome is able to easily cross between both worlds, but ultimately she'll have to make a decision between the two. RELATED: Yashahime Tackles the Morality of Humans and Demons Digimon Adventure Is a Trip Down Memory Lane                  The Digimon franchise has become one of the best-known anime franchises geared toward children along with classics like Pokemon. Taichi Yagami and his friends are suddenly transported to a ‘Digital World’ while at summer camp. Follow their exciting adventures as they journey to find their way home alongside strange creatures known as Digimon.

Here's why the comedy series Spy x Family is good.     By Marla Añonuevo Published 7 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    The Spring 2022 season is coming, and one of the highly anticipated shows is Tatsuya Endo’s action-comedy manga series, Spy x Family. It is under Shonen Jump, but the series steers away from elements usually found in many of the titles under this magazine. Spy x Family offers a refreshing new take on stories targeted for shonen. Numerous factors make the show appealing, but the premise will hook potential fans in immediately. Spy x Family revolves around the Forgers -- a pretend family with their own secret identities, which they are unaware of. A spy who goes by the name Twilight assumes the fatherly role of Loid Forger, a psychiatrist. Anya, the child, is a telepath. Meanwhile, the mother, Yor, is an assassin known as the Thorn Princess. Even though secrecy is a significant theme within the family (and the story), these members seem to be a perfect match for each other.  RELATED: Shonen Jump’s Spy X Family: Plot, Characters & How to Get Started                  The story begins with Twilight, a master of disguise. He’s a top agent of the Westalis’ Intelligence Services’ Eastern-Focused Division (WISE), an organization whose goal is to keep the peace between the countries Westalis and Ostania. Twilight's latest mission, Operation Strix, requires him to get married and have a family within a week. While it may seem like an impossible feat to obtain a wife and a child within mere days, he pulls through. He adopts Anya from an orphanage, and shortly after, he and Yor impulsively decide to get married while being chased by enemies. If that alone is not enticing enough, it gets better. Each member has their respective agenda and motivations for wanting to maintain the fake family. Twilight needs this to get close to his target. Yor needs the sham marriage to keep her assassin gig and conform better to societal standards. Meanwhile, Anya thought it would be exciting to have a spy and an assassin as parents. Funnily enough, Anya is the only one who generally knows what's truly going on -- but of course, her understanding of it is limited since she's a young child. With that, there are instances where Anya acts accordingly for the sake of the mission. However, it almost always never goes smoothly. This usually results in some of the many hilarious moments in the story. RELATED: Meet the Forgers in the Latest Spy x Family Anime Trailer                   Aside from the Forgers, Spy x Family has an equally interesting ensemble of supporting characters. Yor’s younger brother, Yuri, works for the State Security Service (which is basically WISE’s enemy). To keep with the theme of “secrets” in the story, Yor is unaware of Yuri’s actual occupation and thinks he’s a civil servant. He disapproves of Yor and Loid since he's incredibly attached to his sister. Henry Henderson, a teacher at Eden Academy, has a striking first impression. He embodies the word ""exaggeration"" in his character introduction, which is ironically funny considering how people at the prestigious Eden Academy are expected to be prim and proper. Considering some of the subject matter, certain aspects of Spy x Family might give off a serious tone -- but overall, the story is light and entertaining. A dysfunctional family involving a spy, an assassin, and a telepath is pretty much a killer recipe for a chaotic dynamic. This may be fairly troublesome, especially knowing that world peace more or less lies within the hands of the Forgers. Their struggles as a group and how their secret identities affect the mission show us (in various ways) that maintaining and raising a family is indeed one of the world's most challenging tasks.

A dysfunctional family involving a spy, an assassin, and a telepath is pretty much a killer recipe for a chaotic dynamic. This may be fairly troublesome, especially knowing that world peace more or less lies within the hands of the Forgers. Their struggles as a group and how their secret identities affect the mission show us (in various ways) that maintaining and raising a family is indeed one of the world's most challenging tasks.

The joke is tucked away in Wikipedia's Did You Know section for April 1. In between joke facts about The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, the page states ""Did you know that a common way to travel to another world is to be hit by a truck?"" The bullet point links out to the Wikipedia entries for the isekai genre and the Truck-kun meme that it spawned. A screencap of the section is provided below. RELATED: How ‘A Realist Hero’ Struggles Against Isekai Fantasy Cliches                   ""Isekai,"" a term roughly translated to ""other world,"" refers to a genre of story that involves the protagonist, who is usually from the real world, being transported into a fantasy or sci-fi world that is substantially different from our own. While stories using this setup have existed for sometime, the genre has exploded in popularity in Japan within the last decade, with the most popular examples being Sword Art Online, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, So I'm a Spider So What and KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World.   Notably, many of the genre's protagonists, including the heroes of Mushoku Tensei and Didn't I Say To Make My Abilities Average In The Next Life?!, find themselves transported to their new worlds after being struck and killed by an oncoming truck, usually while pushing somebody else out of the way. The trope has become so ubiquitous that it spawned the Truck-kun meme, which posits that the truck is a reoccurring anime character that possesses one of the highest body counts in the history of the medium. The cliche was lampooned in the set-up for one of the genre's most popular series, KonoSuba, in which the hero initially believes he died saving a beautiful girl from an oncoming truck, but is later told that the vehicle was actually a slow-moving tractor that the girl easily avoided, and that his actual cause of death was the stress caused by his overreaction to the situation. The joke has even spawned its own parody manga, Isekai Transporter, which casts the truck as a noble figure that heroically sends young people to be reincarnated into the worlds that need them most.

The new previews suggest that Ash, Goh and Chloe will get closer to achieving their Pokémon-related goals in the series' next arc. Ash is shown reuniting with his beloved Greninja and continuing to hone his skills in preparation for his eventual showdown with the champion of the World Coronation Series, Leon, while Goh encounters the legendary Pokémon Suicune, and Chloe participates in a Pokémon contest with her still un-evolved Evee. A new poster also teases an encounter with Mew, the rare Pokémon that Goh wants to capture most of all.

Similar to the streaming company's release schedule to the new season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, new episodes of the show are being released intermittently in batches. The last group of new episodes premiered in January; Netflix has yet to announce when it will release further chapters of the show internationally. The Pokémon anime is currently celebrating the 25th anniversary of its original premiere. The first episode of the series first debuted on April 1, 1997, a little more than a year after Game Freak and Nintendo released Pocket Monsters: Red and Green Version for the original black-and-white Game Boy in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. While a year separated the premiere of the anime from the release of the original games in Japan, the TV show premiered in North America just a month after Nintendo released the original games, now localized under the title Pokémon Red and Blue Versions, in 1998. RELATED: Pokémon TCG Online Is a Great Way for New Players to Learn the Basics The celebration of the anime's big anniversary comes after The Pokémon Company wrapped up its year-long celebration 25th anniversary of the video game series. Nintendo and Game Freak released numerous new titles in the series throughout 2021, including Pokémon Unite, a free-to-play MOBA-style competitive game and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, a 3D remake of the main series' original pair of DS games. The Pokémon Company recently showed off the future of the series in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which will kick off the series' ninth generation of games. The Pokémon anime has always tried to tie itself in with the latest releases in the video game series, so its possible that Master Journeys'  anniversary-inspired adventures through past regions may soon end as Ash and Pikachu move on to the latest games' Spain-inspired region. Scarlet and Violet are currently scheduled to be released for the Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

By Michael Lacerna Published 23 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Pokémon Master Journeys released a new trailer and key visual for the series' next batch of episodes. The new previews suggest that Ash, Goh and Chloe will get closer to achieving their Pokémon-related goals in the series' next arc. Ash is shown reuniting with his beloved Greninja and continuing to hone his skills in preparation for his eventual showdown with the champion of the World Coronation Series, Leon, while Goh encounters the legendary Pokémon Suicune, and Chloe participates in a Pokémon contest with her still un-evolved Evee. A new poster also teases an encounter with Mew, the rare Pokémon that Goh wants to capture most of all.

Similar to the streaming company's release schedule to the new season of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, new episodes of the show are being released intermittently in batches. The last group of new episodes premiered in January; Netflix has yet to announce when it will release further chapters of the show internationally. The Pokémon anime is currently celebrating the 25th anniversary of its original premiere. The first episode of the series first debuted on April 1, 1997, a little more than a year after Game Freak and Nintendo released Pocket Monsters: Red and Green Version for the original black-and-white Game Boy in Japan on Feb. 27, 1996. While a year separated the premiere of the anime from the release of the original games in Japan, the TV show premiered in North America just a month after Nintendo released the original games, now localized under the title Pokémon Red and Blue Versions, in 1998. RELATED: Pokémon TCG Online Is a Great Way for New Players to Learn the Basics The celebration of the anime's big anniversary comes after The Pokémon Company wrapped up its year-long celebration 25th anniversary of the video game series. Nintendo and Game Freak released numerous new titles in the series throughout 2021, including Pokémon Unite, a free-to-play MOBA-style competitive game and Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, a 3D remake of the main series' original pair of DS games. The Pokémon Company recently showed off the future of the series in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which will kick off the series' ninth generation of games. The Pokémon anime has always tried to tie itself in with the latest releases in the video game series, so its possible that Master Journeys'  anniversary-inspired adventures through past regions may soon end as Ash and Pikachu move on to the latest games' Spain-inspired region. Scarlet and Violet are currently scheduled to be released for the Nintendo Switch sometime before the end of 2022.

By Marc York Published 20 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Releasing May 16 on Netflix, the original fantasy anime series Vampire in the Garden is set in a world plagued by war between humans and vampires. There, the human Momo and the vampire Fiine begin a journey in search of Paradise. The series promises to be action-packed, emotional and dramatic, but there's something else about Vampire in the Garden that has caught people's attention: Judging by the trailer, the characters vaguely resemble those of Naruto. Sure enough, Naruto and Vampire in the Garden have been worked on by Tetsuya Nishio. He's just one of the many big names in the anime industry listed as staff members for this upcoming series. There's also the studio to consider. To elaborate, here's a closer look at everyone that Vampire in the Garden is proud to call a part of its production.  RELATED: How Tall Are the Naruto Characters?     The first name to pop up in the trailer is Wit Studio. They're well known for the first three seasons of Attack on Titan. They also animated action series like Seraph of the End (another human vs vampire anime), Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, and Vinland Saga. Other popular works of theirs include The Ancient Magus Bride, After the Rain, and Ranking of Kings. Many of Wit Studio’s anime have gone on to receive critical acclaim, which is a good sign for Vampire in the Garden. If Vampire in the Garden is like any of Wit's other series, then it should have a good balance between dynamic action sequences and engaging drama. The action presented in the trailer certainly lives up to its studio's name. The characters give good and emotional performances, but the drama will depend on how well the story builds up to it; considering who's working on this series, there shouldn't be any concern. If the trailer is anything to go by, Vampire in the Garden should be as good a Wit Studio anime as they come. RELATED: Marco's Final Words on Attack on Titan Are the Anime's Most Important The director for Vampire in the Garden is Makihara Ryōtarō. He's also known for directing Hal and, more importantly, The Empire of Corpses. The latter is a psychological sci-fi movie that delves into the disturbing nature of the undead and reanimation, not unlike Marie Shelley's Frankenstein. That moderate touch of horror would fit perfectly in a vampire-centric narrative. The soundtrack will be composed by Yoshihiro Ike. He's known for composing the music for AIBOU: Tokyo Detective Duo and Tiger & Bunny. He can compose in a broad range of musical styles; his work can be something grand like ""The Hero of Heroes"" or something simple like ""The Mechanic."" For Vampire in the Garden, he might put out more songs like ""The Voice of Thanatos"" or ""Aftermath."" In any case, the soundtrack for this upcoming anime should be full of memorable tunes and melodies. RELATED: The Most Powerful Otsutsuki in Naruto – and How They Got So Strong                  Again, the character designer for this series is Tetsuya Nishio. He's best known for designing characters for the Naruto anime, as well as Naruto: Shippuden and Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. The resemblance is plain to see in the Vampire in the Garden characters, right down to the facial expressions. Even some of their movements and color schemes look familiar. If characters from either of these works swapped places, none of them would look out of place. Naruto fans should certainly get a nostalgic vibe from Vampire in the Garden. As things stand, Vampire in the Garden looks like it's set to be a great new series for anime fans. Not only is it being done by a talented studio, but it has a number of veterans of the industry working on it. Audiences should look forward to watching it when it arrives on Netflix in May.

By Louis Kemner Published 6 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Love of Kill Episode 12, ""My Name,"" now streaming on Crunchyroll. In previous episodes of Love of Kill, the haunted heroine Chateau Dankworth recalled her violent past with the original Ryang-Ha Song and his mysterious imposter, and flashbacks finally shed some light on how she and the two of them are connected. Now in the Season 1 finale, Chateau must do something about the strained emotions inside her. Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha are currently hiding from the vicious Mr. Donny and his young assassins, but she's not in the clear just yet. She cannot bear the guilt of having shot the original Ryang-Ha in a moment of panic but the new one is here to help, and the two unlikely allies may find a way to move on from the past and face the future together.  RELATED: Platinum End: Was it Muni Who Plotted to [SPOILER] Heaven?                  Ryang-Ha brings Chateau to one of his safe houses in the attic of a small apartment. There she awakens from many hours of sleep, with her troubled past still on her mind. She admits to remembering everything about the fateful night when she shot the original Ryang-Ha by accident, and admits these memories are why she cannot push her yandere-style lover away in the present day. Chateau and the new Ryang-Ha have a strong connection thanks to the original's sacrifice, and Episode 12 makes it clear that this bond is more wholesome than Ryang-Ha's earlier antics might have suggested. Earlier in Love of Kill, the current Ryang-Ha was an obnoxious yandere who pestered Chateau nonstop as her self-appointed guardian. She simply couldn't get rid of this pest, even aboard the Artemisia cruise ship. At the time, it wasn't clear if Ryang-Ha was acting out of genuine affection or jealous self-interest, and his mysterious background didn't help. Now, recent episodes assure viewers that Ryang-Ha always truly had Chateau's best interests at heart. The guardian feels responsible for Chateau after the original Ryang-Ha Song's death, and protecting her after all these years is his way of paying tribute to the original's memory. In the present day, Chateau understands and accepts this, and once she processes her guilt, she and Ryang-Ha get ready for the next step. RELATED: The Strongest Sage's Final Episode Leaves a Lot to be Desired                  Once Chateau finishes working through her difficult emotions, she settles down and helps Ryang-Ha clean up the dusty safe house -- and requests to formally hire him as her agent. He refuses to be paid any money, however, and specifies that he wants something different from her. Chateau is stumped, but he's most likely asking for her genuine affection, possibly as his girlfriend. Ryang-Ha has been an obnoxious but well-meaning Mr. Romance since the start in Love of Kill, and with everything quiet again, he has the chance to express that side of him once more. He's enamored with Chateau, allowing the shojo side of this seinen-style thriller series to shine forth. The two of them may actually become a couple in a possible Season 2, or at least take the first steps in that direction. There's no longer anyone or anything to get in the way. As Season 1 concludes, Chateau and Ryang-Ha are on the roof when a helicopter arrives and they whip out their pistols, ready for action. By now, they both have a deeper and more respectful understanding of one another and their relationship. Chateau accepts Ryang-Ha as her lovestruck bodyguard while he acknowledges her as his true equal and partner, and not just someone who needs protection. Despite being the shojo heroine since the start, Chateau relied heavily on Ryang-Ha and other characters for survival and purpose. Now she has truly blossomed, and Ryang-Ha is clearly happy for her. They can face the future and its dangers side by side as co-stars of the winter anime season's bloodiest shojo adventure.

By Patrick Morris Published 18 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    School-based anime have a tendency toward the grandiose, both aesthetically and narratively. All too often, the characters are hyper-attractive, super-powered members of the social elite who never seem to go to class. Additionally, many high school series incorporate a student ranking system that -- while tremendously fun -- is silly to the extreme. A famous example is the contemporary cult classic Kakegurui. The students of Kakegurui are ranked according to how many games of chance they win. The more frequently -- and the more money -- students win, the further they advance in the school's rankings. This means that students who lose and fall into debt descend in the rankings, and are consequently treated as slaves to the student body. Preposterous as that sounds, there's one preceding series with a ranking system that's even more ridiculous.  RELATED: Why Does Kakegurui Make Gambling So Erotic?                  2010's Baka and Test is a short, spitfire parody series that pulls no punches. The title is rife with wacky, madcap humor, characters that feel simultaneously accessible and entertaining and enough nosebleeds to make even High School DxD characters roll their eyes. Baka and Test also utilizes an interesting, integral student ranking system that's as bonkers as it is brilliant. The series takes place in the fictional Fumizuki Preparatory Academy. Immediately following their entrance exams, students are sorted into one of six classes between A and F. Students in the top-ranking A class are awarded significant perks, such as a snack bar, luxuriously furnished air-conditioned classrooms and school-issued laptops. Those relegated to class F are provided with the shabbiest classrooms, low (often broken) wooden tables for desks and flat, weathered cushions for seats. However, it's possible for low-rank classes to earn access to the special incentives given to their high-ranking counterparts. RELATED: Why Jujutsu Kaisen's Itadori Yuji Should Have Gone to This Anime School Instead                  Fumizuki Academy has a unique system in place wherein students may conjure Summoned Beings, or ""Avatars."" With the approval of a teacher, these Summoned Beings are permitted to do battle with one another. A principal caveat to these battles is that the strength of the students' Summoned Beings is determined by the students' most recent score in the presiding teacher's subject. So, if the Classical Japanese teacher has approved a battle, the engaging Beings' strengths will be based on the most recent Classical Japanese test scores of their respective students. During a battle, Summoned Beings lose points as they are struck. If a Being loses all of its points, the student commanding it must take a remedial class taught by the stern-faced instructor Nishimura Soichi. If a student has done well and routinely studies -- like the series' female lead Himeji Mizuki -- their Summoned Being is more likely to be strong. However, if a student is (to put it politely) not a great test-taker -- like the lazy, half-witted male lead Yoshii Akihisa -- they're going to have trouble advancing not only academically but also socially. RELATED: Disney+'s First Exclusive Anime, Summer Time Rendering, Debuts Trailer                  Fumizuki Academy's battle system is primarily used in what's known as the Summoner Test War. During a Summoner Test War, two entire classes fight in a melee-style battle against one another. A Test War is concluded only when a class's Representative -- the highest-ranking individual within a class -- has been defeated. Should a low-ranking class prove victorious over one of the higher-ranking classes, they earn the opportunity to upgrade their classroom and equipment, as well as gain access to the other extemporaneous perks, such as vending machines or the snack bar. As ludicrous as Baka and Test's ranking system is, it has something pivotal working in its favor: it is inextricably linked to academics. Most school-based anime -- and Kakegurui is no exception -- keep education on the periphery, if they address it at all (seriously, how many scenes from Kakegurui actually take place during class?). Baka and Test takes a more refreshing track, opting to keep the value of quality education at the forefront of the narrative. True, the core cast is mainly studying so hard to take advantage of the benefits afforded to high-ranking classes, but they are still learning. The characters are depicted attending classes, doing homework and studying -- a shockingly rare quality among high school series. Although parodic in its execution, Baka and Test does the truly innovative and returns the high school series to the classroom, giving audiences plenty to consider in the process.

02-04-2022,anime,4,0,,Baka and Test’s Classroom Ranking Is Ridiculous Fun,"   Baka and Test’s School Ranking System Rivals Kakegurui for Ridiculousness Kakegurui is known for its outlandish school ranking system, but predecessor Baka and Test has a unique system that's even more ludicrous and fun.     By Patrick Morris Published 18 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    School-based anime have a tendency toward the grandiose, both aesthetically and narratively. All too often, the characters are hyper-attractive, super-powered members of the social elite who never seem to go to class. Additionally, many high school series incorporate a student ranking system that -- while tremendously fun -- is silly to the extreme. A famous example is the contemporary cult classic Kakegurui. The students of Kakegurui are ranked according to how many games of chance they win. The more frequently -- and the more money -- students win, the further they advance in the school's rankings. This means that students who lose and fall into debt descend in the rankings, and are consequently treated as slaves to the student body. Preposterous as that sounds, there's one preceding series with a ranking system that's even more ridiculous.  RELATED: Why Does Kakegurui Make Gambling So Erotic?                  2010's Baka and Test is a short, spitfire parody series that pulls no punches. The title is rife with wacky, madcap humor, characters that feel simultaneously accessible and entertaining and enough nosebleeds to make even High School DxD characters roll their eyes. Baka and Test also utilizes an interesting, integral student ranking system that's as bonkers as it is brilliant. The series takes place in the fictional Fumizuki Preparatory Academy. Immediately following their entrance exams, students are sorted into one of six classes between A and F. Students in the top-ranking A class are awarded significant perks, such as a snack bar, luxuriously furnished air-conditioned classrooms and school-issued laptops. Those relegated to class F are provided with the shabbiest classrooms, low (often broken) wooden tables for desks and flat, weathered cushions for seats. However, it's possible for low-rank classes to earn access to the special incentives given to their high-ranking counterparts. RELATED: Why Jujutsu Kaisen's Itadori Yuji Should Have Gone to This Anime School Instead                  Fumizuki Academy has a unique system in place wherein students may conjure Summoned Beings, or ""Avatars."" With the approval of a teacher, these Summoned Beings are permitted to do battle with one another. A principal caveat to these battles is that the strength of the students' Summoned Beings is determined by the students' most recent score in the presiding teacher's subject. So, if the Classical Japanese teacher has approved a battle, the engaging Beings' strengths will be based on the most recent Classical Japanese test scores of their respective students. During a battle, Summoned Beings lose points as they are struck. If a Being loses all of its points, the student commanding it must take a remedial class taught by the stern-faced instructor Nishimura Soichi. If a student has done well and routinely studies -- like the series' female lead Himeji Mizuki -- their Summoned Being is more likely to be strong. However, if a student is (to put it politely) not a great test-taker -- like the lazy, half-witted male lead Yoshii Akihisa -- they're going to have trouble advancing not only academically but also socially. RELATED: Disney+'s First Exclusive Anime, Summer Time Rendering, Debuts Trailer                  Fumizuki Academy's battle system is primarily used in what's known as the Summoner Test War. During a Summoner Test War, two entire classes fight in a melee-style battle against one another. A Test War is concluded only when a class's Representative -- the highest-ranking individual within a class -- has been defeated. Should a low-ranking class prove victorious over one of the higher-ranking classes, they earn the opportunity to upgrade their classroom and equipment, as well as gain access to the other extemporaneous perks, such as vending machines or the snack bar. As ludicrous as Baka and Test's ranking system is, it has something pivotal working in its favor: it is inextricably linked to academics. Most school-based anime -- and Kakegurui is no exception -- keep education on the periphery, if they address it at all (seriously, how many scenes from Kakegurui actually take place during class?). Baka and Test takes a more refreshing track, opting to keep the value of quality education at the forefront of the narrative. True, the core cast is mainly studying so hard to take advantage of the benefits afforded to high-ranking classes, but they are still learning. The characters are depicted attending classes, doing homework and studying -- a shockingly rare quality among high school series. Although parodic in its execution, Baka and Test does the truly innovative and returns the high school series to the classroom, giving audiences plenty to consider in the process.

Let's dive into its differences.     By Jenelle Catherina Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Winter 2022 was quite an eventful season for anime, but nothing stood out more like My Dress-Up Darling. Equally loved for the adorable romance between the main characters Gojo and Marin and critiqued for the over-the-top and excessive fanservice, this anime has had fans talking since Episode 1. Now that the final episode of Season 1 has aired, it has been critically acclaimed as a pretty true-to-manga adaptation. Still, nothing is ever perfect, and there are some small changes within the anime -- so what changed exactly from the manga to the anime? RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling’s Pervasive Fan Service Undermines a Positive Message  The first change occurs right away in the opening of Episode 1. In the anime, we see a young Gojo looking up and admiring his grandfather's doll, mesmerized by its beauty. In the manga, there's no sign here of a young Gojo, just a younger version of his grandfather telling an off-panel Gojo about how he too can make dolls one day, before abruptly showing the traumatic moment in his childhood where his former friend disowns him for his ""feminine"" hobby. Obviously, this is only a minor change. The first major change in the first episode is the manner in which Marin and Gojo first interact with each other. In the manga, she merely bumps into him and apologizes, but in the anime, Marin's encounter is more over-the-top. She is seen literally flying through the air and landing head-first on the corner of Gojo's desk, which honestly looks very concussion-inducing. A moment later though, she reveals that she is completely fine. This change was probably added to set up the outlandishness and comedy of the show.                  In Episode 5, the anime cuts a scene that occurs while Gojo is taking Marin's photos as Shizuku-tan for the first time. In the manga, Gojo is visibly flustered after Marin states she didn't bring any clothes to change back into. This scene is exchanged in favor of a simpler smartphone photo montage. Similarly in Episode 8, during the beach scene, a fan-servicey panty shot scene is replaced in favor of a bird stealing Marin and Gojo's lunch. In contrast, the iconic love hotel episode is adapted to the tee with no changes whatsoever, much to the excitement of manga fans. The final episode of the series has the most manga to anime changes. It starts off right away with a minor change. In the manga, the episode opens with Gojo working on his next cosplay project, while in the anime, he is working on a doll. The biggest cut in this scene is the presence of Marin's father. In the manga, he comes home to check on Marin and is upset when she reveals that she hasn't been doing her homework, which prompts her to study with Gojo. In the anime, this conversation is reduced to a phone call, and viewers never see Marin's father on screen. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Definitely Written for the Female Gaze Another huge change is the order of events. In the manga, the events occur as follows: the encounter with Marin's father, the school pool scene, the fireworks festival and the scary movie sequence. However, in the anime, the movie scene is split in two and bookends the episode. It occurs as such: movie, pool scene, festival, then concludes with Marin calling Gojo about how scared she is in the post-credit scene after watching the movie's sequel by herself. Understandably, the writers wanted the season to end on a happy note, so they likely changed things around so that Marin could end the season saying the long-awaited ""I love you"" to Gojo, even if he didn't actually hear it. The season ends with Marin looking directly at the camera and saying ""See you later,"" which is probably intended to be a heartfelt fourth wall break.                  Evidently, the anime follows the manga quite closely, and besides some minor cuts and chronological changes, there are no major plot differences from the manga to the movie, which has pleased manga fans. With such a great first season, will the second season be able to hold up? There is no announcement for the second season as of yet, but judging by its success, there will no doubt be an announcement sometime soon.

02-04-2022,anime,6,0,,My Dress-Up Darling's Biggest Changes From the Manga,"   The My Dress-Up Darling Anime's Biggest Changes From the Manga My Dress-Up Darling is often praised as a pretty faithful adaptation to its manga, but there are still some changes. Let's dive into its differences.     By Jenelle Catherina Published 4 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Winter 2022 was quite an eventful season for anime, but nothing stood out more like My Dress-Up Darling. Equally loved for the adorable romance between the main characters Gojo and Marin and critiqued for the over-the-top and excessive fanservice, this anime has had fans talking since Episode 1. Now that the final episode of Season 1 has aired, it has been critically acclaimed as a pretty true-to-manga adaptation. Still, nothing is ever perfect, and there are some small changes within the anime -- so what changed exactly from the manga to the anime? RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling’s Pervasive Fan Service Undermines a Positive Message  The first change occurs right away in the opening of Episode 1. In the anime, we see a young Gojo looking up and admiring his grandfather's doll, mesmerized by its beauty. In the manga, there's no sign here of a young Gojo, just a younger version of his grandfather telling an off-panel Gojo about how he too can make dolls one day, before abruptly showing the traumatic moment in his childhood where his former friend disowns him for his ""feminine"" hobby. Obviously, this is only a minor change. The first major change in the first episode is the manner in which Marin and Gojo first interact with each other. In the manga, she merely bumps into him and apologizes, but in the anime, Marin's encounter is more over-the-top. She is seen literally flying through the air and landing head-first on the corner of Gojo's desk, which honestly looks very concussion-inducing. A moment later though, she reveals that she is completely fine. This change was probably added to set up the outlandishness and comedy of the show.                  In Episode 5, the anime cuts a scene that occurs while Gojo is taking Marin's photos as Shizuku-tan for the first time. In the manga, Gojo is visibly flustered after Marin states she didn't bring any clothes to change back into. This scene is exchanged in favor of a simpler smartphone photo montage. Similarly in Episode 8, during the beach scene, a fan-servicey panty shot scene is replaced in favor of a bird stealing Marin and Gojo's lunch. In contrast, the iconic love hotel episode is adapted to the tee with no changes whatsoever, much to the excitement of manga fans. The final episode of the series has the most manga to anime changes. It starts off right away with a minor change. In the manga, the episode opens with Gojo working on his next cosplay project, while in the anime, he is working on a doll. The biggest cut in this scene is the presence of Marin's father. In the manga, he comes home to check on Marin and is upset when she reveals that she hasn't been doing her homework, which prompts her to study with Gojo. In the anime, this conversation is reduced to a phone call, and viewers never see Marin's father on screen. RELATED: My Dress-Up Darling's Gojo Is Definitely Written for the Female Gaze Another huge change is the order of events. In the manga, the events occur as follows: the encounter with Marin's father, the school pool scene, the fireworks festival and the scary movie sequence. However, in the anime, the movie scene is split in two and bookends the episode. It occurs as such: movie, pool scene, festival, then concludes with Marin calling Gojo about how scared she is in the post-credit scene after watching the movie's sequel by herself. Understandably, the writers wanted the season to end on a happy note, so they likely changed things around so that Marin could end the season saying the long-awaited ""I love you"" to Gojo, even if he didn't actually hear it. The season ends with Marin looking directly at the camera and saying ""See you later,"" which is probably intended to be a heartfelt fourth wall break.                  Evidently, the anime follows the manga quite closely, and besides some minor cuts and chronological changes, there are no major plot differences from the manga to the movie, which has pleased manga fans. With such a great first season, will the second season be able to hold up? There is no announcement for the second season as of yet, but judging by its success, there will no doubt be an announcement sometime soon.

What Will Yangchen's Novel Reveal About The Avatar Before Her? The Dawn of Yangchen novel will follow the Avatar's rise to becoming a legend, but she needs to do that in Avatar Szeto's shadow.     By Brenton Stewart Published 38 minutes ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Avatar: The Last Airbender depicted Aang's struggles saving the world from the challenges the previous Avatars created, and ever since then, it has been a theme in the franchise to show how every Avatar responds to the legacy of their predecessors. In the prequel novels The Rise of Kyoshi and The Shadow of Kyoshi, this proved truer than ever, as Kyoshi not only had to deal with the problems of Kuruk's time but also meet the legendary standard that Yangchen set before her. In The Dawn of Yangchen, the cycle will continue as the prequel novel explores Yangchen's own challenges in living up to her predecessor, Avatar Szeto. But just what do we know about Szeto's legacy, and what might that mean for Yangchen's journey?  RELATED: Avatar Roku's Waterbending Master May Be the Greatest Waterbender of All Time                  Much of Yangchen's life is largely a mystery in the Avatar franchise, as she was seldom seen in the original series. Luckily, the novels and comics provide more detail about her life, fleshing out Yangchen as a legendary figure who navigated international tensions with such diplomacy that she kept the world safe from war even past her own lifetime. The comic The Rift even delves into a conflict she had with the spirit General Old Iron shortly after she mastered the four elements. However, judging by The Dawn of Yangchen's synopsis, much of the story will take place around or even before the earlier days of her career. The synopsis for the novel emphasizes Yangchen's inexperience during its setting and her growth into her role as Avatar in stark contrast to her predecessor Szeto. It sets up a story in which Yangchen's struggles with Earth Kingdom politics and the threat of a weapon of mass destruction threaten the stability of the world, but from what we know of Szeto's time, such political machinations were the Fire Avatar's forte. RELATED: Stunning Avatar Fan Art Spotlights Aang's Cutest Companion The Shadow of Kyoshi established that Szeto was a wise and tactical Avatar whose primary accomplishments resulted from his mastery of bureaucracy as much as the four elements. Rising through the ranks of the Fire Nation's political infrastructure, Szeto became the Grand Advisor to Fire Lord Ysor. With a shrewd sense of accounting and diplomacy, he managed to unify the Fire Nation government during a time of great strife and hardship from natural disasters, making him a revered figure even generations after his death. However, what's most notable about what we know of Szeto's life is how little of it seemed to hold influence over the rest of the world. Although Szeto is widely celebrated in the Fire Nation, there is little to nothing in the canon about his influence on the political stability in the other Four Nations. While he was undoubtedly a powerful bender, seen in a flashback erupting multiple volcanos while in the Avatar State, it seems that what Yangchen may have to deal with primarily are his failings to balance the rest of the world while tending to his own nation. RELATED: Avatar Legends: What Was Wan Shi Tong's Library Like Before Aang?                  Indeed, the Earth Kingdom proved to be rife with corruption and conflict by the Era of Kyoshi two cycles later, and the problems there were so deeply entrenched that they remained even in the days of following Avatars like Roku, Aang and Korra. This could mean that the inexperienced Yangchen is in over her head where the Earth Kingdom's crown is concerned. Given that the Air Nomad survives the conflicts of her time and manages to succeed where Szeto failed, this stands out as one of the most intriguing elements of the upcoming novel that fans should anticipate. Indeed, Yangchen's own failings were already explored in the prior Kyoshi novels. Every good story needs a good conflict, after all, and it appears that Yangchen will have no shortage of those in the days before she became the myth that would last for generations.

The Genius Prince’s Guide has long established that Prince Wein Salema Arbalest is no angel. With his first war alone, Wein demonstrated a lack of empathy for his own army when offering them empty words of encouragement, expecting them to lose the battle with Marden. When they actually won the war -- not once, but twice -- he was genuinely stunned. In addition to having accidentally helped dismantle an entire kingdom, Wein was noticed by other neighboring kingdoms, including the Earthworld Empire. He even received a marriage proposal from Princess Lowellmina of Earthworld, who turned out to be his childhood friend ""Lowa.""  In worse news for Wein, his defeat of Marden got him noticed by the more bigoted western kingdoms of Cavarin, Soljest and Delunio -- all of which subscribe to the Levetian religion with their monarchs being members of the Holy Elite. Delunio in particular owned land in Marden, putting Wein in an even bigger political bind. This caused the western kingdoms to conspire against him, looking to control or even murder him. They were caught off guard, however, by Wein's impulsive murder of King Ordalasse of Cavarin. Now in Episode 12, the protagonist reveals an even more monstrous side in dealing with his biggest foes. RELATED: The Genius Prince’s Guide: Wein Answers Lowa’s Marriage Proposal Amid Chaos                  Wein had been caught fraudulently exporting Earthworld goods as Natran products to the western kingdoms to subvert their refusal to trade with the empire. This action gets Princess Zenovia -- Marden's sole surviving monarch -- in trouble with the western kingdoms, which results in a threat from Delunio's prime minister, Sirgis. Wein takes responsibility for the exports and visits the kingdom of Soljest in order to form an alliance with King Gruyere. To Wein's surprise, he actually agrees to an alliance and shares his more liberal political views, which earns his trust. Unbeknown to Wein, however, King Gruyere's plan was all a ruse to get him out of the way while he conspired with Prime Minister Sirgis behind the scenes to take back Marden's land, which led to Soljest invading Natra. After being played for a fool by Gruyere, Wein realized he had to act quickly to dissolve the alliance between Soljest and Delunio -- easier said than done. Careful planning of that dissolution would’ve gone a lot smoother had Wein gone to Princess Lowa to work out the details, but he didn't want to be indebted to the equally diabolical Lowa. Instead, he cooks up an even worse plan: to threaten genocide. Episode 12 of The Genius Prince's Guide sees Wein and Zenovia pay a visit to Prime Minister Sirgis to try and work out a peaceful reconciliation. Zenovia attempts to appease Sirgis by offering double the land that is owed to Delunio in exchange for getting the Soljest army to stop their invasion of Natra. Sirgis, however, sees through the proposal and doesn't accept her offer. With Zenovia’s plan failing, Wein decides to take matters into his own hands by proposing that Sirgis murder King Gruyere before his kingdom grows to the point of deciding to invade Delunio. Sirgis once again isn't moved -- so Wein goes with Plan B. RELATED: The Genius Prince’s Guide: Wein Gets Burnt By a Certain Princess - & It's Not Lowa                  Knowing that Soljest is too powerful for Natra's army to beat, Wein acknowledges Gruyere will succeed in seizing Natra, which will displace all of its citizens. He also acknowledges his people will seek refuge in other kingdoms, including Delunio, which Sirgis accepts. After getting his ""approval,"" Wein gleefully tells Sirgis he will send all of his people as refugees to Delunio, which catches the prime minister off guard. Sirgis protests by saying his nation can only accept a few hundred refugees, but any more would exhaust Delunio's resources. Wein, however, has a solution to that too. To resolve the problem of overpopulation, Wein tricks Sirgis into thinking he’s been secretly exporting a deadly poison to Delunio's citizens through their clothing. Over time, wearing these poisonous clothes will kill all of Delunio’s citizens and the kingdom would be ripe for the picking for Natra’s refugees. This plan proves too monstrous for Zenovia who is immediately horrified by Wein's logic, even if he's suggesting genocide in jest. Sirgis, though, is in a worse position. While Sirgis does contemplate the possibility Wein is bluffing, at the same time he decides not to stake his political career by risking his own people's lives -- but then cracks under pressure and agrees to ally with Wein to stop Soljest's invasion of Natra. By acquiring Delunio's army, Natra's own now has the support it needs to defeat Soljest and capture King Gruyere. This manages to impress Gruyere, who then awaits his own execution. Wein, however, offers him an alliance with Natra in exchange for learning the secret to Wein's genius. The prince's intelligence shines through once again, but in so doing has revealed an even darker side to his character.

Is Attack on Titan's Upcoming Episode Really the Finale? The last episode of the season, and perhaps the series as a whole, is just around the corner. But with so much unresolved, how will it wrap things up?     By Chris Nishijima Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4 - The Final Season: Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The world-shaking anime adaptation of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan is finally heading toward its conclusion. Its current set of episodes has left viewers questioning everything that they know about the series, from the nature of the world that the Eldians inhabit to the motivations of the show's most central character. However, even with so many questions hanging in the air, one puzzle in particular seems to be plaguing audiences -- is episode 87, which is set to debut within the next few days, really the conclusion of the television anime?  RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper                  At first glance, the answer to this query seems relatively straightforward. Prior to the premiere of the ongoing run, the series' studio MAPPA listed Season 4, Part 2 as consisting of 12 episodes. Furthermore, while many widely popular shows like Demon Slayer have made use of extra-long episodes to either conclude or kick off storylines, as they did in the most recent ""Entertainment District"" arc, this does not appear to be the case with Attack on Titan. Although there has been no such denial of an elongated finale from any official source, discussion online has pointed to Japanese television guides to corroborate the standard 25-minute timeslot. Streaming service Crunchyroll even hyped up the upcoming episode as the finale, releasing a special teaser trailer leaning into the tension of the upcoming fight to stop Eren from annihilating the outside world.                  Nevertheless, the apocalypse-level struggle between Eren and his former comrades seems to warrant far more screentime than a single episode can provide. This is especially true because the episode's title, ""Dawn of Humanity,"" correlates with a manga chapter of the same name -- one that has nine chapters of content after it. Since the show's most recent season has maintained a pace of one chapter per episode, squeezing ten full chapters into a single episode would be a massive shift in pace, no matter how long said episode is. RELATED: How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? This has led fans to speculate about the possibility that rather than conclude the anime on television, MAPPA could be planning to finish things off with a movie instead. Recent box office hits like Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Demon Slayer: Mugen Train have proven that anime films related to ongoing series can be just as lucrative as any other feature. That being said, neither of these two served as series finales, with the former being a prequel and the latter depicting a mid-season arc.                  While there have been movies that were released after the closing of their anime series, these have typically resembled epilogues, side stories or teases for potential continuations, such as The Last: Naruto the Movie or Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie - Rebellion. Utilizing a movie as the true ending of a series would be fairly unprecedented, with the exception of features such as The End of Evangelion -- although even that was more of an alternate version of the televised ending rather than the definitive final act. RELATED: Attack on Titan Theory: Zeke's Spinal Fluid Led to [SPOILER's] Unique Transformation Another possibility is that MAPPA is planning on extending their so-called ""Final Season"" once more into a third part. This might sound like a somewhat misleading ploy at stringing viewers along, but it wouldn't be entirely surprising either. During the initial airing of Season 1, Part 1, there was little mention that the ""Final Season"" would be broken up into segments that would air a little over a year apart from each other. The remaining number of chapters could easily be enough to constitute a Part 3 on their own, especially if they include extended fight scenes and afterword material.                  Whatever the resolution may be, Episode 87 is currently expected to be the final episode, at least as far as Season 4, Part 2 is concerned. Regardless of any further announcement of a continuation or decision to wrap it all up in one go, there is no word on there being more to Attack on Titan in the foreseeable future. Still, MAPPA has done an excellent job of adapting the series thus far, giving each chapter the attention and time it needs to shine. One can only hope that this upcoming episode, whatever it may be, will be treated in the same way.

02-04-2022,anime,5,0,,How Many Episodes Are Left in Attack on Titan?,"   Is Attack on Titan's Upcoming Episode Really the Finale? The last episode of the season, and perhaps the series as a whole, is just around the corner. But with so much unresolved, how will it wrap things up?     By Chris Nishijima Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Attack on Titan Season 4 - The Final Season: Part 2, now streaming on Funimation, Hulu and Crunchyroll. The world-shaking anime adaptation of Hajime Isayama's Attack on Titan is finally heading toward its conclusion. Its current set of episodes has left viewers questioning everything that they know about the series, from the nature of the world that the Eldians inhabit to the motivations of the show's most central character. However, even with so many questions hanging in the air, one puzzle in particular seems to be plaguing audiences -- is episode 87, which is set to debut within the next few days, really the conclusion of the television anime?  RELATED: Attack on Titan: The Scouts Found Their New Sniper                  At first glance, the answer to this query seems relatively straightforward. Prior to the premiere of the ongoing run, the series' studio MAPPA listed Season 4, Part 2 as consisting of 12 episodes. Furthermore, while many widely popular shows like Demon Slayer have made use of extra-long episodes to either conclude or kick off storylines, as they did in the most recent ""Entertainment District"" arc, this does not appear to be the case with Attack on Titan. Although there has been no such denial of an elongated finale from any official source, discussion online has pointed to Japanese television guides to corroborate the standard 25-minute timeslot. Streaming service Crunchyroll even hyped up the upcoming episode as the finale, releasing a special teaser trailer leaning into the tension of the upcoming fight to stop Eren from annihilating the outside world.                  Nevertheless, the apocalypse-level struggle between Eren and his former comrades seems to warrant far more screentime than a single episode can provide. This is especially true because the episode's title, ""Dawn of Humanity,"" correlates with a manga chapter of the same name -- one that has nine chapters of content after it. Since the show's most recent season has maintained a pace of one chapter per episode, squeezing ten full chapters into a single episode would be a massive shift in pace, no matter how long said episode is. RELATED: How Would Attack on Titan Have Changed If Erwin Became the Colossal Titan? This has led fans to speculate about the possibility that rather than conclude the anime on television, MAPPA could be planning to finish things off with a movie instead. Recent box office hits like Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Demon Slayer: Mugen Train have proven that anime films related to ongoing series can be just as lucrative as any other feature. That being said, neither of these two served as series finales, with the former being a prequel and the latter depicting a mid-season arc.                  While there have been movies that were released after the closing of their anime series, these have typically resembled epilogues, side stories or teases for potential continuations, such as The Last: Naruto the Movie or Puella Magi Madoka Magica: The Movie - Rebellion. Utilizing a movie as the true ending of a series would be fairly unprecedented, with the exception of features such as The End of Evangelion -- although even that was more of an alternate version of the televised ending rather than the definitive final act. RELATED: Attack on Titan Theory: Zeke's Spinal Fluid Led to [SPOILER's] Unique Transformation Another possibility is that MAPPA is planning on extending their so-called ""Final Season"" once more into a third part. This might sound like a somewhat misleading ploy at stringing viewers along, but it wouldn't be entirely surprising either. During the initial airing of Season 1, Part 1, there was little mention that the ""Final Season"" would be broken up into segments that would air a little over a year apart from each other. The remaining number of chapters could easily be enough to constitute a Part 3 on their own, especially if they include extended fight scenes and afterword material.                  Whatever the resolution may be, Episode 87 is currently expected to be the final episode, at least as far as Season 4, Part 2 is concerned. Regardless of any further announcement of a continuation or decision to wrap it all up in one go, there is no word on there being more to Attack on Titan in the foreseeable future. Still, MAPPA has done an excellent job of adapting the series thus far, giving each chapter the attention and time it needs to shine. One can only hope that this upcoming episode, whatever it may be, will be treated in the same way.

By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com anime series that is due to return in the Spring 2022 anime season, and anime fans stand to learn a lot from this charming edutainment anime series. Similar to Dr. Stone and Cells at Work!, this anime can entertain viewers with charming characters and skits while also teaching them real-life science. Protagonists Yukimura Shinya and Himuro Ayame both use real-life science to explain their experiments in the world of love, and they are happy to explain the inner workings of their theories and methods during an episode. To back them up, there's also the bonus character Rikekuma the science bear, a talking teddy bear who goes in-depth on a variety of topics in between scenes.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya The Role Of Rikekuma The Science Bear                  Rikekuma the science bear isn't a proper character in the series -- that is, Rikekuma never interacts with anyone else in the main cast of Science Fell in Love, and none of the main characters even acknowledge or seem to be aware of Rikekuma at all. Instead, this talking teddy bear is more like a mascot for the series who appears in between scenes to deliver lectures that would interrupt the pacing of an actual scene in Science Fell in Love. Rikekuma's main job is to deliver concise, detailed lectures on topics such as margins of error and the ""traveling salesman"" problem when the main characters cannot, and give Science Fell in Love fans more context for what Ayame and Shinya are talking about. Rikekuma, however, doesn't seem too thrilled with any of this. Amusingly, this bonus character usually seems to be in a bad mood, and Rikekuma seems to scorn humans for their sloppy and careless ways. Rikekuma usually delivers its lectures with an air of impatience and reluctance, which creates contrast with the charming and easygoing main characters, who are more interested in doki-doki heart rates and kissing than lecturing anyone. Rikekuma is a foil to the lovestruck Ayame and her kuudere lab partner Shinya, which helps provide balance in the series and keep it more grounded with a new perspective. Ayame often has her head in the clouds, so the grouchy Rikekuma is there to keep the anime's tone in check, and deliver some hard science all the while. Oddly, Rikekuma has an adorable appearance as a talking teddy bear in glasses, and it might even dress up during its lectures, unaware of how much it can charm viewers despite its attitude. There's no character quite like Rikekuma the science bear. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right Rikekuma's Best Science Lectures In The Anime                  Rikekuma the science bear appears in several episodes of Science Fell in Love and expanded upon a variety of intriguing topics without sounding too dry about it. One of Rikekuma's most memorable lectures involves the ""traveling salesman"" problem, a scenario describing how a single party can visit a set number of cities once each while traveling the shortest possible distance before returning to the original city. This scenario is a matter of optimizing a vast set of data where many combinations or routes for a solution may exist. In some cases, it may be hopelessly difficult to find the truly optimal route, so a scientist or researcher may have to make do with a moderately efficient route, and sacrifice the possibility of the ""perfect"" route. In many fields of research, only the most accurate, efficient, and relevant data is desired, but even scientists have their limits, and in some scenarios, finding the ""perfect"" route simply won't happen. In Science Fell in Love, for example, Shinya and Ayame went on a date and intended to visit every attraction at the amusement park in the most efficient manner to keep their schedule, but that's easier said than done. Rikekuma also delivered a lecture about the benefits of rounding, since many numbers in a scientific experiment or math problem are irrational numbers, with a patternless series of numbers stretching infinitely, such as 7.5827908264023148... and so on. Not even the most detail-oriented scientist would attempt a calculation with numbers like that, so scientists tend to round to a certain decimal place, such as the thousandths place. The irrational number given earlier, for example, could be rounded to 7.583, since the ""7"" after the ""2"" causes the 2 to become a 3, as the numbers 5-9 cause the previous one to go up. Then, during the amusement park sequence in Science Fell in Love Episode 4, Rikekuma explained now ""normalization"" works when working with data. In that episode, Shinya and Ayame wanted to calculate which new pair of shoes was the optimal one to buy, with price being just one of several factors, along with fashion sense, functionality, and base preference. These factors and more can be measured in different ways or not at all, so it's important for the researcher to treat each factor the same way so they can be calculated together -- in this case, every factor for the shoes was given a value out of 100. Otherwise, the calculations would be a case of ""apples to oranges.""

02-04-2022,anime,7,0,,Science Fell in Love: The Best Lessons of Rikekuma,"   Science Fell in Love: The Best Lessons of the Science Bear, Rikekuma The science bear can deliver a lecture on any topic, and audiences are encouraged to take notes.     By Louis Kemner Published 19 hours ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    Science Fell in Love So I Tried to Prove It is a charming rom-com anime series that is due to return in the Spring 2022 anime season, and anime fans stand to learn a lot from this charming edutainment anime series. Similar to Dr. Stone and Cells at Work!, this anime can entertain viewers with charming characters and skits while also teaching them real-life science. Protagonists Yukimura Shinya and Himuro Ayame both use real-life science to explain their experiments in the world of love, and they are happy to explain the inner workings of their theories and methods during an episode. To back them up, there's also the bonus character Rikekuma the science bear, a talking teddy bear who goes in-depth on a variety of topics in between scenes.  RELATED: The Best Rom-Com Anime to Watch After Horimiya The Role Of Rikekuma The Science Bear                  Rikekuma the science bear isn't a proper character in the series -- that is, Rikekuma never interacts with anyone else in the main cast of Science Fell in Love, and none of the main characters even acknowledge or seem to be aware of Rikekuma at all. Instead, this talking teddy bear is more like a mascot for the series who appears in between scenes to deliver lectures that would interrupt the pacing of an actual scene in Science Fell in Love. Rikekuma's main job is to deliver concise, detailed lectures on topics such as margins of error and the ""traveling salesman"" problem when the main characters cannot, and give Science Fell in Love fans more context for what Ayame and Shinya are talking about. Rikekuma, however, doesn't seem too thrilled with any of this. Amusingly, this bonus character usually seems to be in a bad mood, and Rikekuma seems to scorn humans for their sloppy and careless ways. Rikekuma usually delivers its lectures with an air of impatience and reluctance, which creates contrast with the charming and easygoing main characters, who are more interested in doki-doki heart rates and kissing than lecturing anyone. Rikekuma is a foil to the lovestruck Ayame and her kuudere lab partner Shinya, which helps provide balance in the series and keep it more grounded with a new perspective. Ayame often has her head in the clouds, so the grouchy Rikekuma is there to keep the anime's tone in check, and deliver some hard science all the while. Oddly, Rikekuma has an adorable appearance as a talking teddy bear in glasses, and it might even dress up during its lectures, unaware of how much it can charm viewers despite its attitude. There's no character quite like Rikekuma the science bear. RELATED: This Shojo-Based Anime Series is Survival Sci-Fi Done Right Rikekuma's Best Science Lectures In The Anime                  Rikekuma the science bear appears in several episodes of Science Fell in Love and expanded upon a variety of intriguing topics without sounding too dry about it. One of Rikekuma's most memorable lectures involves the ""traveling salesman"" problem, a scenario describing how a single party can visit a set number of cities once each while traveling the shortest possible distance before returning to the original city. This scenario is a matter of optimizing a vast set of data where many combinations or routes for a solution may exist. In some cases, it may be hopelessly difficult to find the truly optimal route, so a scientist or researcher may have to make do with a moderately efficient route, and sacrifice the possibility of the ""perfect"" route. In many fields of research, only the most accurate, efficient, and relevant data is desired, but even scientists have their limits, and in some scenarios, finding the ""perfect"" route simply won't happen. In Science Fell in Love, for example, Shinya and Ayame went on a date and intended to visit every attraction at the amusement park in the most efficient manner to keep their schedule, but that's easier said than done. Rikekuma also delivered a lecture about the benefits of rounding, since many numbers in a scientific experiment or math problem are irrational numbers, with a patternless series of numbers stretching infinitely, such as 7.5827908264023148... and so on. Not even the most detail-oriented scientist would attempt a calculation with numbers like that, so scientists tend to round to a certain decimal place, such as the thousandths place. The irrational number given earlier, for example, could be rounded to 7.583, since the ""7"" after the ""2"" causes the 2 to become a 3, as the numbers 5-9 cause the previous one to go up. Then, during the amusement park sequence in Science Fell in Love Episode 4, Rikekuma explained now ""normalization"" works when working with data. In that episode, Shinya and Ayame wanted to calculate which new pair of shoes was the optimal one to buy, with price being just one of several factors, along with fashion sense, functionality, and base preference. These factors and more can be measured in different ways or not at all, so it's important for the researcher to treat each factor the same way so they can be calculated together -- in this case, every factor for the shoes was given a value out of 100. Otherwise, the calculations would be a case of ""apples to oranges.""

By Hilary Leung Published 1 day ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    WARNING: The following contains spoilers for Choujin X, Chapter 18 by Sui Ishida, Jan Cash and Snir Aharon, available in English now from Viz Media and Manga Plus. The first few chapters of Sui Ishida's Choujin X introduced a pair of choujin who appeared to be working alongside -- or at least knew -- Nari, the White Snake Choujin who nearly killed Tokio the first time they met. One of the pair, Ririka Umezawa, made her presence known when the last panel of Chapter 17 showed her sitting beside Tokio and Ely with a paper cutout of a dog walking around on the train -- foreshadowing what was to come in Chapter 18.  Compared to the other choujins previously introduced, Umezawa doesn't look all that dangerous. She doesn't transform into a beast like Tokio or a snake like Nari, and her appearance doesn't look half as threatening as her partner who looks like an octopus. Umezama's powers don't allow her to change her body in any way like the Flexi Choujin, Johnny. But as always, it's the quiet and unassuming ones everyone has to watch out for. RELATED: unOrdinary: How Does John's Supernatural Ability Work - & Does It Have Limits?                  At the Hishizume Festival, Umezawa makes her move at a rapid fire pace. The first hint of her presence came in a flurry of innocuous-looking cutout paper dogs. Ishida makes great use of dramatic irony here; while Choujin X readers know what those paper dogs mean, Tokio doesn't. He has little time to process the situation before he gets stabbed by knives, which are drawn in a way that makes it clear these are cutouts as well. The tension gets hiked up further when Tokio collapses and starts bleeding, shocking readers that those weren't just some harmless paper knives. Umezawa's ability is called Papermoon (October Queen), which allows her to cut out shapes from paper -- but they possess the same qualities of the objects she's cutting out. The paper knives, the gigantic pair of scissors and the bundle of dynamite sticks are all very real and can kill. Her powers extend beyond that as well. She can use paper airplanes to fly and is even able to turn herself as thin as a paper, making her an extremely light, agile, flexible and formidable opponent. Previously in Chapter 17, Tokio had been a less than effective hero when he was turned into a package by the Package Choujin. There had been doubts around where he would ever become the type of hero he yearns to be, but Tokio displays a remarkable show of heroics here. He blocks off Umezawa's scissors attack and uses his own body to act as a cover when the dynamite sticks detonate, allowing him to save a train full of people. RELATED: How Tokyo Revengers Really Compares to Tokyo Ghoul                  Even though Ely has a better handle on her powers compared to Tokio, she's still no match for Umezawa who quickly immobilizes her with a single kick to her eye. All the Kirigami Choujin wants is Tokio. In a hilariously sad parallel to Chapter 17, Umezawa folds the unconscious Tokio up in a neat and tidy envelope, showing only his tie and tucking it into her dress before meeting up with her partner. When Tokio wakes up, he finds himself in a room with the tentacle choujin Ricardo. Having just been kidnapped, he's understandably tense. But the interactions between the two are surprisingly the opposite as Ricardo offers Tokio pizza after hearing his stomach growl. Although he witnessed Umezawa attempt to murder a train full of people, talking with Ricardo puts Tokio into an unsettling mood to the point where he questions whether Ricardo and Umezawa are the bad guys. Granted, not much is known about either of them or the organization they're working for, but Tokio's moment of hesitancy could be a hint that there's more than meets the eye in Choujin X -- at least for Ricardo and Umezawa.

Although he witnessed Umezawa attempt to murder a train full of people, talking with Ricardo puts Tokio into an unsettling mood to the point where he questions whether Ricardo and Umezawa are the bad guys. Granted, not much is known about either of them or the organization they're working for, but Tokio's moment of hesitancy could be a hint that there's more than meets the eye in Choujin X -- at least for Ricardo and Umezawa.

Bandai Namco Entertainment announced that it is bringing its beloved mascot Pac-Man, to That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: ISEKAI Memories, the 3D RPG for iOS and Android devices that retells the story of the popular anime and light novel series. The new crossover features a new chapter about the timeless arcade game written by Fuse, the isekai series' original author. Players will also be able to transform the series' main character, Rimuru Tempest, into Pac-Man and explore the country of Tempest as the classic gaming icon. The event will also feature new Pac-Man themed illustrations and animations on the game's log-in screen. The crossover content will be available in-game from March 31 until April 8.  RELATED: The Best Isekai Told From the 'Villain's' Perspective Pac-Man was created by Toru Iwatani in 1980. The original game was one of the biggest commercial hits of the early 1980s, and spawned an on-going franchise featuring dozens of sequels, spinoffs, TV shows, a playable appearance in Super Smash Bros. and even a hit single about the game's addictive nature. The original title alone has generated more than $14 billion USD in sales across its lifetime and is still widely regarded as one of the best designed games ever made. The character has become a mascot for Japanese entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco, and frequently makes cameo appearances within the company's other games. Namco is celebrating the character's history with the release of Pac-Man Museum+, a compilation of the franchise's most popular and influential games, which will be released for the Nintendo Switch, Sony PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Windows PCs on May 26. The Reincarnated as a Slime franchise began in 2014 as a series of light novels written by Fuse and illustrated by artist Mitz Vah. The novels were an immediate hit, moving over 4.5 million copies in circulation, and were quickly followed up with a manga adaptation in 2015. The series was also adapted into a hit anime, which premiered in 2018. The series tells the story of Satoru Mikami, a salaryman in Tokyo who suddenly dies one day and awakens to find out that he has been reincarnated as a slime, the lowliest of all fantasy monsters. Through creative use of his abilities, Satoru eventually earns the name Rimuru and is crowned the leader of Tempest, a nation that seeks to create a peaceful union between monsters and the other societies of the world. The That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime anime is available for streaming on Funimation and Crunchyroll. The original light novel series is localized and distributed in English by Yen Press, while the manga is available in both print and digital formats from Kodansha.

The poster art provides the first good look at the new character that will debut in the film. She was previously described as a singer with some kind of connection to Red-Haired Shanks, the infamous pirate captain who will also play a key role in the upcoming film. The still unnamed character is presented with her own Jolly Roger-style emblem, suggesting that she may be part of a new pirate crew. The new songstress is presented alongside text that when translated reads, ""Hey Luffy, you should stop being a pirate.""

Creator Eiichiro Oda is supervising production of the new movie. Oda previously revealed that his goal with the new movie was to add a new female character to the series' cast. ""I am tired of drawing legendary old grandpas in movies! I want to draw a new little female character! That's the character I want to make now! And that's how it started,"" Oda stated when the movie was first announced. The script for the new film is being penned by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, who previously wrote One Piece Film: Gold. The Straw Hats' latest theatrical outing is being directed by Goro Taniguchi, who is best known for his work on Code Geass. The movie will see Luffy and friends traveling to a new island in order to attend a music festival. The series' producers recently revealed that the Straw Hat Pirates will wear a number of new costumes during the course of the film: the first set, which appears to be the gang's vacation attire, was revealed at the most recent Jump Festa, while a second set of extra-piratey battle gear was unveiled earlier this month. RELATED: One Piece’s Monkey D. Luffy Is Now Shonen Jump Publisher’s AI Receptionist In addition to being a major player in the new animated movie, Netflix also revealed that Red-Haired Shanks will appear in its upcoming live-action reboot of the series. Actor Peter Gadoit, who played Cyrus in ABC's Once Upon A Time in Wonderland, will portray the pirate captain. The character of Shanks is known for being the figure who gave Luffy his iconic straw hat and inspired the stretchy young hero to take up a pirate's life. A selection of earlier One Piece movies are available for streaming on Netflix. One Piece Film: Red is scheduled to premiere in Japan this August. An international release date for the movie has yet to be announced.

By Michael Lacerna Published 5 days ago      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    One Piece Film: Red revealed a new movie poster. The poster art provides the first good look at the new character that will debut in the film. She was previously described as a singer with some kind of connection to Red-Haired Shanks, the infamous pirate captain who will also play a key role in the upcoming film. The still unnamed character is presented with her own Jolly Roger-style emblem, suggesting that she may be part of a new pirate crew. The new songstress is presented alongside text that when translated reads, ""Hey Luffy, you should stop being a pirate.""

Creator Eiichiro Oda is supervising production of the new movie. Oda previously revealed that his goal with the new movie was to add a new female character to the series' cast. ""I am tired of drawing legendary old grandpas in movies! I want to draw a new little female character! That's the character I want to make now! And that's how it started,"" Oda stated when the movie was first announced. The script for the new film is being penned by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, who previously wrote One Piece Film: Gold. The Straw Hats' latest theatrical outing is being directed by Goro Taniguchi, who is best known for his work on Code Geass. The movie will see Luffy and friends traveling to a new island in order to attend a music festival. The series' producers recently revealed that the Straw Hat Pirates will wear a number of new costumes during the course of the film: the first set, which appears to be the gang's vacation attire, was revealed at the most recent Jump Festa, while a second set of extra-piratey battle gear was unveiled earlier this month. RELATED: One Piece’s Monkey D. Luffy Is Now Shonen Jump Publisher’s AI Receptionist In addition to being a major player in the new animated movie, Netflix also revealed that Red-Haired Shanks will appear in its upcoming live-action reboot of the series. Actor Peter Gadoit, who played Cyrus in ABC's Once Upon A Time in Wonderland, will portray the pirate captain. The character of Shanks is known for being the figure who gave Luffy his iconic straw hat and inspired the stretchy young hero to take up a pirate's life. A selection of earlier One Piece movies are available for streaming on Netflix. One Piece Film: Red is scheduled to premiere in Japan this August. An international release date for the movie has yet to be announced.

By Ryan McCarthy Published Mar 23, 2022      Share    Share    Tweet    Email    0 Comment                    One of the most common criticisms of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is that the story is very simple. Tanjiro Kamado's family was slaughtered by demons and his only surviving sibling, Nezuko, has been turned into a demon whom he vows to transform back into a human. While it's fair to say that the plot of Demon Slayer is pretty straightforward, this is actually the series' greatest strength. Demon Slayer has never been overly interested in world-building, as the rules and stakes of the series were established early and remained unchanged for the entirety of the manga -- which concluded in May of 2020. Using the absence of extended exposition regarding shocking revelations and series-altering twists, Demon Slayer spends most of its time on the series' greatest asset, the characters.  Demon Slayer's endgame was established in the very first chapter of the manga when Giyu Tomioka told Tanjiro that his best chance at turning Nezuko back from a demon into a human was joining the Demon Slayer Corps. The next few chapters elaborated on the specifics of Total Concentration Breathing, Breathing Styles, and killing demons, but once the parameters of this new world were established, Demon Slayer never looked back. By doing all of the world-building early and quickly, the series freed itself up to spend the majority of its time developing the characters rather than the world around them. RELATED: Most Demon Slayers Have Crows – So Why Did Zenitsu Get a Sparrow?                   The second chapter of the manga doesn't even reference the fact that demons exist for the first seven pages. Rather than rush to the early series world-building, the series sees Tanjiro stubbornly demand to pay for materials that he could have taken for free, coax Nezuko into a basket, then politely ask for directions. It's clear from the beginning that this story is about the characters more so than any external forces. Using multiple pages on a comical scene of Tanjiro forcefully paying straw for a basket when he could have just as easily assembled a basket off-page helps the audience value Tanjiro more than the journey he's on. The simple premise of killing demons while searching for a cure is ripe for repetitiveness and Demon Slayer largely avoids getting stale thanks to its large pool of interesting, compelling characters. Once the series gathered its core cast, Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, and Inosuke, it introduced the nine Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps as the bulk of the series' supporting cast. To keep the gang's demon-killing missions fresh, the series wisely rotates in different Hashira to join the heroes on various missions. Even this technique should get old after a while, but the Hashira are fascinating characters who are dramatically different from one another. A new Hashira temporarily joining the group creates new character interactions to keep things lively and gives the audience a new character to invest in. RELATED: Demon Slayer: Everything We Know About Shinobu Kocho's Insect Breathing                   Demon Slayer wisely spends more time on who its characters are as opposed to what they can do. Even Kyojuro Rengoku, who spent a good deal of his time in the spotlight literally sleeping, has still become so beloved by fans that an anime-only Rengoku-centric episode was created in response to his popularity. Rengoku's dream flashback gave an insight as to what drove the Flame Hashira, and he got to spend time interacting with Tanjiro and the others before any fighting began so that a bond between the characters could form. Demon Slayer got audiences to care about Rengoku for who he was, rather than just rely on how cool his Flame-Breathing looked. For such a dark premise, Demon Slayer is also surprisingly funny. Humor is a great tool to gain insight into a character, even if the character isn't funny. Laughter and jokes humanize a character just as well as, if not better than, a traumatic past or a long-held dream. If the audience cares about a character, they will care about what happens to them regardless of the story. If the audience is more invested in the plot, the characters become less valuable and anything that happens to them loses a lot of its intended impact. Demon Slayer does such an excellent job of getting its audience heavily invested in its characters so quickly that it almost doesn't matter if the series is a relatively simple one.
