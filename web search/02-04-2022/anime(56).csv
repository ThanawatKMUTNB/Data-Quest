Interest Neko Works Announces Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game on April Fool's Day   posted on 2022-04-01 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    It's April Fool's Day in Japan, so take any announcements with a certain degree of suspicion. Neko Works, the creators of the popular Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages. The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls.     #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The hypothetical game's opening video is streaming on YouTube and includes the theme song ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira.      Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

Interest Neko Works Announces Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game on April Fool's Day   posted on 2022-04-01 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    It's April Fool's Day in Japan, so take any announcements with a certain degree of suspicion. Neko Works, the creators of the popular Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages. The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls.     #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The hypothetical game's opening video is streaming on YouTube and includes the theme song ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira.      Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

Interest Neko Works Announces Inupara: Dogs Paradise Game on April Fool's Day   posted on 2022-04-01 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed.    It's April Fool's Day in Japan, so take any announcements with a certain degree of suspicion. Neko Works, the creators of the popular Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages. The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls.     #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The hypothetical game's opening video is streaming on YouTube and includes the theme song ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira.      Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.    Neko Works' Nekopara Vol. 4: Neko to Patisserie no Noel game released in November 2020 on Steam, and then released on PS4 and Switch in December 2020.    Sekai Project previously ran a Kickstarter campaign in 2017 to fund an original video anime (OVA) based on the game franchise. The OVA launched on Steam in December 2017. The Kickstarter campaign also funded a 12-minute OVA of the prequel game as a stretch goal.    The game series inspired a television anime series that premiered in January 2020 and ran for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.

It's April Fool's Day in Japan, so take any announcements with a certain degree of suspicion. Neko Works, the creators of the popular Nekopara visual novels, announced the Inupara: Dogs Paradise project with an opening song video and character profiles in multiple languages. The team has previously announced a new game on April 1 as a joke, only to later turn the gimmick into a reality, giving audiences NEKOPARA - Catboys Paradise.    Inupara stars six different dog girls each representing a popular breed. The game's protagonist is a college student who shuns the usual social life in favor of spending quality time with his two dogs. One day, he wakes up to find his faithful pooches transformed into girls.     #INUPARA pic.twitter.com/xtxuYTKBhx— NEKO WORKs/NEKOPARA Official (@nekopara_pr) March 31, 2022     The hypothetical game's opening video is streaming on YouTube and includes the theme song ""Inu no Ōta"" by singer Nanahira.      Neko Works announced on November 29 that it is developing a new title in the Nekopara game franchise titled Nekopara After La Vraie Famille. The company also revealed that the game franchise has sold more than 5 million copies worldwide.    Sekai Project released the Nekopara Vol. 1, Nekopara Vol. 2, and Nekopara Vol. 3 games and the Nekopara Vol. 0 fan disc in the U.S. The three games have since been ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

GN 1                      Synopsis:             Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?      Review:         Synopsis:        Not only is 24-year-old Koduka Chiyo wallowing in self-pity after quitting her job, she's also three months behind on her rent. Her 19-year-old landlady proposes an unusual solution: perform favors for her in exchange for the owed money – with the first being that the two sleep together. An arrangement is made where the landlord moves in with Chiyo to make the transfer of these “favors” easier but what is the true reason behind this young landlord's arrangement?     Review:            It's hard not to feel cautious about delving into a manga with such a premise. When a story about a blossoming romance between two characters starts with one of them very directly taking advantage of the other, it has to do a lot of legwork to dig itself out of that hole. Handle that poorly and readers may be left wondering why they should root for these characters by the second chapter. While I don't think that all of the legwork was achieved in this first volume, I was nevertheless surprised at just how subtle yet involved the series is in raising some rather realistic questions about non-heteronormative sexual orientations and how society views them.    A lot of this doesn't come from our main character Chiyo (though there is some bicuriosity starting to bloom there) but rather from the landlord that is placing her in this situation. Despite being younger, there is a clear power imbalance between the two characters and the manga very much treads the line of making sure that the situation doesn't come across as too malicious. A lot of the “favors” being requested range from the mundane to the surprisingly wholesome, and you do get a strong feeling that the landlord isn't going into this arrangement with sex as the primary goal. The manga goes out of its way to highlight that Chiyo's landlord is simply feeling very lonely and a lot of this is borne out of her desperation to fill the void. It is honestly rather refreshing to have a female character that is so blunt about only being into women, but what I found just as fascinating was the occasional snide comment about other sexualities and how people view her.    The manga does not spell out everything for the reader which I appreciate. You get the sense that this was written for an audience that is willing to look past the uncomfortable premise to see where the story actually goes, and what you'll discover beneath that facade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society where their attractions are frowned upon, as well as what it's like to live through a world of microaggressions from people that probably didn't mean to be hurtful but still end up accomplishing just that. That said, I personally think that there are certain lines that should never be crossed regardless of circumstance, and this landlord crossed at least two of them throughout this first volume alone. But surprisingly, I didn't walk away thinking that she was a terrible person, but rather a lonely and misguided soul, which is an accomplishment given my trepidations about the material. If anything, I am interested in seeing where this story goes and if it can pull off the difficult task of having me fully buy into this developing relationship.    However, while I appreciate how the landlord's character is written as she is far and away the most interesting thing about this manga, I can't say the same about our actual named protagonist. She is very much the typical wide-eyed screw-up manga lead that is comedically incapable of taking care of herself despite being the oldest of the two. She definitely means well, and she is willing to step outside her comfort zone for the sake of making up for her own shortcomings, which is endearing. However, the jokes about her incompetence could get a little tiring towards the end. There's nothing necessarily wrong with her character; it's just that this first volume was a little lopsided in its characterization – the bulk of that very subtle character-building went to the landlord whereas Chiyo is clearly meant to counterbalance that as a source of levity. Still, I think that levity could have had more variety towards the end. There are hints towards the end that imply something deeper is beginning to develop – and I hope that goes somewhere – but aside from that, there's just not a lot to Chiyo in this first volume.    Repressed sexuality and sexual desire, non-heterosexual curiosity, societal commentary on different types of sexual orientation – I must admit, none of these are things I was expecting this manga to really touch upon when I originally picked it up to review. While it's impossible to resolve such heavy issues within a single 188-page volume, the fact that there is a clear setup for the story to explore them more deeply made me look at the volume in a more favorable light than I initially had. It is uncomfortable and as I alluded to before, ethical lines like consent or subtle manipulation are muddied more than I think the story really needed to. Unlike the larger societal issues, these more interpersonal dynamics are not treated with the seriousness they deserve, being accompanied by an overall lighter, almost comedic tone. Sometimes it's a nice blend, but mostly they feel incongruous with the at times cartoonish sense of humor the manga has.    This could also be a stylistic issue as the manga will occasionally use simplified character expressions for the sake of brevity. Things like Chiyo's rounded, airheaded expressions are nice and it's not like the art tries too hard to be cute or funny. However, similar to Chiyo's characterization, these don't have a lot of variety to them. That's not true for the whole manga as there are plenty of other instances where the paneling and character framing are being used in subtle ways to elevate the heavier moments. But whenever the style shifts away from that, it can sometimes get jarring and even disappointing to see engaging artwork being undercut by something more typical and repetitive. I hope the balance is improved in future columes.    All in all I Can't Believe I Slept With You! left me pleasantly surprised. It could be because my expectations weren't exactly positive going in, but I do think there are some genuine attempts at leveraging that initial discomfort to talk about some pretty relevant stuff. The mileage on whether or not those conversation starters are worth the shiftier implications of some of our characters' actions will vary from person to person. For me personally though, I think it's a step in the right direction and while I'm not sure if the story will fully redeem itself from the place where it starts, there is enough competency and thoughtfulness on display here that at the very least makes me believe there's a chance that might happen. Guess the manga is forcing me to check out the other volumes to see if my assumptions were right.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B  + A morally questionable lead that's able to generate a surprising amount of sympathy, subtle yet relevant social commentary on sexuality and loneliness − Not much to Chiyo's character for most of the book, humor lacks variety and can clash with more serious moments            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Miyako Miyahara   Full encyclopedia details aboutI Can't Believe I Slept With You!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Aharen-san wa Hakarenai   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring.

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Short, quiet Reina Aharen sits next to Raidō in class. Aharen is not so good at gauging the distance between people (or personal boundaries), and Raidō initially sensed some distance between the two of them. Then one day, when Raidō picked up the eraser that Aharen had dropped, the distance between them suddenly became uncomfortably close. From ""way too distant"" to ""way too close,"" Aharen is simply unpredictable.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is based on  Asato Mizu's romantic comedy manga series and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Romantic comedies about awkward turtles seem to be all the rage lately. Whether they be shy teens or emotionally immature adults, most anime romcoms come with more than a dash of fumbling and socially-stunted quirkiness. Not that I'm complaining; when I first got together with the man who would become my husband, our friend described our flirtation as “the world's most awkward swans honking at each other in distress from across the lake,” so you can probably guess that I find these kinds of series more relatable than love stories between two functional people. Still, as with any genre trends, there are going to be a whole lot of pale imitators to go alongside the creative and original.    Aharen-san wa Hakarenai lies somewhere in that middle ground. A lot of its tropes and plot devices are similar to other current, popular shows, if not lifted outright, but I found myself not minding at all. The chill mood reminded me of Tanaka-san is Always Listless, a series I thoroughly enjoyed, even if it isn't necessarily a romance. Or maybe it was, depending on how you interpreted it. You know, these things are really best left up to audience interpretation. But I digress. Romance or not, Aharen-san's gentle comedy of two deadpan teens on similar wavelengths vibing together will either work for you or it won't.    Unlike a lot of gentle comedies, however, Aharen-san has actual jokes. Gags! Japes! And a lot of them are actually really funny! Humorous! They tickled my funny bone! The nice thing about Aharen and Raidou being so soft-spoken is that it means the humor can't lean on the characters CONSTANTLY YELLING and instead has to find other ways to make a joke land. This made me very happy, because I don't find headaches fun and humor-screeching is the fastest way to give me one. Instead, the physical comedy varies from making me smile to making me laugh out loud, because how could I not at the sight of a tiny girl throwing herself into her tall friend's skull like a purple-haired missile, shortly after pelting him with folded-up slips of paper all day?    So even if Aharen-san isn't the best or most original rom-com on the market, it's sweet and it's certainly funny enough to justify its own existence. Maybe it's because I watched it shortly after I got home from a truly exhausting work week that included two nights away from home, but the chill vibes were truly what I needed at the moment. Perhaps they're what you need too.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               There's nothing egregiously wrong with Aharen-san wa Hakarenai and I can see a lot of people liking it. The characters are cute, and their attempts to better themselves and the problems they face are easy to empathize with.    Raido is one of those kids who had their growth spurt early and has a mean “resting bitch face”  that makes him seem unapproachable. On the other side of the equation, we have the titular Aharen who speaks in an exceedingly soft voice and has trouble understanding personal distance. She's either up in people's personal space or so distant it seems like she's ignoring them. Luckily, the two freshman are keenly aware of their issues and want to overcome them through building a friendship with each other.    Watching them do their best, fail, and try again is cute. I mean, it seems to be the entire premise of the show. Some of the best gags in the show involve nothing more than Aharen shoving food in Raido's face or draping herself across him in an odd pose.    But just because it was cute that doesn't mean it can't be boring. The pacing in Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is painfully slow; the jokes just drag on seemingly forever and more than once I almost skipped ahead to the next scene—and I would, if I hadn't needed to write this review. So, all in all, this is one of those anime I want to like far more than I actually do. I won't be coming back for episode 2, but maybe on some lazy Sunday down the line I'll check out the manga where I control the pace of the story simply by how quickly I turn the pages.        James Beckett  Rating:               Aharen-san wa Hakarenai is one of those shows that I went into with literally know background knowledge of what the show was about, and since my Japanese is a little rusty, the very straightforward title didn't clue me in nearly quick enough. However, once our meek protagonist Raido got done catching the audience up on his meek and lonely existence, he starts desperately trying to make friends with his classmate, the titular Aharen, and it didn't take more than a minute or two for me to figure out the show's main gimmick. In the parlance of Seinfeld, the girl is a low-talker.    This is not unfamiliar territory, necessarily. Outside of classic 90s sitcoms, other anime have explored this exact same trope, and very recently, too. Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}

Komi Can't Communicate has a nearly identical setup, where a protagonist with no social circle to speak of befriends a girl who is so incapable of basic verbal communication that it is genuinely disturbing how no adult in her life has tried to seek professional medical help for the child. The main difference between Komi and Aharen-san, it would seem, is that instead of relying on incredibly boisterous humor and outstanding production values to get its audience's attention, Aharen-san is content to simply have its characters whittle away time while slowly learning how to understand one another. Very slowly.    I'll be honest: While I wanted to like Aharen-san, this premiere was tough to get through. It's not awful by any means, and some of its visual gags actually made me laugh out loud (I specifically loved any time that Aharen would take one of Raido's communication experiments way too literally and proceed to pelt him with paper notes and/or her own skull). However, in between the one or two scenes that elicited a chuckle out of me, I was agonizingly bored.    I totally get the appeal of watching two socially awkward youngsters learn to overcome their communication issues and all that. It's just difficult to become invested in this coming-of-age when both of the lead characters are literally designed to be unmemorable. I simply got nothing out of Raido's exceedingly underwhelming adventures with Aharen, because Raido is a big old nothingburger of a protagonist, and Aharen feels less like a real human person and more like a marketing guy's vision of a perfectly merchandisable plush doll come to life. A veritable Moe Golem. I can see how Aharen-san wa Hakarenai could easily become a crowd-pleasing favorite amongst its target audience, but I will be happy to leave it off of my Spring watchlist.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Aharen is my personal nightmare – someone with very little concept of personal space. She seems to come by it honestly enough; her voice is so astoundingly quiet that she almost has to get in someone's face in order to be heard. She's also carrying a bit of trauma from her middle school days, when she threw herself so wholeheartedly into friendships that she ended up scaring would-be friends away, and she claims to be afraid to repeat the same mistakes now that she's in high school. But…is she really? Because almost the moment Raido, who sits beside her and wants to remedy his own middle school issues, expresses interest, she's all over him with the boundless enthusiasm for physical closeness of your average pup. Even Raido's not quite sure what to make of it.    I can't quite decide if this is meant to be funny, sweet, or just soothing. Possibly my confusion stems from the fact that I found the episode's pacing glacial and the resulting viewing experience somewhat stultifying. I could easily see how Aharen's intended to be appealingly cute – she's physically tiny and has an endearing devotion to making her friendship with Raido work, even if she's not particularly good at it. Besides climbing up him, she also does things like pass/throw him notes while he's in the bathroom and spend hours carefully studying the angles of a crane game so that she can be sure to win plenty of creepy duck-face plushies for him. That he's also trying to win one for her is very sweet, too, and I could see this turning into a low-stakes romance that slice-of-life fans would find very enjoyable. It's clear that Aharen's heart is in the right place even if she doesn't have the experience to back up her good intentions, and really, since Raido doesn't seem to object to her sitting on his lap or draping herself across him to take a nap, we perhaps shouldn't either.    I admit to finding this dull. It could certainly improve from here as Raido learns more about Aharen, and the probable rival character who comes in at the tail end of this episode could shake the pacing up in a positive way. But with lackluster visuals and a dragging progression, I don't think I have the patience to wait this one out.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This is one of those shows where the title tells you everything you need to know going in. Or it would if the powers that be hadn't just left the title romanized for whatever reason. The gist of it is that Aharen-san is indecipherable, inscrutable, and just a god damn weirdo. Pretty much every joke or plot development across this episode is built around that single conceit. There's this tiny, impossibly soft-spoken girl in Raido's new high school class, he can never tell what's going on in her head no matter what he tries, hijinks ensue. It's the kind of premise that's so sparse and simple, it can only get by on pitch perfect execution. While this anime isn't quite there yet, it does, at least, hit the right notes more often than not across this episode.    It all comes down to tone and timing here, and while some segments of this episode don't quite coalesce, when they do it strikes a similar tone to Tanaka-kun is Always Listless, where the humor comes from the combination of laidback tone and absurd circumstances. The best is definitely Raido's escalating attempts to overcome Aharen's impossibly quiet voice through any means possible; notes, lip reading, something called “bone conduction”, and culminating in smoke signals and messenger pigeons. It's all very silly, and made funnier by Raido's unshakable stone face, looking deadly serious through every second of it and never so much as raising his voice.    That more than anything is what makes a lot of these gags work – they'd be ruined if Raido were a shouty straightman overreacting to every eccentricity from Aharen, but are made way funnier with how much he just rolls with it all. It works because both character are established to be awkward weirdos trying to force their way out of their shells, so no matter how bizarre their shenanigans get, they both seems to be having fun and genuinely want to be around each other. It doesn't hurt that Aharen's whole gimmick about misjudging personal space means that to all outside observers these two are already dating – going home together, sharing desks and textbooks, Aharen straight up sitting in Raido's lap when they share lunch, all classic romcom stuff that these two have walked blindly into in a very endearing way. It's all cute as the dickens, and while this joke could wear itself out, I'm hopeful that the series can build upon this solid foundation and make for a quiet, endearing little comedy.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 23  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 23 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            What is the difference between a crack and a break? Something cracked won't necessarily shatter, but if enough pressure is applied, it can be broken beyond repair. That's the point Noé and Vanitas find themselves at in this episode, with Mikhaïl's machinations pushing them into a position they may not be able to recover from. Why he's doing this doesn't feel entirely clear – he says it's because he's trying to regain a memory of when the Vampire of the Blue Moon died, but it seems far more likely that he's simply hoping to see Vanitas and Noé destroy each other because he thrives on the sort of carnivalesque chaos that Charlatan does. He's playing with them like a cat with a small rodent, giving them the illusion of escape or agency when he has no plans to ever let them go.    It's interesting to think of this as the point where the chaos represented by Naenia and Chalatan (and now Mikhaïl) meets the order of Vanitas and Noé. Vanitas has devoted his life to saving vampires from their curses, while Noé has lived mired in the regret of Louis' death and the desire never to see someone die in front of him again. While Vanitas' actions may seem more proactive, it's Noé's that feel more like the heart of their stories, because he's invested in stopping the emotional damage beyond simply rescuing. It's a minor semantic difference, but Noé's “saving” is about fully redeeming the past, while Vanitas' “rescuing” is more about fixing something in the moment. There's no guarantee that the vampires he cures won't just require treatment again, while Noé wants to prevent the need to be rescued in the first place by ensuring that there are no more Louises to suffer.    Whether Mikhaïl is aware of this almost doesn't matter, because mostly he just seems keen on watching the two former friends fight to the death and still have the excuse to kill Dominique. If he can overcome their reason, he can triumph, and when Noé attacks Vanitas, mouth wide open, it looks like Mikhaïl might succeed. But while Vanitas may have lost himself (and nothing says that more than him injecting the Chasseurs' potion), Noé is only attacking out of the desire to protect Domi, meaning that he's got a clearer head than his friend. It's not that he's not invested in what he's doing and more that he's acting with purpose outside of himself and of his own volition; to hear Mikhaïl talk, it sounds like Vanitas is under the influence of their late parent and making decisions based solely on that rather than on any desire to kill Noé he might harbor. In fact, if Vanitas was thinking clearly, it's unlikely that he'd want to kill Noé, because saving vampires has been his entire reason for being in this series from episode one. It's his hurt and the younger version of himself that dwells in his soul that's acting now, not Vanitas as we've come to know him.    Nothing illustrates that better than Domi's conversation with her past self. She's trying to figure out a way to act that will save Noé and seems willing to die if that will do it, but her younger self questions the validity of her present self's actions. That her twin brother, the lost Louis, also appears to live inside her really speaks to how conflicted she is and how sad she's been, trying to make up for what she sees as her failing as his sister (i. e. surviving) while also wanting Noé to live on. What she doesn't appear to realize is that she's important to Noé too, and that he's not interested in losing anyone else – not Vanitas and not her. It's a bit like everyone is underestimating him, seeing his unwillingness to kill as a weakness rather than something he can turn into a strength, which is what he's realizing himself at the end of the episode.    Everyone in this story is trying to cope with their own tragedies. Even if two of them can be grouped under the heading of “Louis,” it's different for each of the characters. Mikhaïl may be trying to take advantage of that, when Noé cracks the funhouse mirror that's been reflecting his tragedy back at him, he opens the possibility of shattering the mirror completely and finally moving forward, because maybe the real tragedy is how no one – not him, not Vanitas, not Jeanne, and not Domi – has been able to put the past behind them. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 23  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 23 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            What is the difference between a crack and a break? Something cracked won't necessarily shatter, but if enough pressure is applied, it can be broken beyond repair. That's the point Noé and Vanitas find themselves at in this episode, with Mikhaïl's machinations pushing them into a position they may not be able to recover from. Why he's doing this doesn't feel entirely clear – he says it's because he's trying to regain a memory of when the Vampire of the Blue Moon died, but it seems far more likely that he's simply hoping to see Vanitas and Noé destroy each other because he thrives on the sort of carnivalesque chaos that Charlatan does. He's playing with them like a cat with a small rodent, giving them the illusion of escape or agency when he has no plans to ever let them go.    It's interesting to think of this as the point where the chaos represented by Naenia and Chalatan (and now Mikhaïl) meets the order of Vanitas and Noé. Vanitas has devoted his life to saving vampires from their curses, while Noé has lived mired in the regret of Louis' death and the desire never to see someone die in front of him again. While Vanitas' actions may seem more proactive, it's Noé's that feel more like the heart of their stories, because he's invested in stopping the emotional damage beyond simply rescuing. It's a minor semantic difference, but Noé's “saving” is about fully redeeming the past, while Vanitas' “rescuing” is more about fixing something in the moment. There's no guarantee that the vampires he cures won't just require treatment again, while Noé wants to prevent the need to be rescued in the first place by ensuring that there are no more Louises to suffer.    Whether Mikhaïl is aware of this almost doesn't matter, because mostly he just seems keen on watching the two former friends fight to the death and still have the excuse to kill Dominique. If he can overcome their reason, he can triumph, and when Noé attacks Vanitas, mouth wide open, it looks like Mikhaïl might succeed. But while Vanitas may have lost himself (and nothing says that more than him injecting the Chasseurs' potion), Noé is only attacking out of the desire to protect Domi, meaning that he's got a clearer head than his friend. It's not that he's not invested in what he's doing and more that he's acting with purpose outside of himself and of his own volition; to hear Mikhaïl talk, it sounds like Vanitas is under the influence of their late parent and making decisions based solely on that rather than on any desire to kill Noé he might harbor. In fact, if Vanitas was thinking clearly, it's unlikely that he'd want to kill Noé, because saving vampires has been his entire reason for being in this series from episode one. It's his hurt and the younger version of himself that dwells in his soul that's acting now, not Vanitas as we've come to know him.    Nothing illustrates that better than Domi's conversation with her past self. She's trying to figure out a way to act that will save Noé and seems willing to die if that will do it, but her younger self questions the validity of her present self's actions. That her twin brother, the lost Louis, also appears to live inside her really speaks to how conflicted she is and how sad she's been, trying to make up for what she sees as her failing as his sister (i. e. surviving) while also wanting Noé to live on. What she doesn't appear to realize is that she's important to Noé too, and that he's not interested in losing anyone else – not Vanitas and not her. It's a bit like everyone is underestimating him, seeing his unwillingness to kill as a weakness rather than something he can turn into a strength, which is what he's realizing himself at the end of the episode.    Everyone in this story is trying to cope with their own tragedies. Even if two of them can be grouped under the heading of “Louis,” it's different for each of the characters. Mikhaïl may be trying to take advantage of that, when Noé cracks the funhouse mirror that's been reflecting his tragedy back at him, he opens the possibility of shattering the mirror completely and finally moving forward, because maybe the real tragedy is how no one – not him, not Vanitas, not Jeanne, and not Domi – has been able to put the past behind them. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.

Case Study of Vanitas Season 2 Episode 23  by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 23 of The Case Study of Vanitas (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4            What is the difference between a crack and a break? Something cracked won't necessarily shatter, but if enough pressure is applied, it can be broken beyond repair. That's the point Noé and Vanitas find themselves at in this episode, with Mikhaïl's machinations pushing them into a position they may not be able to recover from. Why he's doing this doesn't feel entirely clear – he says it's because he's trying to regain a memory of when the Vampire of the Blue Moon died, but it seems far more likely that he's simply hoping to see Vanitas and Noé destroy each other because he thrives on the sort of carnivalesque chaos that Charlatan does. He's playing with them like a cat with a small rodent, giving them the illusion of escape or agency when he has no plans to ever let them go.    It's interesting to think of this as the point where the chaos represented by Naenia and Chalatan (and now Mikhaïl) meets the order of Vanitas and Noé. Vanitas has devoted his life to saving vampires from their curses, while Noé has lived mired in the regret of Louis' death and the desire never to see someone die in front of him again. While Vanitas' actions may seem more proactive, it's Noé's that feel more like the heart of their stories, because he's invested in stopping the emotional damage beyond simply rescuing. It's a minor semantic difference, but Noé's “saving” is about fully redeeming the past, while Vanitas' “rescuing” is more about fixing something in the moment. There's no guarantee that the vampires he cures won't just require treatment again, while Noé wants to prevent the need to be rescued in the first place by ensuring that there are no more Louises to suffer.    Whether Mikhaïl is aware of this almost doesn't matter, because mostly he just seems keen on watching the two former friends fight to the death and still have the excuse to kill Dominique. If he can overcome their reason, he can triumph, and when Noé attacks Vanitas, mouth wide open, it looks like Mikhaïl might succeed. But while Vanitas may have lost himself (and nothing says that more than him injecting the Chasseurs' potion), Noé is only attacking out of the desire to protect Domi, meaning that he's got a clearer head than his friend. It's not that he's not invested in what he's doing and more that he's acting with purpose outside of himself and of his own volition; to hear Mikhaïl talk, it sounds like Vanitas is under the influence of their late parent and making decisions based solely on that rather than on any desire to kill Noé he might harbor. In fact, if Vanitas was thinking clearly, it's unlikely that he'd want to kill Noé, because saving vampires has been his entire reason for being in this series from episode one. It's his hurt and the younger version of himself that dwells in his soul that's acting now, not Vanitas as we've come to know him.    Nothing illustrates that better than Domi's conversation with her past self. She's trying to figure out a way to act that will save Noé and seems willing to die if that will do it, but her younger self questions the validity of her present self's actions. That her twin brother, the lost Louis, also appears to live inside her really speaks to how conflicted she is and how sad she's been, trying to make up for what she sees as her failing as his sister (i. e. surviving) while also wanting Noé to live on. What she doesn't appear to realize is that she's important to Noé too, and that he's not interested in losing anyone else – not Vanitas and not her. It's a bit like everyone is underestimating him, seeing his unwillingness to kill as a weakness rather than something he can turn into a strength, which is what he's realizing himself at the end of the episode.    Everyone in this story is trying to cope with their own tragedies. Even if two of them can be grouped under the heading of “Louis,” it's different for each of the characters. Mikhaïl may be trying to take advantage of that, when Noé cracks the funhouse mirror that's been reflecting his tragedy back at him, he opens the possibility of shattering the mirror completely and finally moving forward, because maybe the real tragedy is how no one – not him, not Vanitas, not Jeanne, and not Domi – has been able to put the past behind them. Like Vanitas' hourglass, all the sand is in one section. Maybe it's time to flip it over and start moving.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022, Mar 19-25   by Daniel DeLorme, Mar 30th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022, Mar 19-25   by Daniel DeLorme, Mar 30th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022, Mar 19-25   by Daniel DeLorme, Mar 30th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally.

If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Weekly Ranking homepage / archives    ",positive,en,{}

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   Don't forget to head over to Your Score to rate the episodes you've watched this week   Episode Rankings for the week of March 19-25 Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24         Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.  ",positive,en,{}

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time.

I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout Episode 12  by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Fantasy Bishōjo Juniku Ojisan to ?                     Community score: 4.2            My god they actually did it. No, they didn't commit to Tachibana and Jinguuji as a trashboi OTP, but for the first time in possibly the entire show, they actually let our central couple have a sincere moment of connection and vulnerability. And they even managed to extricate that annoying brainwashing part without it getting in the way of the important stuff! Good on ya, show.    Though my (incredibly biased) favorite part of this finale is definitely Schwartz von Lichtenstein Lohengramm of all people having to be the emotionally mature adult in the situation, and straight-up tell Jinguuji that there's nothing wrong or shameful about showing he cares about Tachibana. This boy may be a dipstick in SAO cosplay, but even he knows that It's important to tell your friends how much they mean to you, because otherwise they'll never know. You know you've got some serious emotional hang-ups when a chuuni high-schooler is your relationship counselor.    It's a good thing Jinguuji regains his super strength here, because it turns out he's got a whole airport of baggage he's been carrying around. We'd seen bits and pieces of his past and a less-than-happy family life, but here we see just how deep that all burrowed. He was raised not just in a strict and traditional household, but one that sought to stomp out any perceived weakness or vulnerability in Jinguuji as a child, teaching him that relying on others was shameful, and to remain stoic no matter what. It's a toxic mindset that he only barely escaped thanks to Tachibana's friendship, but it's left him all but incapable of being emotionally honest or vulnerable with anyone. But with the help of Love Doctor Schwartz, and with his only real friendship on the line, he's finally able to open up.    By which I mean he opens up the entire Hoover Dam and floods millions of metric tons of emotions on Tachibana all at once. It's astounding just how long his Friendship Rant goes on without pause, and even more impressive that it so masterfully straddles the line between sincere sentiment and the sardonic humor the show is built upon. You really do get the sense that all the little quirks to Tachibana's personality, from mundane things like how he likes animals, to how much he considers others around him, are important enough to Jinguuji that he's got them all committed to memory. The romantic subtext there is obvious to everyone except Jinguuji himself, but of course we can't actually resolve that, so instead Tachibana just blushes into another dimension at the onslaught of affection. Thus their initial game of Gay Chicken is back in full force, ready to drive both these idiots crazy until they finally admit their feelings.    It's a great punchline to go out on, and only slightly hampered by the need to stretch out the denouement to lead into a potential second season. Not that I'd be unhappy if a sequel happened – one of my biggest disappointments with the show is how its extended cast has largely been left by the wayside, so the idea of Yggie and the other characters all venturing out on their own journeys with the promise of encountering our heroes again is a good one. I'd just prefer if the show hadn't spent quite so long on what amounts to “and their adventures continued!” coda.    On the whole though, Total Fantasy Knockout has been a fun time. It's had its weaker episodes and clunky jokes, but at its best this series could be a crass and loud blast.  I just wish it had been at its best more often than it was, because there are a couple episodes that are total riots, balancing the various characters and punchlines perfectly, while more than a few averaged out to “okay” after meandering around with weak gags for far too long. As it stands it's still a solid comedy, and one of the more entertaining isekai of this season, but I can't give it a particularly strong recommendation. I can, however, hope it does well enough that they actually give us a full Schwartz spin-off.

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by Rebecca Silverman, Mar 26th 2022       Orochi: The Perfect Edition GN 1                     Synopsis:             Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?      Review:         Synopsis:        Mysterious, not-quite-human Orochi has fateful encounters with two different families: two sisters fated to become ugly once they turn eighteen, and a woman scarred by her difficult past who can't seem to escape tragedy. Will Orochi's powers help these people? Or is the human heart the one thing that a supernatural being like her cannot understand?     Review:            Orochi is a mysterious, clearly supernatural woman who serves as our guide through the two stories in this volume, a little bit like how Golden Age DC horror comics House of Mystery and The House of Secrets had Cain and Abel fill a similar function. But in Kazuo Umezz's variation on the theme, Orochi is a participant in the horrors, and in one case the instigator of it all, albeit an unwitting one. Interestingly there is still an anthology feel to the series, largely brought about by the fact that this volume, the first in Viz's “Perfect Edition” releases of the work, contains two separate stories. In Bones, the second, longer story, Orochi's attempt to give a woman with a miserable life the happiness she lost backfires horribly in a case of ""be careful what you wish for,"" while in the shorter Sisters Orochi finds herself living with two sisters who fear the impending loss of their beauty when they turn eighteen due to a family curse.    It's hard to say if one story is better than the other, because both are strong in their own ways. There's more of a delicious irony to Sisters that's missing from Bones, which takes a more traditional horror path, replete with gore and body horror. It might almost be worth categorizing the former as terror (psychological) and the latter as horror (visceral) for their very different storylines and approaches to the genre. The action of Sisters takes place primarily in the heads of sisters Rumi and Emi – they believe that their family suffers from a curse that makes the women turn ugly upon reaching their eighteenth birthday. Orochi stumbles into their home one rainy night, and uses her powers to convince the girls that she's their new live-in maid by simply touching her hand to their foreheads. Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Once in the house, Orochi quickly becomes fond of the sisters and decides that she'll stay and watch over them, our first indication that she's a more benevolent entity than the genre of the story she's in would suggest. In fact, Orochi herself has very little to do with the events that quickly begin to unfold around Emi and Rumi – she never plants an idea in their heads with her powers after the initial one to gain entry to their house. The sisters, as it turns out, are perfectly capable of destroying themselves with their fear of no longer being beautiful and their jealousy that one of them may be adopted and thus exempt from the family curse. This allows us to wonder whether the curse itself truly exists or if it's brought on by the ugly thoughts and emotions raised by the certainty that eighteen is the end date for their beauty – they believe it, and so it becomes true, one way or another. It's a statement on the obsession with youthful good looks and beauty standards, as well as how those can warp people internally, and we could read it as also being an indictment on cultures that expect or pressure their women to marry by a certain age; one of the sisters has a boyfriend who becomes tangled up in their family issues.    Bones, which is twice the length of its predecessor, warps the traditional Cinderella story, but in a slow enough way that its true nature doesn't become fully clear until the end. It follows Chie, a girl whose mother died in childbirth and whose stepmother treated her cruelly. After a terrible girlhood, Chie finally finds happiness with Saburo, only to nearly lose him in an accident. Although he recovers, he dies shortly after, and Chie is inconsolable. In this story, Orochi is working as a nurse at a local hospital, and she feels so badly for Chie and Saburo that she resolves to use her powers to bring Saburo back from the dead – and if you've ever read any horror fiction, you know that that's a spectacularly bad idea. More Those Who Seek Forgiveness (an early Laurell K. Hamilton short story from her collection Strange Candy) than The Monkey's Paw, Saburo's return quickly devolves into something more horrible than Orochiever could have imagined, even as she remains devoted to trying to fix the situation. While Sisters involves self-harm, Bones is all about the body horror, with decomposing corpses and death by either bugs or suffocation (or possibly both) on the table. It's a more complex story, but also a bit less interesting in that it lacks the ironic elements of Sisters and feels rather more traditional of its genre. Orochi's more active role in the plot is one of its best aspects, since it's less the humans who need to be careful what they're wishing for and more Orochi as she learns some hard facts about human nature, which is far more terrible than even Emi and Rumi showed her.    Both stories do a very good job of getting across the sense that Orochi (named for a mythical eight-headed, eight-tailed Japanese dragon) really does mean well – it's just that she's not human, and that makes it difficult for her to understand human nature. Her help is the worst sort of hindrance, and it's made tragic by the fact that her intentions are always, always good. With art that's easier on the eyes than Junji Ito's in that it's less likely to turn your stomach (although it is every bit as affective), this is a solid work. It may not be as visceral as some other horror manga, but it does still make its points, and Orochi herself is an excellent method of doing so. We all know that humans are usually the real monsters in the world – and nothing gets that point across than having an actual supernatural “monster” be the one to realize it.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B+ Art : B+  + Solid horror and terror, Orochi as a character works to emphasize both. − Can be a little too on-the-nose at times, Bones drags a bit.            discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Kazuo Umezu   Full encyclopedia details aboutOrochi (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!
