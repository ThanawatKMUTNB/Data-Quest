Interest Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   posted on 2022-03-31 23:23 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge           After a cryptic announcement that he was changing his name to ""Bonsoir Ikuhara,"" the Utena and Penguindrum director revealed he's participating in a new music project. Ikuhara is teaming up with Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.       The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars.    Ikuhara first announced the name change on his social media accounts with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

Interest Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   posted on 2022-03-31 23:23 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge           After a cryptic announcement that he was changing his name to ""Bonsoir Ikuhara,"" the Utena and Penguindrum director revealed he's participating in a new music project. Ikuhara is teaming up with Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.       The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars.    Ikuhara first announced the name change on his social media accounts with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

Interest Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   posted on 2022-03-31 23:23 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge           After a cryptic announcement that he was changing his name to ""Bonsoir Ikuhara,"" the Utena and Penguindrum director revealed he's participating in a new music project. Ikuhara is teaming up with Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.       The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars.    Ikuhara first announced the name change on his social media accounts with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November. Gemdrops released the Laid-Back Camp - Virtual - Lake Motosu (Yurucamp Virtual Camp Motosuko-hen) VR game in March 2021, and released the Laid-Back Camp - Virtual - Fumoto Campsite (Yurucamp Virtual Camp Fumoto Camp Jō-hen) VR game on April 8.

News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November. Gemdrops released the Laid-Back Camp - Virtual - Lake Motosu (Yurucamp Virtual Camp Motosuko-hen) VR game in March 2021, and released the Laid-Back Camp - Virtual - Fumoto Campsite (Yurucamp Virtual Camp Fumoto Camp Jō-hen) VR game on April 8.

I'm glad to have Arifureta back looking better than ever.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.

Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. The game acts as an accelerat...                    game review          2 comments       Mary Skelter Finale   Oct 13, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Mary Skelter Finale's twistedly imaginative imagery are sure to sit with any player long after they've put it down. ― Of all the JRPG/visual novel hybrids I've had a chance to play, Mary Skelter Finale is by far the most memorable of the considerably homogenous bunch. Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. It perfectly captures a certain branch of gamer culture in its dialogue, visual styles, and gameplay, making for a unique experience that absolutely should not be missed.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

The real question is whether or not it is actually any fun to play, now, and the answer is: “…kind of? Sometimes. But it's bad on purpose, I swear!” ― Yoko Taro's recent transformation from cult JRPG auteur to something of a fandom icon has been a very welcome surprise.

This is a game that throws you head-first into the depths of its myriad gameplay systems with only a half-inflated life vest while telling you that you need to learn to swim right now. ― SaGa Frontier is a game whose original release could best be described as unfortunate.

More importantly, I was never bored. There was always something more to see each time I set out on an expedition. ― By the end of 1999 Pokémon Snap was the sixth best-selling Nintendo 64 title of the year and by the console's retirement it was its 11th highest-selling title of all time. ...                    game review          1 comment       Monster Hunter Rise   Apr 15, 03:00 1 comment                 games    Monster Hunter: Rise offers a few new features like rideable monsters, grappling hooks, and customizable weapon arts. But will it be the knockout game players have been waiting for? ― Up until now, the Monster Hunter series has mainly existed in my periphery.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream. Todd Ciolek has the lowdown on every title in this collection. ― Last year's NES Classic Edition was a finely crafted piece of nostalgia: an authentically miniature Nintendo Entertainment System with thirty built-in games, ranging from enduring classics to dispo...                    game review          25 comments       Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite   2017 Sep 27, 00:00 25 comments                 games    Several changes have been made to this fighting game's new installment, but not all of them are for the better. Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes. Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular.

Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies.

They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. The game acts as an accelerat...                    game review          2 comments       Mary Skelter Finale   Oct 13, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Mary Skelter Finale's twistedly imaginative imagery are sure to sit with any player long after they've put it down. ― Of all the JRPG/visual novel hybrids I've had a chance to play, Mary Skelter Finale is by far the most memorable of the considerably homogenous bunch. Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. It perfectly captures a certain branch of gamer culture in its dialogue, visual styles, and gameplay, making for a unique experience that absolutely should not be missed. The games feature a brash comedic style, absurdly degenerate action,...                    game review          10 comments       Everyday♪ Today's MENU for EMIYA Family   Jun 13, 00:00 10 comments                 games    With its sparse content, performance issues, and tepid dialogue, Everyday♪ Today's Menu for Emiya Family is a bad game even by the standards of low-budget anime tie-ins. ― With its sparse content, performance issues, and tepid dialogue, Everyday♪ Today's MENU for EMIYA Family is a bad game even by the standards of low-budget anime tie-ins.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo. While this 2021 edition visually bears little resemblance t...                    game review          3 comments       Spirit Hunter: NG   May 23, 00:00 3 comments                 games    Aksys Games' release of Spirit Hunter: NG is the second in Experience, Inc.'s Spirit Hunter horror visual novel franchise, serving up over 15 hours of creeping horrors. ― Aksys Games' release of Spirit Hunter: NG is the second in Experience, Inc.'s Spirit Hunter horror visual novel franchise, serving up over 15 hours of creeping horrors.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

May 18, 02:00 15 comments                 games    Okay, so we've established that Nier Replicant earns top marks for its aesthetics. The real question is whether or not it is actually any fun to play, now, and the answer is: “…kind of? Sometimes. But it's bad on purpose, I swear!” ― Yoko Taro's recent transformation from cult JRPG auteur to something of a fandom icon has been a very welcome surprise. To be clear, Taro is not the sole reason for the ...                    game review          9 comments       SaGa Frontier Remastered   May 16, 00:00 9 comments                 games    I do not exaggerate when I say that SaGa Frontier is extremely rude. This is a game that throws you head-first into the depths of its myriad gameplay systems with only a half-inflated life vest while telling you that you need to learn to swim right now. ― SaGa Frontier is a game whose original release could best be described as unfortunate. It came not long after Final Fantasy VII had made many new p...                    game review          7 comments       Another Eden: The Cat Beyond Time and Space   May 11, 00:05 7 comments                 games    Another Eden is the latest offering from members of theChrono Trigger team It has a high pedigree and some great quality-of-life features, but is it a loving tribute to those original Squaresoft titles, or just a half-baked shadow? ― It's been a long time since I sat down with a gacha game the way I have over the last couple of weeks.

More importantly, I was never bored.

But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action! Which of these two new games should you play? Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream. Todd Ciolek has the lowdown on every title in this collection. ― Last year's NES Classic Edition was a finely crafted piece of nostalgia: an authentically miniature Nintendo Entertainment System with thirty built-in games, ranging from enduring classics to dispo...                    game review          25 comments       Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite   2017 Sep 27, 00:00 25 comments                 games    Several changes have been made to this fighting game's new installment, but not all of them are for the better. Dustin Bailey gets into it. ― The new story mode in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite has all the characters trapped in a pair of worlds awkwardly smashed together out of pieces from their respective universes. Marvel's AIM laboratories host not only MODOK, but also the BOWs of Resident Evil, smu...

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. The game acts as an accelerat...                    game review          2 comments       Mary Skelter Finale   Oct 13, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Mary Skelter Finale's twistedly imaginative imagery are sure to sit with any player long after they've put it down. ― Of all the JRPG/visual novel hybrids I've had a chance to play, Mary Skelter Finale is by far the most memorable of the considerably homogenous bunch. Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company? Was it the Neo Geo, which delivered arcade-perfect games at home for just two hundred dollars per cartridge? Was it the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a well-made and vastly underappreciated handheld syst...                    game review          7 comments       My Hero: One's Justice (PlayStation 4)   2018 Oct 24, 23:43 7 comments                 games    My Hero One’s Justice captures the essence of its source material, and offers a fine experience for anyone looking to cross blows as their My Hero Academia favorites. ― The anime franchise tie-in brawler is a venerable gaming institution, with Bandai Namco having published similar efforts for franchises like Naruto and Dragon Ball in the past. On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together? Daryl Surat scours the wasteland to find out. ― The last few years have marked a surge in popularity among English-language fans of both Sega's long-running Yakuza series of videogames as well as—to a lesser extent—the formative trope-establishing Sh...                    game review          7 comments       Mega Man 11   2018 Oct  2, 23:36 7 comments                 anime    It's Mega Man's big chance for a comeback, and it's not what some fans might expect. We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

Sam Leach finds out if the result is fun enough to be worth a look for casual or experienced players. ― I'm hesitant to use the word “ambitious” to describe One Piece: World Seeker, because if we're comparing it to anything beyond licensed anime games, it looks like a half-baked cookie-cutter rendition of a...                    game review          1 comment       Fate/Extella Link (Switch)   2019 Mar 24, 02:00 1 comment                 games    The sequel to the Dynasty Warriors-style Fate game Fate/Extella is here, loaded with new characters and costumes - but is it a step up from the last one, or just more of the same? ― Fate/Extella Link is set in the same general continuity as the past games in the Fate/Extra series--Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC, and Fate Extella.

Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s.

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending.

Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                           game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken.""

Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs).

The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action! Which of these two new games should you play? Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...                    game review          21 comments       Super NES Classic Edition   2017 Oct  5, 22:00 21 comments                 games    With heaps of 16-bit classics to choose from including the never-before-released Star Fox 2, the Super NES Classic is a retro gamer's dream.
