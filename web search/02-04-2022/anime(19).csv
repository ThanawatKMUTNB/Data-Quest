Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.

ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising.

But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest.

Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums.

Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate!

Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements.

02-04-2022,anime,1,0,,RIP E3 - This Week in Games - Anime News Network:SEA,"      This Week in Games RIP E3  by Heidi Kemps, Apr  1st 2022         Hey everyone, it's April Fools’ Day! Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!

Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below.

02-04-2022,anime,1,0,,RIP E3 - This Week in Games - Anime News Network:SEA,"      Hey everyone, it's April Fools’ Day! Unfortunately, I have to submit this the day before April 1st, which means that by the time you read this, every company out there is going to be yukkin’ it up with their pranks, and I won't be able to cover any of the good ones until next week. It's already April 1st in Japan, though, and a few folks overseas put their jokes up at the stroke of midnight JST. So far, the most interesting of the JP April Fools’ “jokes” isn't really a joke at all, but an interest check.   This is Prayer to Death, a 1v1 Virtual-On-like third-person head-to-head combat game by Arika. Arika has been hinting about working on a new, original project for a while in-between doing contract work for other companies like Tetris 99 and Chocobo GP, and Prayer to Death looks to be that game. Unveiling new projects on April 1st is becoming something of a tradition for Arika: they first showed off what would become Fighting EX Layer as a proof-of-concept on April Fools Day a few years back, then announced the mobile version of FEXL on April 1st a few years later, and then the Switch version of FEXL last year, so this is most certainly a real thing. It is, however, not a sure thing. Much like with FEXL's initial reveal, Arika's putting Prayer to Death out there to gauge reaction and see if it's worth continuing to develop. This kind of game is fairly niche, and a small dev/publisher like Arika has to be very choosy about where its resources go. But if you like what you see here, commenting on Arika's Twitter or Youtube and RTing the trailer will help show your enthusiasm and interest. I'd like to see Prayer to Death happen! So let's get on with this week's no-foolin’-at-all news! E3 2022 IS DEAD, LIKE, EXTREMELY DEAD Right as I was prepping the opening, news started circulating on Twitter that companies and certain media/influencer types had received word that the digital version of E3 2022 – the replacement for the physical, in-person E3 – has also been cancelled, which… if you've been reading this column for a while or even have just been watching the way game announcements are disseminated nowadays, is hardly surprising. What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing.

What is surprising (and somewhat annoying) is that the Entertainment Software Association – the industry lobby that funds the show – is still trying to convince everyone else (and possibly themselves) that E3 2023 is a thing that is going to happen. Their official statement: “We will devote all our energy and resources to delivering a revitalized physical and digital E3 experience next summer. Whether enjoyed from the show floor or your favorite devices, the 2023 showcase will bring the community, media, and industry back together in an all-new format and interactive experience… We look forward to presenting E3 to fans around the world live from Los Angeles in 2023."" I don't think shitcanning the 2022 show is going to raise any confidence among potential exhibitors or attendees of a theoretical 2023 event, guys. But hey, if you want to waste money attempting to keep E3 on life support instead of using it to oppose game preservation efforts, be my guest. Meanwhile, Geoff Keighley was circling above the dying E3 2022, ready on social media to swoop down upon its corpse with self-promotion the moment it collapsed.   Join us this June for @SummerGameFest - an industry wide celebration of video games, featuring a spectacular live kickoff show hosted by @geoffkeighley Sign up at https://t.co/1ZwAhZ66ie to be the first to know details. pic.twitter.com/P2eLRISqfQ— Summer Game Fest 2022 (@summergamefest) March 31, 2022    Look forward to that, I guess? ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD 2 OR WHATEVER IT'LL WIND UP BEING CALLED IS DELAYED TO 2023 Well… yeah, that header says it all. Zelda BotW2 isn't happening this year. Here's the official announcement, straight from Epona's mouth:   You heard the man. No Zelda until Spring 2023. Personally, I want developers to not be overworked and under constant pressure, so I'm cool with this. Look at it this way: you've now got more time to enjoy that enormous backlog of games you have (something that might get even bigger soon with a certain Sony announcement). But because everything is a conspiracy theory nowadays, there's a group of folks who believe that this is Nintendo covertly announcing a Switch 2/Switch Pro for Spring 2023. There is some historical precedent for this: Both Twilight Princess and the original Breath of the Wild were delayed, then revealed to be launching on Nintendo's new-at-the-time platform alongside the system it was originally planned for. I have serious doubts about this, but it's not completely implausible… just highly unlikely, seeing as how the Switch is still doing very well in its various forms. SONY ANNOUNCES ITS GAMEPASS COMPETITOR SERVICE TO A RESOUNDING “meh” The rumors circulating that Sony would detail its answer to Microsoft's extremely popular Xbox GamePass service were spot-on. Earlier this week, Sony unveiled the particulars of its new service, which merges PlayStation Plus with PlayStation Now and adds a few other benefits… to a general reaction of “that's all?”   All-new PlayStation Plus launches in June with three flexible membership options.First details: https://t.co/2KXcEp7XWs pic.twitter.com/jAU9Do3CfE— PlayStation (@PlayStation) March 29, 2022    The new, three-tiered service operates as follows: PS Plus Essentials is the same as the current PS Plus, meaning you get the usual 2 free games a month, cloud saves, online multiplayer, and so on, and it costs the same as before. PS Plus Extra is $14.99 USD a month ($99.99 USD for a year) and offers you a library of downloadable PS4 and PS5 games, mostly proven hits from across the consoles’ lifespan. The final tier, PS Plus Premium, lets you download or stream PS1/PS2/PSP games, stream PS3 and PS4 games, and offers exclusive demo version of games. Premium is $17.99 per month, or $119.99 for a year. (It should be noted that in markets where game streaming isn't available, this tier will be called Deluxe and offer exclusively downloadable content instead.) Yeah, this sounds a lot more like Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pass than the Xbox Game Pass, doesn't it? While you could argue that tying everything into a tiered PS Plus subscription is less confusing than the sometimes-separate-unless-you-buy-Ultimate Xbox Live and Xbox GamePass, if you don't play online much then you've still got the option to enjoy GamePass at a cheaper price. The other big thing is that Sony's indicated that new releases will not be available on this service – a stark contrast to Microsoft, who have not shied away from putting heavy hitters like Halo Infinite on GamePass day one. The ability to access a massive catalog of both brand-spanking-new and old titles is what's helped make GamePass so successful. Sony's just looking obnoxiously stubborn and protective. No, you will not get to hang out with Mad Dad Kratos unless you pay the traditional 59.99, cheapskate! Still, Sony's library of old games is undeniably excellent, and if they can offer me the ability to download and play rare and expensive PS1/2 obscurities at a good price (and with acceptable emulation quality) then I could see myself tempted to throw a couple extra bucks their way. But I'm definitely in the minority, so I think the middle (Extra) tier is likely to be the most popular choice for the masses… but a lot of folks might just ignore the additions entirely and stick with the standard PS Plus. I guess we'll see how it'll play out. Now, when do we get free Crunchyroll with our PS Plus subs, Sony…? NEW GAME+ EXPO DELIVERS SOME PLEASANT SURPRISES It's that time again for niche publishers like Idea Factory, Aksys Games, NIS, Natsume, and Inti Creates to show off what they've got in store for later this year! While New Game+ conjures up images of RPGs, there was a lot of variety in the types of games showcased: scrolling action games, visual novels, dungeon crawlers, action-RPGs, open-world adventures, just a nice little mix of stuff. Let's have a look at what was shown.   Pocky & Rocky Re-shrined is one I'm super excited for. It might look like a simple remake of the SNES game at first glance, but there's a lot more going on and I am here for all of it. It's nailed down for a June 24th release date on Switch and PS4.   One of the most pleasant surprises of the show was NIS America announcing they've licensed Kamiwaza: Way of the Thief for Switch and PS4. This is a game developed by Acquire, the folks behind the criminally underappreciated Way of the Samurai open-world games, but instead of an honor-driven samurai, you're a desperate career thief attempting to save his daughter from illness by doing what you do best. This is a remake of a PS2 title of the same name that never made the voyage overseas, and if you've played the Way of the Samurai titles you'll have a good idea of what to expect. And if you haven't played Way of the Samurai, you still might want to check Kamiwaza out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.   Also coming from NIS is a compilation of Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure and La Pucelle: Ragnarok… two games which weren't actually published by NIS when they first released in North America, since NIS America didn't exist. But now they do! Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana is also coming to PS5, which seems a bit unnecessary… but hey, if more people play it, that's swell!   Azure Striker Gunvolt 3 now has a global release date of June 28th on Switch. Also, Keiji Inafune has emerged from hiding to oversee its development. Will this be his successful parole appeal from the prison of public perception? Also, the super-adorbs kemono shooter Horgihugh and Friends will launch June 16th on Switch. June's lookin’ like a pretty swell month for retro-style action fans.   Hey, how about a stylish Japan-themed, sprite-based roguelike before you get into the action stuff? Here's Samurai Bringer, launching next month on the 21st of April on PS4/Switch/PC via Playism. There's also Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi, a hardcore dungeon-crawling RPG published by Aksys and developed by Wizardry-like specialty developer Experience Inc. The PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC versions are already out, but if you must have Undernauts on the most advanced hardware available, then you'll be good to go this summer.   Idea Factory International had a nice surprise in Dusk Diver 2 for Switch. This is a Taiwan-developed action game from JFI Games. If I'm not mistaken, this might be IFI's first offering that wasn't originally published by their Japanese branch. I'm hoping this will be a sign that they're open to publishing more games from China and Taiwan, because dang, this looks pretty rad! If you can't wait for the console release, both this and its prequel Dusk Diver are currently available on Steam for PC.   Speaking of IFI, they're revisiting their first published otome game release with Amnesia: Memories on the Switch. I enjoyed this game quite a bit when I played through it a few years back, and since the audience for these sorts of games has grown since then, I hope it'll find more fans. Later in the year we'll get Amnesia: Later X Crowd, a compilation of two “fandiscs” that were originally released for the PSP. (Are they considered fandiscs when they're on a cart…?)   But that's not all for IFI's women-targetted offerings. Check out Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei, coming to Switch on the 28th of June. Aksys isn't going to let IFI monopolize all of the otome announcements though! Here's Jack Jeanne, a Switch visual novel where heroine Kisa is admitted to a prestigious drama school… that happens to be all-male! Looks like some amusing gender hijinks will be in store.   There's a fair bit more to the presentation, which I recommend watching in full, but I think that covers the highlights. Man, I am going to be SO BUSY playing stuff in June… ASSORTED NEWSBITS   MOON. -Re:make- has been announced for Switch. No, this isn't moon, the Yoshio Kimura-helmed RPG deconstruction… though, like that game, MOON. -Re:make- does have a place in gaming history: it was made by many of the staff who would go on to form storied visual novel maker Key. No word on if any staff are returning besides artist Itaru Hinoue, though.  Shueisha, the massive Japanese publishing house best known among anime fans for being the overlords of all things Shonen Jump, are starting up a games publishing division called… Shueisha Games. Their announced games so far are mostly indie titles through their Shueisha Creators CAMP initiative, but they're promising bigger things down the line, including a “smartphone game by a prominent studio” with art by a Shonen Jump artist, along a new title co-published with a “major publisher” with a “major game studio” developing. Very intriguing…  There's another Valis collection releasing. The Valis: Fantasm Soldier Collection 2 includes PC Engine Valis IV, the original Valis for Megadrive, and weird spinoff game Syd of Valis, also originally on the Megadrive. Still no sign of the PC-88 originals, though… Look, I am so goddamned tired of talking about Activision-Blizzard, if you want to read about one (of many) lawsuits they've settled for a frankly insulting amount you can click here   That's another week for the books, then. Since it's April Fools’ Day, I invite you all to post your favorite company gags in the forums. Or, if you hate Aprils 1st with a burning passion, you can still discuss everything going on this week, like the death of E3, the delay of Zelda, and all those fresh announcements. As always, the link to join in is just below. Take it easy and enjoy the weekend, and try not to be too disappointed when that awesome announcement you saw online turns out to be complete BS, OK?

News Amnesia: Memories, Amnesia: Later×Crowd Games' Switch Versions Head West   posted on 2022-04-01 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Idea Factory International's release of Birushana also slated for June 28    Idea Factory International announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

News Amnesia: Memories, Amnesia: Later×Crowd Games' Switch Versions Head West   posted on 2022-04-01 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Idea Factory International's release of Birushana also slated for June 28    Idea Factory International announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

News Amnesia: Memories, Amnesia: Later×Crowd Games' Switch Versions Head West   posted on 2022-04-01 00:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Idea Factory International's release of Birushana also slated for June 28    Idea Factory International announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

Plus Expo event on Thursday that it will release the Amnesia: Memories and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels physically and digitally on Nintendo Switch this fall. It also announced that its release of the Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei visual novel will ship on June 28.    Idea Factory International also announced that it will release Taiwanese developer Wanin International's Dusk Divers 2 game on the Switch, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this summer.      The Switch version of the Amnesia and Amnesia: Later x Crowd visual novels by Idea Factory's Otomate brand shipped in Japan in September and October 2019, respectively.    Idea Factory originally released the Amnesia PlayStation Portable game in Japan in 2011, and released a fandisc titled Amnesia Later for the PSP in 2012. The game has since spawned a sequel titled Amnesia Crowd, which Idea Factory released for the PSP in April 2013. Idea Factory later ported the original game to the PS Vita under the title Amnesia V Edition in December 2013. Additionally the company released the Amnesia World game for the PS Vita in May 2014.    Idea Factory International released the Amnesia: Memories (Amnesia V Edition) game in English on PS Vita, PC, iOS, and Android in August 2015.    Idea Factory later combined the Amnesia Later and Amnesia Crowd games into a single release for the PS Vita in October 2014, titled Amnesia Later x Crowd V Edition.    The game series inspired a 12-episode television anime series that premiered in January 2013. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on Blu-ray and DVD.    The original game's story begins on the morning of August 1, when the protagonist wakes up and discovers she has absolutely no memories of the past. A boy appears before her, and he introduces himself as a ""spirit"" named Orion. The protagonist struggles to regain her memories under the guidance of Orion. She then gets a phone call, but she does not recognize the name on her mobile phone screen. She meets her apparent ""boyfriend,"" despite not knowing his face.      Otomate's Birushana: Rising Flower of Genpei (Birushana Senki: Genpei Hika Musо̄) game launched for the Switch in Japan in September 2020.    Idea Factory International describes the game:   Fifteen years after the Heiji Rebellion, the Heike clan has reached the height of its power, while the Genji clan remains devastated by defeat. Hidden deep within the mountains of Kurama lives Shanao, the youngest surviving male heir to the Genji name. However, Shanao harbors a deep secret known by very few.   The youngest heir to the Genji name is no man.    Torn between her duty to live up to the Genji family name and her desire to live a peaceful life, Shanao sets off in hopes to take down the Heike stronghold and finally bring peace in the country. Her adventure leads her to find new cherished relationships, as well as something deeper than the feud between the rivaling clans.   There are five potential routes for the main character Shanao. Shanao has three abilities: Strength, Knowledge, and Kindness. The Ai-Catch system allows players to see how their choices affect a character's affection level and Shanao's abilities.

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Monthly Anime at Japan Society: In-Person Showcase of Classic, Underseen, and Contemporary Anime   Apr  2nd 2022          Ghost in the Shell- April 15 with pre-screening party The Animatrix- May 27 in 35mm The Night is Short Walk On, Girl- June 17 Princess Mononoke- July 22 in 35mm, 25th anniversary presentation  New York, NY (Mar. 31, 2022) Japan Society is pleased to announce the launch of Monthly Anime on April 15, 2022, which will kick-off with a screening of Mamoru Oshii's seminal cyberpunk classic, Ghost in the Shell. Offering an eclectic range of classic, underseen, and contemporary visions from Japanese animation, Monthly Anime explores the widely influential legacy of anime. Tracing the lineage of anime from modern-day digital animation back to the days of hand-drawn cel animation, this program aims to uncover the multifaceted and remarkable variety of stylistic, technological, and generic possibilities that have kept the medium at the forefront of popularity not just in Japan, but worldwide.   Following Ghost in the Shell in April, the rarely-screened Matrix anthology film The Animatrix—featuring works by Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe, Vampire Hunter D's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and Akira animator Koji Morimoto—screens in 35mm on May 27, 2022. Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl, a JAPAN CUTS 2018 selection and Tomihiko Morimi adaptation, screens on June 17, 2022. Finally, to commemorate 25 years since its 1997 release, Hayao Miyazaki's mystical epic Princess Mononoke screens in 35mm on July 22, 2022.  Tickets: $15/$12 students and seniors /$5 Japan Society members.  Lineup and other details are subject to change. For complete information visit japansociety.org.   SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary. The arrival of a diseased boar spirit, enraged and corrupted by an iron slug, leaves young warrior Ashitaka infected by its demon curse. With his days numbered, Ashitaka journeys westward to seek a cure for his affliction, tracing the boar's path to the sacred forest of the Deer God, a forbidden realm belonging to an ancient forest spirit. Upon his arrival, Ashitaka stumbles into an elemental conflict between the forest's protector San, a fearless warrior princess raised by wolves, and a neighboring iron town that has ravaged the earth. Released to universal acclaim, Hayao Miyazaki's 14th-century tale is one of the director's grandest achievements, a sweeping epic with breathtaking visuals and profound thematic ambitions that has captivated audiences ever since its release.     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Press Release homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

SCREENING SCHEDULE  Ghost in the Shell  Friday, April 15, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Mamoru Oshii, 1995, 83 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English Subtitles. With Atsuko Tanaka, Akio Otsuka, Iemasa Kayumi.  Preceded by a 6PM pre-screening party with Japanese foods and snacks provided by Kikkoman and Sapporo U.S.A. Mamoru Oshii's groundbreaking cyberpunk classic conjures a startling vision of the future—a new age of global interconnectedness wherein neural pathways and information networks have become inextricably linked. Surveilling the sprawling technopolis of New Port City, Major Motoko Kusanagi, a cyborg officer specializing in cybercrime, hunts down a mysterious entity responsible for a series of ‘ghost-hackings’ that have infiltrated human hosts. Known only as the Puppet Master, the newly-surfaced threat leads Major to uncover a vast conspiracy—prompting her to question her own humanity and purpose of existence.  The Animatrix  Friday, May 27, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Peter Chung, Andy Jones, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Takeshi Koike, Mahiro Maeda, Koji Morimoto, Shinichiro Watanabe; 2003, 102 min., 35mm, color, in English. With Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Clayton Watson.  A straight-to-DVD classic, the anime companion to The Matrix series received a limited number of theatrical screenings in 2003 as part of a promotional push for Reloaded. Rarely screened since, this dazzling and visually inventive tie-in laid the groundwork for franchise anthology spinoffs with its nine imaginative stories—directed by some of anime's greatest luminaries including Ninja Scroll's Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Cowboy Bebop's Shinichiro Watanabe and Æon Flux's Peter Chung. Expanding upon the series' universe, this frenetic and imaginative addition to the Matrix franchise is anything but a lazy cash-grab and ranks as one of best Matrix films.  The Night is Short Walk On, Girl  Friday, June 17, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Masaaki Yuasa, 2017, 93 min., DCP, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Gen Hoshino, Kana Hanazawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryuji Akiyama.  Spunky college student Otome embarks on a booze-soaked romp through Kyoto in search of a book from her childhood. As the night stretches on for what seems like years, her quest takes on epic, hallucinatory proportions—starring a fanged god of used books, a guerilla theater troupe, a committee of crab-dancing philosophers, and love-inducing carp that fall from the sky. Meanwhile, an upperclassman at her university (voiced by pop star Gen Hoshino) undergoes a series of equally improbable misadventures in his attempts to win her heart. Adapted from the award-winning novel by Tomihiko Morimi, acclaimed animation director Masaaki Yuasa's The Night is Short Walk On, Girl is a delightful trip down the rabbit hole into questions of fate and interconnectedness, rendered in an astounding visual style.  Princess Mononoke  Friday, July 22, 2022 at 7:00 PM  Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997, 134 min., 35mm, color, in Japanese with English subtitles. With Yoji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka.  25th Anniversary.

I hope they fundraise through phantom badge sales or do a limited online event. The AC Convention Center is not solid on accessibility, and the idea that an event *may not*enforce their own policies goes against all sense and sensibility.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

I'd been going to AnimeNEXT for years, I first went to AnimeNEXT when at it's previous location in Sommerset but stopped because it was far from where I was living at the time and the con wasn't well organized, but once I went to college in Philly it was a no brainer.

I hope they fundraise through phantom badge sales or do a limited online event. The AC Convention Center is not solid on accessibility, and the idea that an event *may not*enforce their own policies goes against all sense and sensibility.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

I'd been going to AnimeNEXT for years, I first went to AnimeNEXT when at it's previous location in Sommerset but stopped because it was far from where I was living at the time and the con wasn't well organized, but once I went to college in Philly it was a no brainer.

I hope they fundraise through phantom badge sales or do a limited online event. The AC Convention Center is not solid on accessibility, and the idea that an event *may not*enforce their own policies goes against all sense and sensibility.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

It's less. I am assuming the page originally had more information than they were either allowed to disclose or that the site would rather not have them disclose. It might be a little of both since lawyers are involved.

I hope they fundraise through phantom badge sales or do a limited online event. The AC Convention Center is not solid on accessibility, and the idea that an event *may not*enforce their own policies goes against all sense and sensibility.

They get a price hike because they weren't there for two years?  Gee, I wonder why they wouldn't have held a convention there those years?  No cooperation on safety measures.  And another event happening nearby is just a pain.  I've been to conventions where another big event was in town for part of it, and it sucked, aside from the food trucks that showed up for the day of overlap.     It sounds like they ended up with not a lot of cooperation in exchange for those contractual obligations, so using it for staff time was the way to go.

It's less. I am assuming the page originally had more information than they were either allowed to disclose or that the site would rather not have them disclose. It might be a little of both since lawyers are involved.

Really sucks that this is an issue and they're having issues with them.   Somerset will always be my favorite venue of theirs, AC venue much less so due to many reasons. But hopefully they can find an awesome home for next year and onwards!

I'd been going to AnimeNEXT for years, I first went to AnimeNEXT when at it's previous location in Sommerset but stopped because it was far from where I was living at the time and the con wasn't well organized, but once I went to college in Philly it was a no brainer.

Advertorial #SetTheStage with Hisayo Usui   by Sony (Paid Advertisement), Mar 31st 2022          Welcome back to another special #SetTheStage fan feedback feature! #SetTheStage is an ongoing campaign from Sony to bring you closer than ever before to many of the talented and innovative artists among its entertainment brands – including their anime studios. Today, we'll be visiting CloverWorks, an animation studio under the umbrella of Sony's globally renowned ANIPLEX brand.    CloverWorks was established in 2018 as an offshoot of another beloved ANIPLEX animation studio, A-1 Pictures. Since the split, CloverWorks has come into their own, forming a unique identity and creating some of the most daring, critically acclaimed anime series of recent years. Among their catalog of hits are TV series and films like WONDER EGG PRIORITY, DARLING in the FRANXX,  PERSONA5 the Animation, and Her Blue Sky. Most recently, you've seen CloverWorks' talents on display in the global smash-hit My Dress-Up Darling, and very soon you'll be watching their hotly anticipated adaptation of the bestselling Shonen Jump comedy manga  SPY×FAMILY.    There's no doubt that CloverWorks ranks among the best anime studios out there – and their quick rise to the top is amazing for a group that's only a little over three years old! But CloverWorks wouldn't be producing such phenomenal projects without the talents of some amazing creators. So, let's #SetTheStage for one such creator at CloverWorks: Hisayo Usui.      Hisayo Usui is an art director at CloverWorks. Her body of work includes background work and art direction on many of the studio's biggest and best-loved productions, including Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, Fate/Grand Order -Final Singularity Grand Temple of Time: Solomon-, and Horimiya. Her design work will take center stage on  SPY×FAMILY, in co-production with WIT STUDIO, debuting on Crunchyroll this April.    In this interview, Usui reads feedback from fans and viewers like you… and she's got plenty to say about her work. Among the topics she discusses are how anime art production differs from painting and illustration, the structure of CloverWorks' renowned art department, taking inspiration from real-life locations, getting compliments on social media, subtle things that affect the look and feel of scenes, and much more.    One particularly interesting look behind-the-scenes is Usui's detailed breakdown of the art production process, starting from reading the screenplay to creating conceptual “art boards,” then moving onto to fine-tuning layouts before finally creating the impressive, full-color backdrops that bring your favorite anime scenes to life. Keep watching it all and you'll hear her inspiring words for others looking to pursue similar careers.    We hope you've enjoyed this latest #SetTheStage peek behind the curtain of anime production. Hisayo Usui is helping lead a generation of talented animation creators at CloverWorks – and there are even more creative, diverse, and inspirational talents helping to craft Sony's universe of entertainment. Be sure to check out the #SetTheStage hashtag on social media for more exclusive content featuring Sony's world-class talents in animation and more!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Advertorial homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Advertorial #SetTheStage with Hisayo Usui   by Sony (Paid Advertisement), Mar 31st 2022          Welcome back to another special #SetTheStage fan feedback feature! #SetTheStage is an ongoing campaign from Sony to bring you closer than ever before to many of the talented and innovative artists among its entertainment brands – including their anime studios. Today, we'll be visiting CloverWorks, an animation studio under the umbrella of Sony's globally renowned ANIPLEX brand.    CloverWorks was established in 2018 as an offshoot of another beloved ANIPLEX animation studio, A-1 Pictures. Since the split, CloverWorks has come into their own, forming a unique identity and creating some of the most daring, critically acclaimed anime series of recent years. Among their catalog of hits are TV series and films like WONDER EGG PRIORITY, DARLING in the FRANXX,  PERSONA5 the Animation, and Her Blue Sky. Most recently, you've seen CloverWorks' talents on display in the global smash-hit My Dress-Up Darling, and very soon you'll be watching their hotly anticipated adaptation of the bestselling Shonen Jump comedy manga  SPY×FAMILY.    There's no doubt that CloverWorks ranks among the best anime studios out there – and their quick rise to the top is amazing for a group that's only a little over three years old! But CloverWorks wouldn't be producing such phenomenal projects without the talents of some amazing creators. So, let's #SetTheStage for one such creator at CloverWorks: Hisayo Usui.      Hisayo Usui is an art director at CloverWorks. Her body of work includes background work and art direction on many of the studio's biggest and best-loved productions, including Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, Fate/Grand Order -Final Singularity Grand Temple of Time: Solomon-, and Horimiya. Her design work will take center stage on  SPY×FAMILY, in co-production with WIT STUDIO, debuting on Crunchyroll this April.    In this interview, Usui reads feedback from fans and viewers like you… and she's got plenty to say about her work. Among the topics she discusses are how anime art production differs from painting and illustration, the structure of CloverWorks' renowned art department, taking inspiration from real-life locations, getting compliments on social media, subtle things that affect the look and feel of scenes, and much more.    One particularly interesting look behind-the-scenes is Usui's detailed breakdown of the art production process, starting from reading the screenplay to creating conceptual “art boards,” then moving onto to fine-tuning layouts before finally creating the impressive, full-color backdrops that bring your favorite anime scenes to life. Keep watching it all and you'll hear her inspiring words for others looking to pursue similar careers.    We hope you've enjoyed this latest #SetTheStage peek behind the curtain of anime production. Hisayo Usui is helping lead a generation of talented animation creators at CloverWorks – and there are even more creative, diverse, and inspirational talents helping to craft Sony's universe of entertainment. Be sure to check out the #SetTheStage hashtag on social media for more exclusive content featuring Sony's world-class talents in animation and more!     discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:               Advertorial homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Advertorial #SetTheStage with Hisayo Usui   by Sony (Paid Advertisement), Mar 31st 2022          Welcome back to another special #SetTheStage fan feedback feature! #SetTheStage is an ongoing campaign from Sony to bring you closer than ever before to many of the talented and innovative artists among its entertainment brands – including their anime studios. Today, we'll be visiting CloverWorks, an animation studio under the umbrella of Sony's globally renowned ANIPLEX brand.    CloverWorks was established in 2018 as an offshoot of another beloved ANIPLEX animation studio, A-1 Pictures. Since the split, CloverWorks has come into their own, forming a unique identity and creating some of the most daring, critically acclaimed anime series of recent years. Among their catalog of hits are TV series and films like WONDER EGG PRIORITY, DARLING in the FRANXX,  PERSONA5 the Animation, and Her Blue Sky. Most recently, you've seen CloverWorks' talents on display in the global smash-hit My Dress-Up Darling, and very soon you'll be watching their hotly anticipated adaptation of the bestselling Shonen Jump comedy manga  SPY×FAMILY.    There's no doubt that CloverWorks ranks among the best anime studios out there – and their quick rise to the top is amazing for a group that's only a little over three years old! But CloverWorks wouldn't be producing such phenomenal projects without the talents of some amazing creators. So, let's #SetTheStage for one such creator at CloverWorks: Hisayo Usui.      Hisayo Usui is an art director at CloverWorks. Her body of work includes background work and art direction on many of the studio's biggest and best-loved productions, including Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, Fate/Grand Order -Final Singularity Grand Temple of Time: Solomon-, and Horimiya. Her design work will take center stage on  SPY×FAMILY, in co-production with WIT STUDIO, debuting on Crunchyroll this April.    In this interview, Usui reads feedback from fans and viewers like you… and she's got plenty to say about her work. Among the topics she discusses are how anime art production differs from painting and illustration, the structure of CloverWorks' renowned art department, taking inspiration from real-life locations, getting compliments on social media, subtle things that affect the look and feel of scenes, and much more.    One particularly interesting look behind-the-scenes is Usui's detailed breakdown of the art production process, starting from reading the screenplay to creating conceptual “art boards,” then moving onto to fine-tuning layouts before finally creating the impressive, full-color backdrops that bring your favorite anime scenes to life. Keep watching it all and you'll hear her inspiring words for others looking to pursue similar careers.    We hope you've enjoyed this latest #SetTheStage peek behind the curtain of anime production. Hisayo Usui is helping lead a generation of talented animation creators at CloverWorks – and there are even more creative, diverse, and inspirational talents helping to craft Sony's universe of entertainment.

Advertorial #SetTheStage with Hisayo Usui   by Sony (Paid Advertisement), Mar 31st 2022          Welcome back to another special #SetTheStage fan feedback feature! #SetTheStage is an ongoing campaign from Sony to bring you closer than ever before to many of the talented and innovative artists among its entertainment brands – including their anime studios. Today, we'll be visiting CloverWorks, an animation studio under the umbrella of Sony's globally renowned ANIPLEX brand.    CloverWorks was established in 2018 as an offshoot of another beloved ANIPLEX animation studio, A-1 Pictures. Since the split, CloverWorks has come into their own, forming a unique identity and creating some of the most daring, critically acclaimed anime series of recent years. Among their catalog of hits are TV series and films like WONDER EGG PRIORITY, DARLING in the FRANXX,  PERSONA5 the Animation, and Her Blue Sky. Most recently, you've seen CloverWorks' talents on display in the global smash-hit My Dress-Up Darling, and very soon you'll be watching their hotly anticipated adaptation of the bestselling Shonen Jump comedy manga  SPY×FAMILY.    There's no doubt that CloverWorks ranks among the best anime studios out there – and their quick rise to the top is amazing for a group that's only a little over three years old! But CloverWorks wouldn't be producing such phenomenal projects without the talents of some amazing creators. So, let's #SetTheStage for one such creator at CloverWorks: Hisayo Usui.      Hisayo Usui is an art director at CloverWorks. Her body of work includes background work and art direction on many of the studio's biggest and best-loved productions, including Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, Fate/Grand Order -Final Singularity Grand Temple of Time: Solomon-, and Horimiya. Her design work will take center stage on  SPY×FAMILY, in co-production with WIT STUDIO, debuting on Crunchyroll this April.    In this interview, Usui reads feedback from fans and viewers like you… and she's got plenty to say about her work. Among the topics she discusses are how anime art production differs from painting and illustration, the structure of CloverWorks' renowned art department, taking inspiration from real-life locations, getting compliments on social media, subtle things that affect the look and feel of scenes, and much more.    One particularly interesting look behind-the-scenes is Usui's detailed breakdown of the art production process, starting from reading the screenplay to creating conceptual “art boards,” then moving onto to fine-tuning layouts before finally creating the impressive, full-color backdrops that bring your favorite anime scenes to life. Keep watching it all and you'll hear her inspiring words for others looking to pursue similar careers.    We hope you've enjoyed this latest #SetTheStage peek behind the curtain of anime production. Hisayo Usui is helping lead a generation of talented animation creators at CloverWorks – and there are even more creative, diverse, and inspirational talents helping to craft Sony's universe of entertainment.

News Viz Media to Publish Mieri Hiranishi's The Girl That Can't Get a Girlfriend Manga   posted on 2022-04-02 14:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Viz to publish manga under its ""Viz Originals"" label    Manga creator Mieri Hiranishi announced on Friday that Viz Media will publish the English version of her The Girl That Can't Get a Girlfriend (Kanojo ga Denai Onna) manga.    Hiranishi posted a video to explain the news (viewers can toggle on the English subtitles for the below video):      Hiranishi explained in the video that she was planning to self-publish the net manga, but publishers approached her instead to publish the work.    Viz Media will publish the manga in English under its ""Viz Originals"" label.    The manga is currently available for free in English to read on such services as Webtoons and Tapas, and in Japanese on pixiv.    Hiranishi originally wrote the semi-autobiographical manga in college, and then more recently redrew the series and posted it online.

News Viz Media to Publish Mieri Hiranishi's The Girl That Can't Get a Girlfriend Manga   posted on 2022-04-02 14:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Viz to publish manga under its ""Viz Originals"" label    Manga creator Mieri Hiranishi announced on Friday that Viz Media will publish the English version of her The Girl That Can't Get a Girlfriend (Kanojo ga Denai Onna) manga.    Hiranishi posted a video to explain the news (viewers can toggle on the English subtitles for the below video):      Hiranishi explained in the video that she was planning to self-publish the net manga, but publishers approached her instead to publish the work.    Viz Media will publish the manga in English under its ""Viz Originals"" label.    The manga is currently available for free in English to read on such services as Webtoons and Tapas, and in Japanese on pixiv.    Hiranishi originally wrote the semi-autobiographical manga in college, and then more recently redrew the series and posted it online.

REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        earl.m            Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 3:08 pm            I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

Whether you are a man or a woman, both have to get their intended love interest, interested in them.  Chasing after your intended choice, the ultimate goal, for everyone living, is to get them to have eyes only for you.   He isn't being drugged and he is not imprisoned.  He has his agency.  In today's cultural minefields I can see why some might not like her actions, but I am not one of them.

Takagi's 'teasing' is the most harmless and innocent thing. Yes, she's more clever than Nishikata and knows how to deal with him so she always 'wins', but in the end of the day it's just two middle-school kids with a crush playing with each other.

To the point where we even get a segment of no teasing in the UFO story where it's just the two of them hanging out and goofing around like an actual couple.    Also, Nishikata won! Of course, he didn't realize it.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

That's an special episode to celebrate Tagaki going into a more popular magazine, it's quite good since it's designed to tease the reader not Nishikata.

At first I thought ""kind of off-model this week"", then I thought ""This must be some anime Nishikata is watching with role-reversal, I wonder if he's going to try to work the green pepper thing into a revenge plot..."", then I forgot about it as the episode went on.

And that was after we saw her looking at him for all her romantic dialogue, because she was intending it for him.    Just a really beautiful and fun episode.

However, I'm afraid that I thought the schtick had run its course a short way into the ""return to school"" part of the episode.  Time to just own up to what's happening Nishikata.  Maybe he needs to be teased for not having a girlfriend yet in order to readjust his behavior?   Kaguya-sama, Love is war showed that there is life after the confession, after all....

REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        earl.m            Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 3:08 pm            I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

Whether you are a man or a woman, both have to get their intended love interest, interested in them.  Chasing after your intended choice, the ultimate goal, for everyone living, is to get them to have eyes only for you.   He isn't being drugged and he is not imprisoned.  He has his agency.  In today's cultural minefields I can see why some might not like her actions, but I am not one of them.

Takagi's 'teasing' is the most harmless and innocent thing. Yes, she's more clever than Nishikata and knows how to deal with him so she always 'wins', but in the end of the day it's just two middle-school kids with a crush playing with each other.

To the point where we even get a segment of no teasing in the UFO story where it's just the two of them hanging out and goofing around like an actual couple.    Also, Nishikata won! Of course, he didn't realize it.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

That's an special episode to celebrate Tagaki going into a more popular magazine, it's quite good since it's designed to tease the reader not Nishikata.

At first I thought ""kind of off-model this week"", then I thought ""This must be some anime Nishikata is watching with role-reversal, I wonder if he's going to try to work the green pepper thing into a revenge plot..."", then I forgot about it as the episode went on.

And that was after we saw her looking at him for all her romantic dialogue, because she was intending it for him.    Just a really beautiful and fun episode.

However, I'm afraid that I thought the schtick had run its course a short way into the ""return to school"" part of the episode.  Time to just own up to what's happening Nishikata.  Maybe he needs to be teased for not having a girlfriend yet in order to readjust his behavior?   Kaguya-sama, Love is war showed that there is life after the confession, after all....

REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        earl.m            Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 3:08 pm            I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

Whether you are a man or a woman, both have to get their intended love interest, interested in them.  Chasing after your intended choice, the ultimate goal, for everyone living, is to get them to have eyes only for you.   He isn't being drugged and he is not imprisoned.  He has his agency.

Takagi's 'teasing' is the most harmless and innocent thing. Yes, she's more clever than Nishikata and knows how to deal with him so she always 'wins', but in the end of the day it's just two middle-school kids with a crush playing with each other.

To the point where we even get a segment of no teasing in the UFO story where it's just the two of them hanging out and goofing around like an actual couple.    Also, Nishikata won! Of course, he didn't realize it.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

That's an special episode to celebrate Tagaki going into a more popular magazine, it's quite good since it's designed to tease the reader not Nishikata.

At first I thought ""kind of off-model this week"", then I thought ""This must be some anime Nishikata is watching with role-reversal, I wonder if he's going to try to work the green pepper thing into a revenge plot..."", then I forgot about it as the episode went on.

REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        earl.m            Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 3:08 pm            I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

Whether you are a man or a woman, both have to get their intended love interest, interested in them.  Chasing after your intended choice, the ultimate goal, for everyone living, is to get them to have eyes only for you.   He isn't being drugged and he is not imprisoned.  He has his agency.

To the point where we even get a segment of no teasing in the UFO story where it's just the two of them hanging out and goofing around like an actual couple.    Also, Nishikata won! Of course, he didn't realize it.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

That's an special episode to celebrate Tagaki going into a more popular magazine, it's quite good since it's designed to tease the reader not Nishikata.

In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

Whether you are a man or a woman, both have to get their intended love interest, interested in them.  Chasing after your intended choice, the ultimate goal, for everyone living, is to get them to have eyes only for you.   He isn't being drugged and he is not imprisoned.  He has his agency.

Takagi's 'teasing' is the most harmless and innocent thing. Yes, she's more clever than Nishikata and knows how to deal with him so she always 'wins', but in the end of the day it's just two middle-school kids with a crush playing with each other.

To the point where we even get a segment of no teasing in the UFO story where it's just the two of them hanging out and goofing around like an actual couple.    Also, Nishikata won! Of course, he didn't realize it.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

That's an special episode to celebrate Tagaki going into a more popular magazine, it's quite good since it's designed to tease the reader not Nishikata.

Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

Takagi's 'teasing' is the most harmless and innocent thing. Yes, she's more clever than Nishikata and knows how to deal with him so she always 'wins', but in the end of the day it's just two middle-school kids with a crush playing with each other.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3            Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        earl.m            Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 3:08 pm            I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal.

I love how Takagi's mask is dropping more and more. Like, she wanted Nishikata to be her prince only for his performance to actually take her breath away. And then look at her reaction when she has to hug Nishikata to prevent him from falling and realizes what she'd done.

REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 [1/2] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA,"         Goto page 1, 2  Next Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        earl.m            Posted: Mon Jan 24, 2022 3:08 pm            I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.

And that was after we saw her looking at him for all her romantic dialogue, because she was intending it for him.    Just a really beautiful and fun episode.

02-04-2022,anime,1,0,,EP. REVIEW: Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 [1/2] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," I have a more negative view of Takagi's actions than most people. In addition to gaslighting Nishikata, teasing him with her body, prodding him on his insecurities, invading his privacy (i.e. concerning hobbies and activities of his that he wants to keep secret) and other things that could easily be perceived as harassment and manipulation were the writing, directing, animation etc. willing to depict it as such instead of framing it as harmless and cute, we can't ignore that Takagi fully knows what she is doing. She is romantically interested in Nishikata, and her antics are part of her long-game play to get him to reciprocate. Takagi exploits the immature male's social tendencies - i.e. competitiveness, honor/shame etc. - in order to get him thinking about her all the time, become fascinated with her, want to spend more time with her etc. It significantly increases the amount of attention that Nishikata - who left to his own devices would have little interest in girls beyond casual acquaintance/friendship level, let alone romance (he doesn't even participate in the venerable male anime character traditions of owning swimsuit magazines or trying to catch a glance at the girls at the swimming pool) - pays to her. Most important: it keeps Nishikata's focus trained solely on her rather than potentially on other girls. spoiler[This is significant because manga readers know that Takagi's actions had their intended effect: down the line Nishikata marries her without having so much as ever dated anybody else.]   I should point out: it isn't that I care about any of the issues that I am raising. After all, I love this show. But I also like the other ""imitators"" whose female protagonists get criticized for doing the same thing that Takagi does, with Don't Bully Me Miss Nagatoro and Uzaki Chan Wants to Hang Out among them. In a way, the other oft-criticized imitators are worse. In contrast with Takagi, Uzaki rarely ever actually intends to harass Shinichi and certainly isn't trying to dominate his attention. Instead it happens mostly by accident as a result of Uzaki - not the sharpest tack in the drawer - acting on impulse without thinking. Nagatoro and her crew only started bullying the nameless MC because they saw him judgmentally eye them, try to avoid them and then he dropped his comic drawings, which revealed that - as they had already guessed by the way that he was looking at and trying to avoid them - he possessed retrograde opinions of women. Not saying that misogynists deserve to be teased, but merely pointing out that Nishikata is a decent fellow who in no way deserves his treatment. The opposite is true - Takagi teases Nishikata BECAUSE he is a decent fellow as it is why she likes him. The problem: her teasing him is conditioning him to like her back.    One is probably thinking: big deal, Nishikata gets attention from a cute girl - and down the line a girlfriend (no reason to treat it as a spoiler ... a shonen gag comedy about middle schoolers isn't doing 3 seasons and a movie just pull Five Centimeters Per Second on us) - out of the deal. But shouldn't Takagi get to have agency in his romantic choices instead of being deprived of it by Takagi's premeditated machinations? Nishikata's lacking Nagatoro's hard edge - and Uzaki's figure - shouldn't exempt her behavior from scrutiny.  ",positive,en,{}

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,{}
02-04-2022,anime,6,0,,Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022 - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022   by The Anime News Network Editorial Team, Mar 31st 2022             Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well.

It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives     ",positive,en,{}
02-04-2022,anime,6,0,,Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022 - Anime News Network:SEA,"           Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!

The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!     discuss this in the forum (34 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives   ",positive,en,{}
02-04-2022,anime,6,0,,Our Most Anticipated Anime Of Spring 2022 - Anime News Network:SEA,"       Welcome to our Most Anticipated Anime feature for the Spring 2022 season. Below you'll find our editorial team's top (tentative) picks from the 46-odd shows slated to premiere in January. What are your favorite picks? Head on over to our poll and pick your top five. We'll publish the results before preview guide launches on April 1. Also, if you're still having a hard time choosing what to add to your queue, or you're just down for a good time, do check out Anime News Network's Spring 2022 Trailer Watch Party with YouTube personality Geoff Thew (Mother's Basement)!          Most Anticipated: Love After World Domination  Yeah yeah, I know this is likely interrupting a lengthy sweep of SPY x FAMILY top spots, but I'm more than happy to play the spoiler for this adorable-looking Super Sentai RomCom. There's nothing that I enjoy more than a good romantic comedy anime, and this looks like a total treat. The premise is great, the character designs are wonderful, and based on the trailers the animation looks strong all-around. Like this past season's Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department there's the risk of it playing a little too much inside baseball with the tokusatsu angle, but that's a small hurdle to clear for what looks like an absolutely adorable setup.    Runner-Up: SPY x FAMILY   That being said, yeah, I'm hyped for SPY x FAMILY a whole lot too. I've been reading the manga since it began, loving it just as long, and waiting for its inevitable anime adaptation to bring as many people as possible in for this wonderful, funny, and endlessly charming series. And going by the promos the production is seriously on-point. The secret sauce of this story is how it can effortlessly balance intense action and gut-busting humor without sweating a drop, and the trailers look ridiculously great at both. You probably don't need me to tell you this one's worth watching, but it's good enough that I feel compelled to do it anyway.    Alongside those, I am going to be feasting this season. Kaguya-sama is coming back, and as one of the greatest modern romcoms ever made it stands to reason I'm going to devour it. In fact, there's a whole block of romance-tinged series this season for me to chow down on between Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie, Aharen-san wa Hakarenai, and the potential disasterpiece of A Couple of Cuckoos. While I don't know if it'll actually have any romance, just the fact that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is from the creator of Teasing Master Takagi-san is enough for me to check it out. There's even some fantasy series of different varieties that look appealing like Healer Girl and The Dawn of the Witch. And of course, this spring marks the beginning of back-to-back seasons of Love Live!, which means I've automatically won for the next six months.          Most Anticipated: SPY X FAMILY  I love a good comedy anime, and some of my favorite comedies of all time are those that revolve around character misunderstandings – shows like Gamers!, School Rumble, and Yamada's First Time that are able to push misunderstandings to absurd lengths through unique circumstances for the sake of comedic payoff. So when I heard that SPY x FAMILY was basically that but with a spy, an assassin, and a telepath, you end up getting more than just my curiosity… you get my full, undivided attention. I marathoned the first six volumes of the manga and it is impressive how deftly the author is able to juggle all the unique abilities and over-the-top characters in such a serious setting. After watching some of the previews and being impressed by the above-average presentation for what is extensively a reactionary type of comedy, I look forward to seeing how some of these classic situations where the characters completely misjudge each other end up playing out.    Runner-Up: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic    I will admit that I wasn't the biggest fan of Kaguya Sama: Love Is War at first. While the show definitely seemed to fall into my wheelhouse of comedy anime, I initially found it a bit too cynical for its own good. However, as time went on and the show managed to find its emotional foothold, I began to appreciate both its comedy and character writing a lot more. Season two especially allowed me to better appreciate these characters by giving us a better look at where that rather cynical worldview can sometimes come from. I have read a bit of the manga after season two and there's a good chance that season three will feature even more of those intense character moments. Either way, I think there will definitely be a lot of good material to appreciate and I definitely can't wait for another snazzy anime opening!          Most Anticipated: Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   In 2020's My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!, a young woman is reincarnated as the villainess in a stereotypical girl's dating sim. The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs takes the same general idea and twists it. Instead of a young woman, it's a young man. Instead of becoming the villainess, he is a random background character. Instead of a kind dunce, he's a bit of a self-serving asshole. But that's just the start of things.    As it's based on the setting of a D-grade reverse-harem romance, the fantasy world is full of plot holes, most notably the absurd level of misandry that permeates society. Noblewomen have several lovers beyond their husbands (who are little more than slaves making money for their wives). Second and third sons are married off to elderly women, only to then be sent off to the front lines for an easy life insurance payout. Our hero wants to avoid this fate and is willing to do whatever it takes to do so. His plan is simply to have enough money and power to secure his own independence—too bad he somehow catches the eye of both the heroine and the villainess. It's a hilarious ride where you can both cheer for the hero fighting against this half-baked world and laugh whenever karma smacks him upside the head.    Runner-Up: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie    So many stories end with the main couple getting together. However, this is where Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie begins. Shikimori is cute and popular, athletic and intelligent. But her boyfriend, Izumi, is none of these things; worse still, he is unlucky and accident-prone to a dangerous degree. However, because of this, he is one of the few to see the other side of his girlfriend. Whenever he is in trouble, be that physical or emotional, her cute veneer fades away and she becomes a suave badass that oozes coolness from every pore.    What I love about this change is that it's accompanied by a shift in Shikimori's character design—her chin becomes sharper, as do her eyes. She looks elegant and dangerous, capable of sweeping anyone off their feet. And while there is an obvious swapping of stereotypical gender roles between Shikimori and Izumi in this story, it's important to remember that Shikimori isn't just the cute girl or the badass; she's both. Shikimori and Izumi simply bring out the best in each other across the board, as any good couple should.          Most Anticipated: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie  You can blame My Dress-Up Darling for rekindling my romcom torch just in time for Kaguya-sama season 3 and Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie. Since I like to highlight non-sequels here, however, I'll defer my focus to Shikimori, which comes with the blue-ribbon premise of “what if Utena Tenjou was your girlfriend?” If romcoms live or die by their gimmicks, then I can hardly think of one more ripe for virality than the one about a handsome tomboy coolly kabedon-ing her doe-eyed boy squeeze. Online wasn't quite ready for Witch Craft Works and its perpetually princess-carried male protagonist—a fact towards which I will forever be bitter, because that show rules—but I hope, in 2022, Shikimori can at least find some justice. Plus, the previews are bursting with color, and Doga Kobo know how to put together a good-looking anime. Maybe this will be the year of sakuga-rich romcom supremacy.    Beyond that, I have my eye on Vampire in the Garden. No doubt this looks and sounds pretty generic at first blush, but its staff has a good pedigree, and more importantly, I like vampires. Vanitas is nearly over, and Call of the Night doesn't air until the summer, so perhaps Studio Wit can slake my spring bloodthirst. Bubble, also on Wit's docket, will be premiering this season, and I will be heartbroken if the chaotic dream team alignment of Gen Urobuchi, Tetsuro Araki, and Takeshi Obata somehow manages to be boring. I couldn't care less about it being good or not, but it had better be loud. Finally, the only thing I know about SPY x FAMILY is that there's a funny-faced little gremlin girl, and that's good enough for me.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  Some ongoing shows can struggle with diminishing returns as they accumulate more seasons, but Kaguya-sama: Love is War seems just a bit more ambitious than that. It's still probably the funniest, most laugh-out-loud anime comedy of the modern era, yes, but recall all the other stuff its second season was able to get up to. The series showed an impressive penchant for pulling off dramatic turns too, which is no small feat when you consider how most of these characters are necessarily stupid as hell. That's the trick though, that this series has endeared these doofuses to me. They're idiots, but they're my idiots, and that even includes Ishigami. Plus, I can't not admire the stones on this series to announce its third season by putting out a whole bonus episode, featuring the characters joking about the very notion of third seasons! Now that's confidence, and if you, like me, have been won over by Kaguya-sama this far along, you know it's earned confidence.    Runner-up: Love Live! Nijigasaki High School Idol Club 2nd Season   There are actually a fair amount of returning faces in this forthcoming Spring season, some more surprising than others. A new Black Rock Shooter? A new Ikki Tousen?! What year is it?! But the other follow-up I'm really looking forward to is the return of those girls in the Nijigasaki High School Idol Club, coming back for another go at what was one of Love Live!'s more atypical iterations. I'm specifically hopeful for this second round since, after the first season necessarily loaded itself up with specific character-focus episodes, having all those now covered means the opportunity for some more complex or ambitious plot-lines featuring all these girls. Of course, I already know that several new members are going to be added to the club this season as well, but given that I'm not a devotee of the mobile game they spawned from, I'm looking forward to getting to know them on my own time. And seeing how they get wrangled into things by the unstoppable swag of that sentient can of Monster Energy known as Yu Takasaki.          Most Anticipated: SPY x FAMILY  This was a no brainer – one of my current favorite manga titles getting an adaptation? Yes, please! Not that that's really any different from my usual criteria for whether I'm anticipating a show or not, but it really felt even easier this time around. That's because the Cold War-set spy spoof is the kind of story that I could see making excellent use of the additional elements anime can provide – music and movement could really work to enhance the way the humor works in the story of the Forger family's semi-secret missions, and giving Anya specifically a voice could help to make her an even more delightful character. Since she's arguably the beating heart of the series, that's especially important. Anya's the only person who knows what's actually going on with pretty much everyone else, because the little dear's a psychic…which no one else has the least clue about. So her adoptive father Loid has no idea that she knows that he's really the master spy Twilight and her adoptive mother Yor is in the dark about the fact that Anya knows she's actually an elite assassin. Mostly poor Anya uses her power to ensure that she gets to keep her happy family without getting sent back to the orphanage, but while this does add an element of pathos, it never overwhelms the zanier aspects of the story. SPY x FAMILY in manga form is a near-perfect blend of goofy spy parody and heartfelt family tale with one of my favorite dog characters (Bond could easily be this season's best boy), and unlike with other manga-to-anime transitions, I have very few worries that this one won't make the leap to anime very well.    And while I'm hoping that those aren't going to be famous last words, I'm also harboring hopes for two other favorite manga titles to make a successful transition: Love After World Domination, which should appeal to fans of Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, and Ya Boy Kongming!, and not just because it brings my poetry-was-the-rap-battle-of-the-ancient-world teaching method to life. (But okay, mostly because of that.) But my true second pick for most anticipated show this spring is Dance Dance Danseur, surprising precisely no one. While it isn't likely to be Swan or Princess Tutu, the angle of a male dancer in classical ballet isn't one we see all that often, and done well, there's a lot of room for an exploration of the stigma boys face for taking up ballet and the beauty (and pain) of the art form. If the animation lives up to it, this could be a treat.          Most Anticipated: Kaguya-sama: Love is War Ultra Romantic  This year so far has been a relatively strong contender for romantic comedy anime. Komi-san, My Dress-Up Darling, Sasaki and Miyano, hell even a show like Fantasy Knockout really surprised me. And this new season seems to be shaping up to continue to the streak with Kanamori's Not Just a Cutie already piquing my interest.    There's a lot of top contenders, but when this anime walks in the room everyone else needs to step aside and let the real champion do the fighting. It's time for the big guns, it's not just love, it's war! Kaguya-sama is back baby and she's ready to throw down!! Season 1 was filled with belly-laughing over-the-top punchlines as we watched the two smartest idiots in the room tip-toe-tango around their mutual bludgeoning feelings for each other. Then season 2 delivered a real wallop while being able include the same hilarious jokes and teasing heart pounders, with some real drama! For a character most people didn't even like at first, no less! I was laughing and sobbing, and it's all thanks to the wonderful animation and direction brought by the team to bring out just the maximum amount of emotion. And I expect nothing less from season 3 after two strong showings. Kaguya-sama is a contender not to be overlooked.    Runner-up: SPY x FAMILY   Not a rom-com but equally strong AND cute, is the much awaited adaption of the Shonen Jump spy thriller and family comedy, SPY x FAMILY. I've been a fan of this manga since the beginning. Keeping up with the Forgers is always a good time with the cool undercover spy Loid, the powerful assassin Yor, and the precious and precocious psychic-powered daughter, Anya. Together they make up one family of misfits tied together by a common goal to keep the two neighboring countries at peace. Or at least the best a six-year-old can handle!    It's a good read, and one of my favorite currently running manga in Jump, with enough material to make a compelling show. I can't wait to see people watch it! The trailer looks smooth and colorful with animation by Studio Wit and CloverWorks. Just look at Anya's face! Isn't she such a cutie?! . She's full of great reactions that I can't wait to see animated. Yor and Loid look equally good as a power couple, you can tell they adapted the designs well. The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!

The action and music also seem promising from what I can see. I'm hoping for everything cool, cute, and comedic to be in full force here. It's a fun time for the whole family with the SPY x FAMILY!
