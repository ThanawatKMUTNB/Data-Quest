Co-author Shaenon Garrity counts down her favorite manga from the column. ―  Shaenon's Ten Favorite 'House' Manga It falls upon my bowed shoulders to announce the news: House of 1,000 Manga is ending. After five years of weekly columns, the time has come to move on. Among other things, we're kind of running out of...                           column          26 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kekkaishi   2015 Jun 18, 22:15 26 comments                 manga    Jason exorcises some demons with the teenage spirit-banishing crew of Kekkaishi, a 35-volume action adventure hit. ―  Kekkaishi Manga years are like dog years; a popular shonen or shojo manga lives for 10 or so years, it has a rich, full life (or not), and after it's gone you remember it fondly.

House of 1000 Manga is due in four hours, and I've read everything in the house.

Best known in the U.S. for Tekkon Kinkreet (also published as Black and White), a sci-f...                    column          20 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Inuyashiki   2015 May 22, 00:00 20 comments                 manga    An old man becomes a cybernetic killing machine courtesy of the author of Gantz.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

I wish Tatsumi, who passed away earlier this year, could have drawn a sequel about the second half of his career, during which he b...                    column          9 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kakukaku Shikajika   2015 Apr 24, 00:00 9 comments                 manga    If you were ever curious what life was like for the woman who created Princess Jellyfish, Jason has the manga for you. ―  Kakukaku Shikajika “I want to go back in time and beat up that moron.” —Akiko Higashimura, and many other artists, talking about their younger self Few artists “live the dream” of becoming a professional when they're still a teenager.

Happily, he chronicled a sizeable chunk of it in his 2009 doorstopper of a manga memoir, A Drifting Life, which should be required reading for all who would dare call...                    column          7 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kazuhiko Shimamoto   2015 Apr 10, 00:21 7 comments                 manga    Jason's series on manga about manga continues with a blood-pumping journey through the work of hotblooded Blazing Transfer Student mangaka Kazuhiko Shimamoto. ―  Kazuhiko Shimamoto “I’m just a fanatical hot-blooded mangaka! I can teach you about plot structure, but I can’t give you relationship advice!” “It’s not enough to burn only in your own world! In the face of a crisis, will your burning heart ...                    column          5 comments       House of 1000 Manga - MBQ   2015 Apr  3, 00:00 5 comments                 manga    Shaenon dives into the world of MBQ, a hyperactive dream of manga stardom from the now-legendary Felipe Smith. ―  Recently, manga scholar Matt Thorn ruffled some otaku feathers with a blog post entitled “Why it bugs me that you call your comics ‘manga’.” Although I admire Thorn above all other manga nerds, and as much as white kids appropriating Japanese culture bug me, too (albeit in a personally cr...                    column          21 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Bakuman.   2015 Mar 26, 23:00 21 comments                 manga    Jason straps in for a series of columns focusing on manga about manga, and naturally, his first stop is writer Tsugumi Ohba and artist Takeshi Obata's Bakuman.

(Okay, okay, All You Need Is Kill was a light novel before it was a manga, but bear with me, I'm riffing.)...                    column          15 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Otomen   2015 Feb 27, 01:00 15 comments                 manga    Jason is tickled pink by Aya Kanno's gleeful, playful comedy about taking on gender stereotypes. ―  Otomen “A business like this is so great.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days.

Pile of Shame FINAL: Chie the Brat The Pile of Shame recedes into the mists of history with one final installment, on Isao Takahata's criminally underseen Chie the Brat.  « »     Pile of Shame        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               column          39 comments       Pile of Shame - Colorful   2014 Nov 12, 01:00 39 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at an understated art house drama anime from a few years ago, and finds a lot to admire. ―  COLORFUL To paraphrase Hideaki Anno, people don't commit suicide because they're depressed, people commit suicide because they can no longer imagine happiness. That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me! Chameleon   2014 Sep 17, 00:00 31 comments                 anime    This little-seen delinquent comedy, an early ADV release, made Justin want to hurt himself. ―  Bite Me! Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work. Others take it...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Nitaboh   2014 Apr 16, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    One of the few anime biographies, Nitaboh is surprisingly formulaic for being a true story. ―  Nitaboh, The Shamisen Master Last year, an old friend of mine asked me to help a non-profit group of radio producers come up with a Kickstarter video for a public radio project called ""Heavenly Sight,"" a multi-part audio documentary and web resource on blind African American blues and jazz musicians. It was...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo)   2014 Apr  2, 00:00 18 comments                 anime    A non-hentai show from hentai producers that somehow nobody remembers, despite getting two dubs. There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English. I lay blame for that mostly in his ...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun   2014 Mar  5, 02:24 23 comments                 anime    Isao Takahata's troubled first feature is easily the best anime of the 1960s. ―  Adventures of Hols, Prince of the Sun It's the iron age, somewhere in Scandinavia, and a young boy warrior named Hols is just coming back home from a fierce battle with a pack of wolves. His father, on his deathbed, bids him to return to the Northern village they fled years ago, when an evil sorcerer named Grunwald devas...                    column          8 comments       Pile of Shame - Ai City   2014 Feb 19, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    A sleeper sci-fi film from Koichi Mashimo that might break your brain, but will definitely dazzle your eyes while doing so. ―  Ai City In the opening scenes of Ai City, we are dropped into the middle of a car chase in what is possibly New York City. In the back seat is a former cop, who was fired and is now a private investigator. He doesn't know why he's there, and neither do we.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody. Luckily by this time, humanity had a pretty decent settlement going on the moon, and once thin...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - After School Tinker Bell   2014 Jan  8, 01:00 23 comments                 anime    This week, an OAV based on a light novel series about a romantic couple that solves mysteries around their school. ―  After School Tinker Bell In the last few years there have been a ton of anime adapted from light novels: those small, pulpy, simply written and easy-to-read populist books that lie somewhere between young adult novels and manga. But light novels have been around for a very long time, ...                    column          12 comments       Pile of Shame - Handsome Girl   2013 Dec 25, 01:00 12 comments                 anime    Justin revisits an old one-shot OAV by the creator of Marmalade Boy... and is a little underwhelmed. ―  Handsome Girl When I was in high school, I loved the show Marmalade Boy. A lot. In fact, I wrote an article about it! A perfectly addictive confectionary of chaste teenaged yearning and romance, and undiluted raw crippling angst, I lost many an evening to the adventures of the lovelorn protagonists...                    column          11 comments       Pile of Shame - The Sensualist   2013 Dec 11, 02:10 11 comments                 anime    This week, a unique erotic historical fiction film that has completely slipped through the cracks. ―  The Sensualist (A.K.A. The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty. It felt like a piece of another person's life, so fo...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - Emblem Take 2   2013 Nov 27, 02:02 16 comments                 anime    This week, a rare yakuza time travel comedy. Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" .... No? Didn't think so. ―  Wanna-Be's Lately there's been a lot of chatter about the girls' wrestling TV series, Wanna Be The Strongest In The World.

Instead, it's just sort of lazy and crappy. ―  Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman One thing you can say about Butt Attack Girl Punisher Gautaman (and its sequel OAV, Butt Attack Punisher Girl Gautaman R), you know pretty much exactly what you're getting: a cut-rate early-90s dirty comedy OAV about a girl that beats dudes down with her butt.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That thought occurred to me again and again while I was watching Colorful, the remarkable feature film produced by Sunrise in 2010,...                    column          16 comments       Pile of Shame - SOS!

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair. In 2007 another one started production, after ani...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - The Enemy's The Pirates!   2014 Aug 20, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin tries to return to an old 90s favorite that has become more famous for its obscure, awful dub. ―  The Enemy's The Pirates! ~The Cat's Banquet~ There's a Japanese tradition of stand-up comedy duos known as ""manzai (漫才)."" Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F. Fujio's famous magical large blue cat character who's the star of over 2500 episodes of TV anime and 35 movies (not including short...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - Guyver: Out of Control   2014 Jun 11, 03:43 18 comments                 anime    A mildly entertaining, but super-dated OAV incarnation of everyone's favorite superhero/grotesque monster/schoolboy. ―  Guyver: Out of Control Guyver: Out of Control was one of the earliest anime VHS releases in the US, and being an alternate retelling of the same story that the same company, US Renditions, would later release in dubbed form, was one of the first titles to confuse the hell out of peo...                    column          45 comments       Pile of Shame - Full Moon O Sagashite   2014 May 28, 00:00 45 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look back at the oddball Magical-Idol-Singer-With-Cancer Show from the early '00s. Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering.

Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A. Sohryuden, Legend of the Four Kings) When a much-loved book or manga series gets a TV anime adaptation, fans of the original work hold their breath. Some adaptations improve on the original work.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!!

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing. Unless you go looking for trouble in Tokyo, it's unlikely that a...                    column          17 comments       Pile of Shame: Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories   2013 Nov 13, 01:13 17 comments                 anime    Trying to watch this OAV like biting into a large wad of wet cotton: it's not offensive or unpleasant, but you want to end the experience as fast as humanly possible. ―  Ai Monogatari: 9 Love Stories If there's anything that anime lacks, it's real, adult love stories. We have enough yearning, angsty teen romance to sink a battleship, but realistic love stories about people whose frontal lobes are fir...                    column          23 comments       Pile of Shame - Wanna-Be's   2013 Oct 30, 00:01 23 comments     Did anyone say ""I want more women's wrestling anime?"" ....

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me.

Perhaps the ONLY yakuza time travel comedy. ―  Emblem Take 2 Yakuza aren't a pleasant topic. Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour.

Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows.

I mean that honestly. There was a time not long ago, even in otaku circles, when the idea of incest was odd and outré enough to elicit giggles from the less mature parts of ourselves, and maybe even an ""oh god.""

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA. If they do remember, it's usually not a fond memory: BVUSA was the first attempt by a major Japanese anime producer to insert themselves into th...                           column          17 comments       Pile of Shame - Dead Heat & 3D Anime   2014 Oct 15, 00:00 17 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at the first (and one of the only) 3D anime ever made, for an obscure videodisc system only sold in Japan. ―  Dead Heat Sometimes the reasons behind an anime getting made are more interesting than the show itself. That's definitely the case with Dead Heat, an obscure 1987 OAV from Sunrise that runs only a half hour. Back in the wild days of the nascent 80s home video market, there...                    column          49 comments       Pile of Shame - Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman   2014 Oct  1, 00:06 49 comments                 anime    Justin revisits what was once considered the finest sentai parody in the land. Does it still hold up? ―  Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman It's always a terrifying thing, going back to old shows you loved when you were younger and revisiting them. Many of them, comedies in particular, tend to age very poorly. They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often. The last one I can think of would be 1997's anime adaptation of Tsui Hark's Chinese Ghost Story, which was charming in appearance but kind of a plodding, pointless affair.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic. Does it hold up? Ehh... ―  MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother We need to declare a new genre of anime, right here and now. There needs to be a separate category for the metric ton of overwrought family fare Japan makes, that aims to be Studio Ghibli in quality, but ends up succumbing to its maudlin sentimentality a...                    column          6 comments       Pile of Shame - Eiji   2014 Jul 22, 22:59 6 comments                 anime    Hisashi Eguchi's boxing manga got a short movie treatment back in 1990, but does it hold up? ―  Eiji Hisashi Eguchi is probably a guy that's better known among Japanese creatives than among American otaku. As an illustrator and manga artist, he's designed characters for such anime as Roujin Z and Spriggan, heavily influenced the look of Satoshi Kon's characters (Perfect Blue's final look was based on...                    column          33 comments       Pile of Shame - Mermaid's Scar   2014 Jul  9, 01:15 33 comments                 anime    Rumiko Takahashi's macabre OAV still holds up, and is still creepy, but the dub is really weird sounding. ―  Mermaid's Scar Mermaid's Scar is one of those early stocked-at-every-Blockbuster-Video-in-the-country hits of the VHS era that almost every fan that came of age in the mid-90s saw at one time or another. Colorful, violent, and hypnotic in its own way, it made a big impression on 13-year-old Ju...                    column          10 comments       Pile of Shame - ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll   2014 Jun 25, 00:00 10 comments                 anime    Justin discovers a once-loved series by the creator of Doraemon, and finds it to be pretty dull. ―  ESPer Mami: Hoshizora no Dancing Doll Even though it's never been particularly popular among anime fans in the West, most people at least have heard of Doraemon, Fujiko F.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering. I usually mean that as a joke: anime usually involves young protagonists, but too often their concerns are superficial: being the best at a game, or a sport, o...                    column          34 comments       Pile of Shame - 3x3 Eyes   2014 May 14, 02:26 34 comments                 anime    Once a mainstay of anime club video rooms, 3x3 Eyes isn't brought up very often today. Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

There's a reason. ―  Dark Warrior (Makyu Senjo) It's pretty rare that an anime gets released in both the US and the UK, and with English dubs no less, and yet hardly anyone even remembers the show exists. Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase. His most famous work, the fighter pilot drama series Area 88, landed in the US with a resounding thud in both of its anime adaptations as well as Viz's repeated attempts to publish the manga in English.

Tokyo Metro Explorers: The Next Anime fans who were around back in 2007 might remember a company briefly appearing on the scene known as Bandai Visual USA.

They connect with us at the time, but humor is just so particular and fickle -- what made y...                    column          31 comments       Pile of Shame - Bite Me!

Chameleon There are at least four genres of anime that, no matter what anybody does, always seem to completely fall on their face when released in the West: sports, realistic military, yakuza and yankee (juvenile delinquent) shows. These were discovered through a lot of trial and error in the early...                    column          18 comments       Pile of Shame - The Tibetan Dog   2014 Sep  3, 00:21 18 comments                 anime    An underappreciated Madhouse feature from 2011 featuring a boy and his dog in the harsh terrain of Tibet. ―  The Tibetan Dog Japanese/Chinese co-productions don't happen very often.

Manzai routines are high-speed, rapid-fire conversations between one person, who's an idiot or a weirdo of some kind (boke), and a straight man (tsukkomi), who's constantly mut...                    column          32 comments       Pile of Shame - MARCO: 3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother   2014 Aug  6, 02:40 32 comments                 anime    Justin takes a look at a remake of Takahata's World Masterpiece Theater classic.

Because every little girl loves stories about dying tragically. ―  Full Moon o Sagashite I often joke that I love shows about children suffering.

Does it stand up? Justin finds out. ―  3x3 EYES Yuzo Takada was never really a big name among American otaku, but back in the 90s his stuff ranked as some of the most popular anime of its day, including Blue Seed, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku, and this -- 3x3 EYES, a dark and gory adventure OAV that once adorned a good numbe...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Legend of the Dragon Kings   2014 Apr 30, 00:00 20 comments                 anime    A highly mediocre adaptation of a best-selling book series that was illustrated by Yoshitaka Amano and CLAMP. The anime looks nothing like that, of course. ―  Legend of the Dragon Kings(A.K.A.

Dark Warrior (AKA Makyu Senjo) is one of those, seemingly having made zero impact on fans upon its re...                    column          20 comments       Pile of Shame - Goddamn!!   2014 Mar 19, 06:39 20 comments                 anime    A rally car racing OAV that, aside from the provocative name, doesn't make much of an impact. ―  Goddamn!! Kaoru Shintani has never had much of an American fanbase.

The rest of the team is all guys, but they don't stand a chance against the tomboy, and politely bow out. In addition to being fearfullly strong, Natsuki is also the protog...                    column          13 comments       Pile of Shame - Seven Cities Story   2014 Jan 22, 01:00 13 comments                 anime    A two-part OAV that tries to transplant Legend of Galactic Heroes onto a sideways-rotated Earth, and succeeds only in being dull and confusing. ―  Seven Cities Story One day, with no warning, the Earth's polar axis shifts 90 degrees, shaking up human civilization like an Etch-A-Sketch and killing everybody.

The Life of an Amorous Man) I first saw The Sensualist as a fuzzy VHS tape when I was a teenager. While it's ostensibly an adult work, it never seemed lurid or arousing to me. Rather, it held this strange transcendent beauty.

Japan's fully-entrenched organized crime families and organizations, and their connections with everything from banking to entertainment to politics show us Japan at its most corrupt and embarrassing.

I mean that honestly.

News Uchū Nanchara Kotetsu-kun Anime's Video Reveals New Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-01 19:15 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Aika Kobayashi performs new theme song ""MI-RA-I miracle circle"" for ongoing children's anime    Kadokawa began streaming a new promotional video for the ongoing television anime of Yūji Nishimura's web manga Uchū Nanchara Kotetsu-kun on Wednesday, which reveals and previews the anime's new theme song ""MI-RA-I miracle circle"" by Aika Kobayashi.      The weekly anime premiered on the NHK-E channel in April 2021.    The manga follows the daily life of Kotetsu-kun, who aspires to be an astronaut, and friends at the Animal Space Academy as they all pursue their dreams.    Hazumu Sakuta (Ōya-san to Boku, How Clumsy you are, Miss Ueno, Neko no Dayan) is directing the anime at Fanworks (Aggretsuko, Sumikko Gurashi: Tobidasu Ehon to Himitsu no Ko). Yoichi Kato (Yo-kai Watch, Space Brothers) is writing the scripts.    Nishimura launched the manga on August 6, 2019, just after the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, and has since posted a chapter every other Monday for free.

News Aksys Games to Release Jack Jeanne Switch Game in English in 2023   posted on 2022-03-31 23:45 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Release windows for Horgihugh and Friends, Undernauts revealed    Aksys Games announced during the New Game! Plus Expo event that it will release the Jack Jeanne game, Broccoli's collaboration project with Tokyo Ghoul manga creator Sui Ishida, for Nintendo Switch in English in 2023.    The company also revealed the following release dates and windows:    Horgihugh and Friends for Nintendo Switch - June 16   Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi for PlayStation 5 - summer 2022   RICO London for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One - April 28    Aksys Games describes Jack Jeanne:  Kisa is about to give up her dream of becoming an actor when she is given the opportunity to attend the prestigious All Boys Drama School that she has always admired. She is granted admission with two conditions: be chosen as the lead in the final performance and hide her identity as a girl! Competition at the school is fierce and the rivalry is real! Will Kisa be able to forge powerful bonds with her all-male classmates while competing against them? Will she be cast in the lead role in the final performance at the end of the year all while keeping her secret?  Jack Jeanne's official Twitter account previously revealed earlier this month that the game would get releases in English and Traditional Chinese. The game's UI and text will get English and Chinese translations but the voice acting and music will remain in Japanese in the localized releases.    The game launched for Nintendo Switch in Japan in March 2021 after two delays.    The game has both visual novel and rhythm game elements, and centers on the theater and a drama school setting. Broccoli stated the game has ""20 novels"" worth of story. The game's main scenario is fully voiced.    Ishida is credited with the original work and character designs, and he also worked on the world design, in-game illustrations, and insert song lyrics for the game. Shin Towada (Tokyo Ghoul novel series) penned the game's scenario alongside Ishida. Akira Kosemura composed the music. Lownine is credited for concept art, while Seishiro is credited for choreography. Broccoli developed the game in collaboration with Happinet.

She is granted admission with two conditions: be chosen as the lead in the final performance and hide her identity as a girl! Competition at the school is fierce and the rivalry is real! Will Kisa be able to forge powerful bonds with her all-male classmates while competing against them? Will she be cast in the lead role in the final performance at the end of the year all while keeping her secret?  Jack Jeanne's official Twitter account previously revealed earlier this month that the game would get releases in English and Traditional Chinese. The game's UI and text will get English and Chinese translations but the voice acting and music will remain in Japanese in the localized releases.    The game launched for Nintendo Switch in Japan in March 2021 after two delays.    The game has both visual novel and rhythm game elements, and centers on the theater and a drama school setting. Broccoli stated the game has ""20 novels"" worth of story. The game's main scenario is fully voiced.    Ishida is credited with the original work and character designs, and he also worked on the world design, in-game illustrations, and insert song lyrics for the game. Shin Towada (Tokyo Ghoul novel series) penned the game's scenario alongside Ishida. Akira Kosemura composed the music. Lownine is credited for concept art, while Seishiro is credited for choreography. Broccoli developed the game in collaboration with Happinet.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon.

Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus.

Review   by Nicholas Dupree, Mar 27th 2022       Soul Eater - The Perfect Edition GN 4-6                      Synopsis:             Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.      Review:         Synopsis:        Medusa's scheme is barreling forward, and it's left to Maka, Soul, and their fellow students to stop her servants from awakening the hellacious Kishin sealed beneath Death City. But standing between our heroes and their goal is a rematch with the deranged Demon Sword Ragnarok and his unhinged Meister, Crona. Can Maka and Soul overcome the foe who all but slaughtered them before, even as the malicious black blood in Soul's body continues to fester? If they can't, a madness 800 years in the making will be unleashed upon an unwitting world.     Review:            Volume four of The Perfect Edition sees Soul Eater in pure, shonen action mode. It's the classic setup of an evil villain waiting at the end of a gauntlet of enemies, with each of our major characters getting a battle against an established baddie as they duke it out for the fate of the world. The main event is the rematch between Maka, Soul, and the Ragnarok duo, and it's some Grade A shonen fighting goodness. While the various beats it hits are pretty standard, they're delivered with the series' signature style and Ohkubo's exaggerated choreography, and thus land with a ton of impact, especially once “mad” Maka takes over and delivers some of the goofiest creepy-cute faces ever put to page.    Though the fight itself ends on a bit of a let down. Much is made about Maka resonating with Soul and giving into the black blood, but that ends up not mattering much as the fight resolves in a classic power of friendship conclusion. Don't get me wrong: Crona's backstory is emotionally affecting, and Maka reaching out to them with unconditional compassion is probably the best character moment in the series so far. But it doesn't quite match the tension and personal stakes that led up to it, and it leaves the whole black blood storyline feeling anticlimactic when it should be a huge turning point.    But the star of the show here is the Kishin himself, as the rest of the cast predictably fail to prevent his awakening. The sequence of Free and Eruka approaching his resting place is the most palpable horror in the manga so far, and it's followed up by a gloriously gross sequence of body horror as the Kishin literally puts himself back together skin-first. In classic Big Bad fashion he crushes our heroes with barely a whisper, and the only downside is that his fight with Lord Death has to be cut short so we can set up for the next arc. Again, that's predictable for this kind of shonen story, but it's still a tiny bit deflating to close things out with the new, dangerous villain running away. This is also supposed to be a sample of what Lord Death is capable of himself, and it winds up a pretty underwhelming showing for the guy.    Fittingly, Volume 5 is all about establishing the new conflict, introducing new characters on both sides as Ashura's awakening stirs up the rest of the world. On the good guys side, we're introduced to three of Lord Death's other Death Scythe weapons, each with their own quirks and powers. And like much of Ohkubo's extended cast, they're a mixed bag to start, as we initially learn about them through their singular comedic gimmicks. Marie Mjolnir has a great design and likable personality, but she's also obsessed with finding a husband, and that joke gets old fast. Similarly, Justin Law is a great fighter and has an interesting backstory as a solo Demon Weapon who became a Death Scythe at just 13, but his joke about always having his earbuds in wears out its welcome in record time. Azusa Yumi has probably the coolest powers of any Weapon outside Tsubaki, but is defined as the by-the-books straightwoman of the group and doesn't get much to do initially. They're not terrible, but by the end of the volume I was really wishing to see them get serious and stop goofing around. This formula works well with the kids because we already know their personalities beyond the tired gimmicks, but it's a chore to get through with a ton of new people.    The real treats come with the new villains introduced. Ashura himself is still off in the distance, but his resurrection spurs the revival of Arachne, a powerful spider-themed witch who immediately steals any page she's on. Her subordinate weapon, Giriko, leaves a little to be desired, as he initially just feels like a meaner version of Free. But his chainsaw powers make for some wild fights that more than made up for his retread personality. Their diminutive old butler(?) Mr. Mosquito has a striking, cartoony design that makes him stand out among Ohkubo's other villains, and his condescending attitude towards Giriko breathes a lot of life to this new primary villain group. Add in Medusa returning – by possessing the body of an innocent little girl, no less – and we have a great new villain group even before the return of Mifune, who's been forced to fight on their side under threat to Angela's life.    The following volume is more scattered, as we now need to introduce a common goal for the sides to scrap over while Ashura remains a looming hypothetical threat. This comes in the form of a search for the Demon Tools, designed centuries ago by a mysterious sorcerer named Eibon and scattered across the world. Volume 6 is bookended with two different quests for these tools, and makes for some of the best action in the series so far.    Kid's skateboard race against an enchanted train across the desert is a real highlight. It's a fast-paced and unique action setpiece, coupled with a three-way fight between Kid and both Arachne and Medusa's cronies that works as great spectacle and a nice highlight for the main kid who had the least to do in the previous arc. The closing battle in a snowy maelstrom doesn't get a conclusion in this volume, but it's got a lot of great, classic shonen moments for some of the side cast. Sid and his partner Mira, along with Death Scythe Azusa, have a fantastic and tactical fight against Mifune that shows off Ohkubo's improved eye for melee combat, packed with lots of inventive twists involving both the snowy landscape and Sid's zombie body. Meanwhile a secondary team of DWMA students actually get to shine instead of Maka and co, which is always welcome in battle series with huge casts. The big, important fight is of course being saved for our main crew, but it's still nice that Kirikou and his team can show off their stuff for a bit.    Outside of the action, the forces of darkness are still active in other ways. Ashura's awakening is causing a stirring of madness among the general populous, and especially in Dr. Stein, who's slowly being consumed by his inner darkness. But the real kicker is when Medusa slithers back into Crona's life just as they're starting to make friends at DWMA, and convinces her abused child to betray them and become her spy inside the school. After the progress we saw Crona make after their fight with Maka, it's genuinely heartbreaking to see this backslide, retreating into the madness and fear that once defined their entire personhood. It's by far the most affecting character arc right now by miles, easily eclipsing the rather pat teamwork lessons Maka and Black Star deal with during a training chapter here.    Unfortunately there is one big, obnoxious zit on volume six's face, and its name is Excalibur. For reasons I can't comprehend, the story interrupts itself for a full-length comedy chapter about Hero, a total gag character, teaming up with Excalibur to take over the school and get revenge on everyone who looks down on him. As somebody who also loves committing to overlong comedic bits for the sole purpose of annoying the reader, I can at least appreciate the idea behind Excalibur, but that doesn't make his dialogue any less of a chore to sit through. Add in some much un-needed skirt flipping and boob groping jokes and you have a chapter comprising all the worst elements of Soul Eater here, breaking up the rising tension of its story and character arcs. Maybe this would have worked better in the original collected volumes, but with The Perfect Edition's expanded chapter count per-book, it absolutely kills the tension while reading the volume on its own.    Other than that blemish, these volumes represent a solid, if somewhat inconsistent, new arc for Soul Eater's overarching story. The biggest complaint – besides Excalibur – is that the expanding scope of the story leaves Maka and Soul feeling underutilized and out of focus. That's perhaps to be expected as a series with such a huge cast goes on, but after their partnership defined so much of the conflict before this, it feels like the series doesn't quite know what to do with them besides occasionally hinting at the return of the black blood demon. But on its own, this is an effective, often thrilling chunk of storytelling and offers some fantastic highlights.
