For starters, “lolicon” or “roricon” is short for “Lolita Complex.” “Lolita” as a term for an under-age girl comes from the book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.

Justin looks back on old video rooms and industry panels to find out. ―  Fred asked: I've only been going to conventions for the past year or so, and I'm curious how they've evolved over time. You'd actually be surprised by how little has changed for anime conventions over the years.

It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling. Sometimes, events may flow naturally from one chapter to the next. Other times, we get a chapter that is unrelated to any overarching narrative. And there are also one-shots...                    review          11 comments       Sing a Bit of Harmony   Jan 23, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Ahead of its opening in North American theaters, find out why Kim Morrissy calls the new film by Time of Eve director Yasuhiro Yoshiura a ""breezy family-friendly film that's easy to recommend to pretty much anyone."" ― In a year with both Mamoru Hosoda's BELLE and WIT Studio's Vivy -Fluorite Eye's Song-, a story about a singing AI robot doesn't seem like much of a novelty.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade.

GN 1 The manga starts off with questionable premise (a tenant agrees to exchange sex for roof over her head) but what you'll discover beneath that façade is an account of the desperate lengths that people will go to find a connection in a society.

It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    review          12 comments       The History of Hentai Manga   Mar 17, 00:00 12 comments                 novels    Kimi Rito digs deep into the tropes of anime's salacious sister medium, from tracking down the hentai's early manga creators to going back even further to the shunga of the Edo period. ― If there is a form of media, no matter how maligned, there is a scholar or critic (or both) dedicated to examining it.

Written out, the story sounds like a cookie-cutter post-Free! sports anime, with a young man stumbling into a team of quirky but talented underdogs determined to finally make it to the Big Sports Competiti...                    review                Alice in Kyoto Forest GN 1   Feb  3, 01:00                 manga    We can tell very quickly that she's no longer in our world, not just because most of the people are gadding about in kimono and hand-drawn carts, but because the tails that some people have are clearly not a fashion accessory. ― If the name Mai Mochizuki sounds familiar, that's because this is her second English-language release: she's also the author of the Holmes of Kyoto light mysteries. But even ...                    review          9 comments       World Trigger Season 3   Feb  2, 01:00 9 comments                 anime    Lack of a concrete ending notwithstanding, this is still an excellent season overall, and definitely worth watching if you've previously enjoyed World Trigger. ― It finally happened. After a six-year hiatus, a split cour, and at least two weather-related delays, World Trigger has finally been able to conclude the Rank Wars arc. It feels like forever ago that Daisuke Ashihara took his sci-fi battle se...                    review          4 comments       Vampire Hunter D: Message from Mars GN   Feb  1, 01:00 4 comments                 manga    Currently up on KickStarter (and having far surpassed its goal with over US$170,000 pledged), check out the comic adaptation Rebecca Silverman calls a ""successful adaptation"" of Kikuchi's original work. ― You may have heard of this project. Stranger Comics initially announced it in 2016 with a planned Kickstarter goal, only for a variety of issues, including the pandemic, to force a wait. Now it's fi...                    review          7 comments       Semelparous GN 1   Jan 31, 01:00 7 comments                 manga    It feels more like the book is interested in gratuitous girl-on-girl groping than in exploring or creating a relationship. ― If you are considering reading Semelparous strictly for the yuri content, there are a few things you should be aware of. The main one is that this is one of those yuri titles that goes in for some truly ridiculous breast physics and male gaze trappings – obviously not all lesbi...                    review          14 comments       Kiruru Kill Me GN 1   Jan 30, 01:00 14 comments                 manga    it was only a matter of time before some enterprising storyteller took the phrase ""God, I want her to kill me"" to its ultimately literal conclusion. ― It's the modern mantra elicited upon seeing a pretty lady: ""God, I want her to kill me.""

When I was given a chance to review this series, all I wanted was a sweet, gay romance between a shy and bubbly high school student and her cool athletic ...                    review          9 comments       Vampire Dies in No Time 1-12 Streaming   Jan 25, 01:00 9 comments                 anime    The Vampire Dies in No Time is precisely what you'd expect from a series that ends with a dance-off. It's silly, features an inexplicably furry armadillo, and involves vampiric veggies that are scarier to cook than live lobster ― If there's one thing you can say about The Vampire Dies in No Time, it's that it absolutely doesn't lie: within the first few minutes Draluc, the main but by no means only v...                    review          2 comments       Frieren: Beyond Journey's End GN 2   Jan 24, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    All in all, this volume of Frieren: Beyond Journey's End turns out to be just as good—if not better—than the first. ― In general, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a manga that utilizes both serialized and standalone storytelling. Sometimes, events may flow naturally from one chapter to the next. Other times, we get a chapter that is unrelated to any overarching narrative. And there are also one-shots...                    review          11 comments       Sing a Bit of Harmony   Jan 23, 01:00 11 comments                 anime    Ahead of its opening in North American theaters, find out why Kim Morrissy calls the new film by Time of Eve director Yasuhiro Yoshiura a ""breezy family-friendly film that's easy to recommend to pretty much anyone."" ― In a year with both Mamoru Hosoda's BELLE and WIT Studio's Vivy -Fluorite Eye's Song-, a story about a singing AI robot doesn't seem like much of a novelty.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    review          8 comments       Selection Project   Jan 17, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    When it's not bogging itself down with tonal filler, Selection Project is filling the central character conflict of its reality-show story with some of the wildest plot twists I've encountered in a series like this recently. ― A crowded field like idol anime means a series needs to have its own particular identity to stand out, and Selection Project's approach seems to be to pitch itself as at least ...                    review          3 comments       Shikizakura Episodes 1-12   Jan 16, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    As far as what it's playing with in terms of influence and genre stylings, Shikizakura is tokusatsu as all heck. ― Tokusatsu has enjoyed a run of increased availability and visibility among English-speaking audiences, particularly those adjacent to anime fan circles, for a good several years now.

There's a bunch of young teen girls getting involved in a vaguely shady (to adult viewers) company that turns them into idols with mysterious magic/technology, they coll...                    review          6 comments       Aggretsuko Season 4 Streaming   Dec 25, 01:00 6 comments                 anime    What started as a cute workplace comedy about anthropomorphic animals just trying to get by as Millennials in Japan has become a veritable soap opera of rocky relationships and biting social commentary. ― Each season of Netflix's Aggretsuko has felt more ambitious than the last.

Let me explain. If you've been following along with my prior reviews of the manga, you'll know that I regard volume 1 to be excellent, but still clearly ...                    review          5 comments       Shaman King Episodes 14-25   Dec 22, 01:00 5 comments                 anime    I'm happy to report that the second cour is an improvement in nearly every respect, and while I can't exactly peg this show as a “great” adaptation, it's at least started to shift the needle from bad to solid, and feels more confident. ― So the first cour of the Shaman King reboot stumbled pretty hard right out of the gate, and left me with a pretty bad first impression of what to expect out of this ...                    review          3 comments       Edens Zero Episodes 13-25   Dec 18, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    The world feels bigger and bigger with each new planet that we visit while also feeling darker and more selfish along the way. ― When Edens Zero first came out, it was admittedly very difficult for many people, myself included, to judge the series on its own terms. Coming off the heels of Hiro Mashima's very successful Fairy Tail, Edens Zero did have a lot to live up to because love or hate it, its p...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    review          15 comments       Macross Plus Movie Edition (Theatrical Release, 2021)   Dec 16, 04:00 15 comments                 anime    When three former friends reunite seven years after a horrific falling out, their pent up emotions threaten to spill out beyond the bounds of their tattered friendship and envelop the entire galaxy. ― It feels a bit surreal to be writing this, honestly. Macross is a property that has spent so long in licensing turmoil that, even months after it was announced some entries could finally make their way ...                    review          6 comments       Seaside Stranger GN 1   Dec 15, 01:00 6 comments                 manga    It's just as much about how Shun comes to understand that he deserves to be happy and that Mio truly does love him for (rather than in spite of) who he is. ― If ever there was a textbook example of a character suffering from internalized homophobia, it would be Shun. Although he seems to have known for much of his life that he was gay, Shun pushed that knowledge down, allowing himself to be caught up...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    review          8 comments       Reign of the Seven Spellblades Novel 2   Dec 13, 04:00 8 comments                 novels    This is not a series that enjoys revealing too much.

Novel 10   Dec 12, 01:00                 novels    But when it's on, it's on, and this volume, while not quite a return to the form of the earliest books, is definitely on the higher end of things. ― This is a series that has had its ups and downs. That's true of any series, really, but at times it feels more obvious with Katarina's exploits than some others. In large part that's because it was so abundantly clear when it kept going beyond where auth...                    review          2 comments       Skip and Loafer GN 1-2   Dec 11, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    At this point it seems as if Skip and Loafer is a pure comedy series. That's not entirely fair or true to say, although it is definitely a very funny two volumes. ― A quirky small-town country girl moves to Tokyo to start her exciting high school career. Is this Daytime Shooting Star? Or maybe Mucha Kucha Daisuki? Could it be Imadoki! Nowadays? No, this is Skip and Loafer, and while it certainly isn'...                    review          6 comments       Dropout Idol Fruit Tart   Dec 10, 01:00 6 comments                 anime    I dropped Dropout Idol Fruit Tart when it didn't grab my attention by episode 3.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

I mean, shonen demographic manga are also full of tropes but you can always find more entertainment in them in general compared to shojo manga.           I don't think that's fair. You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here.

This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

Like, I know that Crunchyroll is going to try to promote themselves as the future of anime streaming, but maybe they should try to avoid blatantly going ""Please allow us to become a literal monopoly"" with their messaging.

Nowadays they usually get Jdrama or movie adaptions.    Which as a big Shojo manga fan I would love to see change.    Also stating the appeal of well-produced romcoms.

You could easily say the same thing about shounen stuff (like battle shounen and the male power fantasy isekai trend). And saying ""you can always find more entertainment"" in shounen makes me feel like you don't like reading about female protagonists which star in most shoujos (most shounens have male protagonists).   I respect that you like what you like, but saying ""most shoujo is less fun than shounen"" just seems to be a rehash of ""it's for girls so therefore it's automatically worse.""    cchigu wrote:    Natsume Yuujinchou is one of a kind, probably my favorite shojo manga, I hope we keep getting the sequels for the anime.

Have you ever wondered what would have happened if Sony had not bought the Crunchyroll?  Instead of the demon slayer s2, my dress-up darling and kaguya-sama s2-s3, we was getting the second season of High Guardian Spice  Former Crunchyroll executives (now fired) invested on American political animation with money they received from their subscribers  Do not forget that funimation was in the fruits basket anime production committee and helped a lot to make this anime  Crunchyroll is helping the anime industry, and is even trying to get anime studios to pay more attention to genres like Shojo that are often overlooked (after Sony's acquisition)  And while streaming services like Netflix, which make billions of dollars, only make cheap CGI anime.  This is not a monopoly, this is a situation where no major streaming service pays attention to the anime industry and just wants to use the anime name.  And the only reason Crunchyroll is now focusing more on the anime industry itself is because it is a subsidiary of a Japanese company (Sony / Aniplex).

All ""shojo anime"" indicates is anime that is made primarily to appeal to the shojo (i.e. ""young woman"") demographic. In appealing to that demographic, though, there are many often-used tropes, concepts, & ideas, because they have been proven to consistently work, which in turn can also make ""shojo anime"" feel like a genre, in & of itself.   It really comes down to how you want to interpret it, and all Crunchyroll was saying was that they'd like to see companies produce more anime that appeals to that demographic, as the few that are getting made have been consistently doing better than expected, which shows that it's a larger demographic than the industry thinks.

First of all, High Guardian Spice isn't political, or at least your interpretation of the word. HGS was just a cartoon that got dealt a really bad hand in terms of both marketing, lack of money, and how CR treated all the staff that worked on it, something that the staff on said show have outright told people point blank multiple times online. Any flaws the show had were the result of CR not allowing the writers to go back and rectify them. The only reason the first initial trailer came out the way it did was that CR had the final say in how the show was marketed, not the creators, which the creators of Onyx Equinox flat-out confirmed. Also, the claim that Crunchyroll used subscribers' money to make HGS is a lie, as several articles confirmed that other companies gave CR funding to invest in both co-productions and original programming, one of which ANN even published on here. Seriously, do your research before going off on tangents like this.

The idea of the main character restarting life in a new and exciting world of fantasy is appealing to many viewers, and that demand has led to the subgenre developing its own set of tropes.  A popular trope within this subgenre is the process of the protagonist trying to find their way home. However, there are a rare few instances where they actually succeed in doing so.

RELATED: How the Shield Hero Anime Refined the Isekai Harem Concept  Re:Creators Turns the Tables on Classic Isekai                  Starting off with an unconventional and refreshing take on the isekai genre is Re:Creators. This series challenges the conventional trope of the underdog reincarnating into a fantasy world; this time, it’s the characters from fictional worlds who are out of place in the real world. Its unique concept and clever use of the reverse isekai genre make it one of the best isekai where the main characters return home.  The Devil Is a Part-Timer! Is a Gut-Busting Comedy Isekai                  Another trailblazer in this new concept of reverse isekai, like Re:Creators, is The Devil Is a Part-Timer. Taking on a more lighthearted and comedic tone, the story follows Satan as he navigates normal life as a part-time fast-food restaurant worker while trying to find his way back to hell. This anime combines comedic relief with epic fight scenes in a way that is not over the top, contributing to its worldwide popularity.
