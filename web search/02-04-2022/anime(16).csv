Interest Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   posted on 2022-03-31 23:23 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge           After a cryptic announcement that he was changing his name to ""Bonsoir Ikuhara,"" the Utena and Penguindrum director revealed he's participating in a new music project. Ikuhara is teaming up with Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.       The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars.    Ikuhara first announced the name change on his social media accounts with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

Interest Kunihiko 'Bonsoir' Ikuhara's Name Change Tied to New Music Project   posted on 2022-03-31 23:23 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge           After a cryptic announcement that he was changing his name to ""Bonsoir Ikuhara,"" the Utena and Penguindrum director revealed he's participating in a new music project. Ikuhara is teaming up with Bonjour Suzuki (Yuri Kuma Arashi opening theme) and Elise Shōjoshiki indie band member Teiko (Sarazanmai's Sara Azuma) to form the group Teiko BonBon. Ikuhara is serving as the group's music producer, Teiko will perform the vocals, and Suzuki will direct the music.       The group's first album Kimi no Seishun wa Kagayaite Iru ka will be released on June 8 with two alternate album jackets with art by Kei Mochizuki. Teiko will cover nine songs selected by Ikuhara with the theme of ""fighting girls."" The track selection includes songs from Ashita no Joe, Godzilla vs. Hedorah, Choujinki Metalder, Ultraman Z, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Revolutionary Girl Utena, and Sakura Wars.    Ikuhara first announced the name change on his social media accounts with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November.

News Laid-Back Camp Movie's Teaser Previews Cast, Now Grown-Up   posted on 2022-03-31 18:22 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Song artists, more staff, designs also posted for story about building campsite    The official website for the anime of Afro's Yurucamp (Yurukyan△, Laid-Back Camp Δ) manga posted the teaser trailer, teaser visual, and character visuals for the upcoming Eiga Yurukyan△ (Laid-Back Camp Movie)  on Thursday. The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year.

The teaser trailer and visuals show the familiar characters, now grown-up, reuniting to construct a campsite. The trailer also posted more of the staff and the theme song artists.         Nadeshiko is now working at an outdoors goods store in Tokyo.   Rin is now working as an editor at a publisher in Nagoya.    Chiaki worked at a Tokyo event organizer, but made a figurative U-turn to work at Yamanashi prefecture's tourism promotion organization.     Aoi now works as an instructor at a Yamanashi elementary school.    Saitō now works as a trimmer at a Yokohama pet salon.     Singer Asaka performs the opening theme song ""Sun Is Coming Up"" as heard in the teaser above. Eri Sasaki performs the ending theme song ""Mimosa.""    The newly announced staff members are:    Prop Design: Miho Imoto, Noriko Tsutsumiya   Mechanical Design: Daisuke Endō, Hajime Maruo  Color Key Artist: Taeko Mizuno (Studio Road) Art Director: Yoshimi Umino (Production ai) Compositing Director of Photography: Hiroaki Tanaka (Studio Twinkle) Digital Work: C-Station Digital  CG Work: Yoshifumi Hirakawa (M.S.C) Sound Director: Takeshi Takadera  Sound Production: HALF H·P STUDIO  Music: Akiyuki Tateyama  Music Production: MAGES.    The film staff has been posting a series of ""candid photo visuals"" of the characters in their daily life before the film opens. The first visual features Nadeshiko Kagamihara hanging out a sleeping bag and blankets to dry on her veranda, and the second features Rin Shima taking a walk past skyscrapers at night, her warm breath visible in the chilly air. The third visual features Chiaki Ōgaki sitting by the roadside to drink, while flags of the real-life Taihaku Cherry Blossom Festival wave in the background.  The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.

The fourth visual features Aoi Inuyama, and the fifth features Ena Saitō and her pet dog Chikuwa sitting on a bench apparently in a train station:                 The television anime's five main cast members are reprising their roles, and the staff members returning from the television anime include:    Director: Yoshiaki Kyougoku  Script: Jin Tanaka, Mutsumi Ito  Character Design: Mutsumi Sasaki  Production: DeNA Contents Planning Department Animation Production: C-Station    Afro said that the staff checked back with the manga creator at nearly every step of the production from the earliest script draft and designs. The creator noted that the characters are a little bit older as well as the personal anticipation at seeing what even Afro has not seen yet. Director Yoshiaki Kyougoku thanked the fans for their support which made this film happen, and joked about once again going location-scouting and eating delicious camp food while making anime.    Shochiku is distributing the film, which will open on July 1.    The anime adapts Afro's ""slow outdoor manga"" which follows two young women. Rin likes to go camping by herself along the lakes that provide a scenic view of Mt. Fuji. Nadeshiko loves to take cycling trips by herself to places where she can see Mt. Fuji. After they meet, Rin and Nadeshiko take camping trips, eat cup ramen together, and enjoy the scenery.    The first anime premiered in January 2018, and Crunchyroll streamed the 12-episode series as it aired. The ROOM CAMP (Heya Camp) short anime spinoff premiered in January 2020. The second season of the anime premiered in January and ended in April. The cast and staff announced the movie in an October 2018 event.    Afro launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Forward magazine in 2015. Yen Press began releasing the manga in English in March 2018.    The anime's first smartphone game is slated for iOS and Android devices this year. The anime already inspired  MAGES' Yurucamp Have a Nice Day! game for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch last November. Gemdrops released the Laid-Back Camp - Virtual - Lake Motosu (Yurucamp Virtual Camp Motosuko-hen) VR game in March 2021, and released the Laid-Back Camp - Virtual - Fumoto Campsite (Yurucamp Virtual Camp Fumoto Camp Jō-hen) VR game on April 8.

I'm glad to have Arifureta back looking better than ever.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

My main concern is how the second season will handle the content, that was skipped over in the first season.  Since the first season was nothing more than a travelogue.   spoiler[They glossed over Verbergen and skipped the encounters with the Hoelscher Empire.]  It would be a shame if they excised these from the anime, since spoiler[ the blood bath in the Empire was a glorious moment in the light novel]      Back to top                  Cryten    Joined: 19 Jan 2019 		    Posts: 541       Posted: Fri Jan 21, 2022 6:13 am            Well I cant get as much fun dunking on the series anymore, since its actually competent now even if it doesnt stand out. Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.  Those sorts of Easter eggs are always fun to catch when watching a show.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats.

I imagine it was more of an intentional casting because Alicia Florence from the Aria franchise, also played by Sayaka Ohara, was the direct inspiration for Remia.

I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats.

Without it I fear that the only interesting part was the slime / jelly fish monster with nothing for them to kill. I am glad they decided to leave as the show rarely considers battles where the Chuni team does anything but overwhelm their opponents.   The speed of the naval battle moment really makes me wonder what actually happened. I mean if magic can destroy the illusion couldnt they just use the smallest beads of magic and spread them out? But no we just get a quip about destroying them all and cut to blank. That was unsatisfying to me. I like battles where triumph comes through technique.   Its been a few years since season 1, can someone reminds me how he got the crystal eye thing? I dont remember it ever being a factor before now. It really is very sterotypically chuni. The eye of darkness that must remain sealed kinda thing but with a cheap pirate eyepatch from a kids dress up store.

I'm generally pretty ""done"" with anime fighting as it is, but this show's feels especially perfunctory. No passion, no stakes, no creativity. They really brought out the level of excitement ""I guess I have to go farm 100 lava snakes at Hot Mountain for this quest"" or ""I wonder what it looks like when I use this new weapon"" triggers when you encounter it in an MMO. Digging a hole came across as more interesting.   I stick around for the slightly-pointy banter, though, and hey, maybe what I assume is some kind of Angel Beam heralds something a bit more gripping.

Actually from the preview I thought it might be a bunch of stills again but we are normally getting at least a few frames of swinging a weapon animation now. Its a plus!   Though without it being atrocious it feels a bit more average now. Perhaps that is because we have had a few more of the chuni style wacky leads in the last 2 years. Like Kemono Michi, Combatants will be dispatched and quite a few I rule out as close to chuni but not overtly such as Reincarnated as a Spider and Fruit of Evolution.   For ep 2, I dont believe for a single second that Hajime could be threatened. More likely the old staple of getting his reward stolen to try and create a credible threat. Though I think the series would more likely go for just overwhelming a foe who thinks he's got him on the hop.

The pacing so far has been fairly steady, and with only 12 aired episodes listed volume 6 would probably be a better stopping point.  As far as the spoiler[Empire] is concerned, I wouldn't be too surprised if at least spoiler[Gahard] was retroactively introduced here in the next couple of episodes when the story checks in on the Hero party side since spoiler[they don't have much to do for awhile].   So far, I've been enjoying the second season.  Though far from top tier, the animation quality is noticeably improved, and the writing doesn't seem to be in as big of a hurry as season 1 to speed run through the content.  The new opening and ending themes are quite good, and Ryou Takahashi's work on the bgms is as on point as always.  Of course, the return of the weekly Twitter shorts are also a welcome injection of comedy into the story.  We'll have to see where things go, but from the first two episodes at least there's plenty of room for some cautious optimism.

I tolerate the light novel and manga enough but never watched the first season, so my impression is that they upped the edgelord aspects but toned down the sex and violence.

I really enjoyed the first season. my only worry with the first episode is they haven't done any explaining so anyone who never read the LN, Manga, Watched the first season won't have any good understandings of what's going on.    Looking at the first episode without any context it's hard to follow along. Hopefully that improves in subsequent episodes (only watched the first so far).

Wished that the OP was a bit more exciting, but at least this OP was slightly better than the first season's horrible OP.

It was nice to see some Tio spotlight and to see her proclaim her love for Hajime. I wonder if Shea will get a spotlight episode this season.    Seems like there's intrigue back with Hajime's old classmates...I almost forgot about the conspiracy going on. Dude really just doesn't get how little Hajime cares about the attempted murder or Kaori going along with him, but now he's basically asking for Hajime to kill him.   Shizuku's one weakness...cats. Catgirl Shizuku was adorable.      Back to top                  Fallout3Boi    Joined: 05 Feb 2022 		    Posts: 1       Posted: Sat Feb 05, 2022 5:14 am            My only thought? Remia's hair looks darker in the LN.   On another note though, at this point in season 2. Remia is only pretending to like Hajime as so not to hurt Myuu's feelings.

That's couple goals.    Poor Shea gives up her blood and then has to catch Hajime and Yue at the end of their lovemaking. Throw her a bone, Hajime!   I love how Kaori finally gets her moment with Hajime only for Tio to interrupt it and shove Hajime into her boobs.   Sayaka Ohara playing a hot anime mom. It's almost becoming her thing as much as it is Kikuko Inoue's. What's funny is I was reminded on reddit that she had already played Shea's mom in a flashback, which implies that either they forgot about it and just cast her as another mom or Sayaka Ohara is going to play every characters' mom.    Really curious where the intrigue in the kingdom is going and if it'll intersect with Hajime's story at all this season...and now Shizuku knows Hajime did something to Ai-chan.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.

Ranking of Kings Episodes 22-23  by Lynzee Loveridge, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 22 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 23 of Ranking of Kings ?                     Community score: 4.4           It's time for the epilogue of Ranking of Kings. Bosse is dead, Daida is back in control of his faculties, Ouken is compressed inside of a giant boulder, and all the major players are alive barring a few missing limbs. The final two episodes seek to put a bow on most of the straggling threads and reassert the series' overall thesis of abandoning malice for empathy and forgiveness. Ranking of Kings has long been married to this idea that there is no true villainy (sans episode 18) and while I can appreciate its commitment, it's asking a lot of its audience in these final moments.    Primarily, it's asking us to forgive Miranjo, a horrifically abused woman who nonetheless orchestrated the murder of Bojji's mom, influenced Daida to have his brother assassinated, attempted to have Hiling torn apart by mind-controlled beasts, unleashed Ouken on the general populous, recommended the process of stealing Bojji's physical strength, and betrayed Daida so he would be possessed by his father. And now Daida wants everyone to forgive her and intends on marrying her. Miranjo could best be described as Daida's mentor/step-sister/step-mom, and I couldn't even estimate their age gap. This isn't so much a case of ""she's too old for him"" as Miranjo, despite all her scheming, has seemed somewhat emotionally immature throughout the series.    The issue is that I've head-canoned Daida as maybe 14 throughout most of the series and I take his love confession with about the same amount of seriousness. I can believe that he already had a trusting relationship with Miranjo over the course of her mentoring him while she was in the mirror. I can believe that he gained a sense of protectiveness over her after he witnessed her childhood and spent time with that child version of her inside of his father's memories. However, I don't perceive Daida as a ""man"" and so all of his proclamations, as genuine as they seem to him, still sound like they're coming from a little kid.    I'm also just a little pissed off that his recklessness lost Despa his chance to cure his brother and likely set into motion what would be the next act of the story: Desha's choice to accept a gift from the vault. While this part of Ranking of Kings' world is still a mystery, we can infer that the Ranking system and the cursed treasures are likely some kind of ploy by the gods to keep the humans from gaining too much power and overthrowing them. I'd love to see this expanded on in a second season, but until then, this development remains an enticing cliffhanger.    Also, while it's entirely out of left field, shout out to Kingbo for arriving late to the party just to dropkick Ouken's head into a lake. Chaotic king shit.    Most of the final episode is an extremely well-animated (watch for the many POV shots) bit of closure with a minor conflict. We see Bojji accepted as king (hurray!) and that being king is kind of boring (bureaucracy, boo!) especially without your best friend by your side. Kage takes off for a bit of ham-fisted emotional conflict in the final moments but it isn't all just to kill time: it also gives Bojji and Hiling a moment to reconcile some of the emotional damage that her step-son carries and she reassures him that it is okay for him to want things for himself even when he has a responsibility to his people. The result? Bojji still has a lot of the world left to see and he's fine letting his brother manage things in his stead while he goes off on the journey he always wanted, with his best friend by his side.    When I first started reviewing this series, I talked about how Bojji held special importance to me as a parent. His journey has unfolded over the last half year and I often found it reaffirming. If Bojji could find a best friend like Kage, a supportive ray of sunshine, then my son could, too. The series often showed that even in a world with unimaginable depths of cruelty, a community can still be forged in empathy and kindness. I think all of us need to know that.
