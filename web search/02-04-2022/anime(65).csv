Manga on April 4   posted on 2022-04-01 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime debuts on April 3    This year's 17th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine revealed on Monday that Naoya Sugita (Majin Bone, Muttsuri Shinken, Zan) will launch a new manga for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime series in the may issue of Saikyō Jump, which will release on April 4. Masahiro Hikokubo is credited for Duel composition for the manga.    Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!!, the eighth main anime series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, will premiere on April 3. The anime is set in the birthplace of the popular card game Rush Duel, Mutsuba-cho. Twins Yūhi and Yuamu run UTS (Uchūjin Trouble Sōdansho or Alien Trouble Consulting), a group that (supposedly) gets rid of troublesome aliens from distant sectors of the galaxy via Rush Duel battles. However, one day, they find an actual spaceship, and inside they find Yudias, an alien from the Belgar Cluster. Yudias has come to Earth to search for Rush Duel to hopefully lead him and his friends (who have been chased out of their star system) into a new future. However, Yudias himself knows nothing about Rush Duel. Yūhi then challenges Yudias to a duel. The anime will feature an alien as a protagonist for the first time in the franchise.    Shueisha's V Jump magazine had revealed March 19 that the magazine will publish a new separate manga in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise starting in the June issue on April 21. The magazine stated the manga is related to the Official Card Game, which is abbreviated as ""OCG.""    The manga will serialize alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures manga. Masashi Sato launched the manga in June 2019. The series is also related to the franchise's Official Card Game.

Manga on April 4   posted on 2022-04-01 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime debuts on April 3    This year's 17th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine revealed on Monday that Naoya Sugita (Majin Bone, Muttsuri Shinken, Zan) will launch a new manga for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime series in the may issue of Saikyō Jump, which will release on April 4. Masahiro Hikokubo is credited for Duel composition for the manga.    Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!!, the eighth main anime series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, will premiere on April 3. The anime is set in the birthplace of the popular card game Rush Duel, Mutsuba-cho. Twins Yūhi and Yuamu run UTS (Uchūjin Trouble Sōdansho or Alien Trouble Consulting), a group that (supposedly) gets rid of troublesome aliens from distant sectors of the galaxy via Rush Duel battles. However, one day, they find an actual spaceship, and inside they find Yudias, an alien from the Belgar Cluster. Yudias has come to Earth to search for Rush Duel to hopefully lead him and his friends (who have been chased out of their star system) into a new future. However, Yudias himself knows nothing about Rush Duel. Yūhi then challenges Yudias to a duel. The anime will feature an alien as a protagonist for the first time in the franchise.    Shueisha's V Jump magazine had revealed March 19 that the magazine will publish a new separate manga in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise starting in the June issue on April 21. The magazine stated the manga is related to the Official Card Game, which is abbreviated as ""OCG.""    The manga will serialize alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures manga. Masashi Sato launched the manga in June 2019. The series is also related to the franchise's Official Card Game.

Manga on April 4   posted on 2022-04-01 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime debuts on April 3    This year's 17th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine revealed on Monday that Naoya Sugita (Majin Bone, Muttsuri Shinken, Zan) will launch a new manga for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime series in the may issue of Saikyō Jump, which will release on April 4. Masahiro Hikokubo is credited for Duel composition for the manga.    Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!!, the eighth main anime series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, will premiere on April 3. The anime is set in the birthplace of the popular card game Rush Duel, Mutsuba-cho. Twins Yūhi and Yuamu run UTS (Uchūjin Trouble Sōdansho or Alien Trouble Consulting), a group that (supposedly) gets rid of troublesome aliens from distant sectors of the galaxy via Rush Duel battles. However, one day, they find an actual spaceship, and inside they find Yudias, an alien from the Belgar Cluster. Yudias has come to Earth to search for Rush Duel to hopefully lead him and his friends (who have been chased out of their star system) into a new future. However, Yudias himself knows nothing about Rush Duel. Yūhi then challenges Yudias to a duel. The anime will feature an alien as a protagonist for the first time in the franchise.    Shueisha's V Jump magazine had revealed March 19 that the magazine will publish a new separate manga in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise starting in the June issue on April 21. The magazine stated the manga is related to the Official Card Game, which is abbreviated as ""OCG.""    The manga will serialize alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures manga. Masashi Sato launched the manga in June 2019. The series is also related to the franchise's Official Card Game.

Manga on April 4   posted on 2022-04-01 21:15 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime debuts on April 3    This year's 17th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine revealed on Monday that Naoya Sugita (Majin Bone, Muttsuri Shinken, Zan) will launch a new manga for the Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!! anime series in the may issue of Saikyō Jump, which will release on April 4. Masahiro Hikokubo is credited for Duel composition for the manga.    Yu-Gi-Oh! Go Rush!!, the eighth main anime series in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise, will premiere on April 3. The anime is set in the birthplace of the popular card game Rush Duel, Mutsuba-cho. Twins Yūhi and Yuamu run UTS (Uchūjin Trouble Sōdansho or Alien Trouble Consulting), a group that (supposedly) gets rid of troublesome aliens from distant sectors of the galaxy via Rush Duel battles. However, one day, they find an actual spaceship, and inside they find Yudias, an alien from the Belgar Cluster. Yudias has come to Earth to search for Rush Duel to hopefully lead him and his friends (who have been chased out of their star system) into a new future. However, Yudias himself knows nothing about Rush Duel. Yūhi then challenges Yudias to a duel. The anime will feature an alien as a protagonist for the first time in the franchise.    Shueisha's V Jump magazine had revealed March 19 that the magazine will publish a new separate manga in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise starting in the June issue on April 21. The magazine stated the manga is related to the Official Card Game, which is abbreviated as ""OCG.""    The manga will serialize alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures manga. Masashi Sato launched the manga in June 2019. The series is also related to the franchise's Official Card Game.

However, Yudias himself knows nothing about Rush Duel. Yūhi then challenges Yudias to a duel. The anime will feature an alien as a protagonist for the first time in the franchise.    Shueisha's V Jump magazine had revealed March 19 that the magazine will publish a new separate manga in the Yu-Gi-Oh! franchise starting in the June issue on April 21. The magazine stated the manga is related to the Official Card Game, which is abbreviated as ""OCG.""    The manga will serialize alongside the Yu-Gi-Oh! OCG Structures manga. Masashi Sato launched the manga in June 2019. The series is also related to the franchise's Official Card Game.    Source: Weekly Shonen Jump issue 17 ",negative,en,{}

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

News E3 Game Show Cancels 2022 Event   posted on 2022-04-01 04:12 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         E3 returns in 2023    The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) revealed to IGN on Thursday that it has canceled this year's E3 event, and there will not be an in-person or digital component. The ESA revealed that E3 will return in 2023 with ""a reinvigorated showcase"" ""live from Los Angeles."" The ESA plans to ""focus its resources"" on the 2023 show.    The ESA had announced the cancellation of the in-person E3 event in January due to ""health risks surrounding"" the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). At the time, the trade association did not yet have plans for a digital/virtual event for E3.    IGN previously reported in January that it has confirmed from multiple sources ""tied to E3"" that the ESA had already made the decision to not hold an in-person event ""possibly as far back"" as fall 2021. The news site also confirmed with industry sources that companies had not heard about plans for any E3 event, whether physical or digital, even if such plans would have typically been revealed by that point in prior years. According to IGN, the Los Angeles Convention Center never put the E3 2022 show in its show calendar, despite shows in past years already being on the convention center's schedule over a year in advance.    The ESA held last year's E3 as a ""reimagined"" virtual event in June 2021, after canceling its in-person event in February earlier that year. The ESA canceled the physical E3 2020 event, and did not hold an online event that year.    The Los Angeles Convention Center also hosts Anime Expo, typically less than a month after E3. Anime Expo previously announced last year that it will return as a physical in-person event on July 1-4 this year, but it will require attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to attending the event.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

Titles with less than 4 votes are removed from the list but are still counted in the ranking. This explains why there may be gaps in the ""#"" column.

Titles with many votes will tend to be at the top, but this is modified a little by the ratings. In other words, the popularity is the straight average score of a title (the value in the rating column) multiplied by the number of votes.

Interest Utena, Penguindrum Director Ikuhara Announces Name Change   posted on 2022-03-31 01:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara.""    In an announcement that is characteristically cryptic, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara."" In Ikuhara's post on Twitter and Instagram, the announcement was framed with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    He updated his Twitter account to read ""Bonsoir Ikuhara, former name Kunihiko Ikuhara.""    ""Bonsoir"" is the French greeting for ""good evening."" Coincidentally, artist Bonjour Suzuki contributed the opening theme ""Ano Mori de Matteru"" for Ikuhara's anime series Yuri Kuma Arashi.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

Interest Utena, Penguindrum Director Ikuhara Announces Name Change   posted on 2022-03-31 01:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara.""    In an announcement that is characteristically cryptic, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara."" In Ikuhara's post on Twitter and Instagram, the announcement was framed with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    He updated his Twitter account to read ""Bonsoir Ikuhara, former name Kunihiko Ikuhara.""    ""Bonsoir"" is the French greeting for ""good evening."" Coincidentally, artist Bonjour Suzuki contributed the opening theme ""Ano Mori de Matteru"" for Ikuhara's anime series Yuri Kuma Arashi.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

Interest Utena, Penguindrum Director Ikuhara Announces Name Change   posted on 2022-03-31 01:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge          Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara.""    In an announcement that is characteristically cryptic, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara."" In Ikuhara's post on Twitter and Instagram, the announcement was framed with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    He updated his Twitter account to read ""Bonsoir Ikuhara, former name Kunihiko Ikuhara.""    ""Bonsoir"" is the French greeting for ""good evening."" Coincidentally, artist Bonjour Suzuki contributed the opening theme ""Ano Mori de Matteru"" for Ikuhara's anime series Yuri Kuma Arashi.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""    Ikuhara's Re:cycle of Penguindrum compilation films will open this year and the first is scheduled to debut in theaters on April 29. The second will open later this year. The film project will re-edit all 24 episodes of the television anime, but also add new sequences and new characters. Sumire Uesaka plays the new character Purin-Chu-Penguin.    Ikuhara announced at the 2020 New York Comic Con Metaverse panel for the Revolutionary Girl Utena series that he is ""working on [his] next work right now.""

In an announcement that is characteristically cryptic, Revolutionary Girl Utena and Penguindrum director Kunihiko Ikuhara stated his name is now ""Bonsoir Ikuhara."" In Ikuhara's post on Twitter and Instagram, the announcement was framed with language that is typically used for coming out, however Ikuhara didn't directly state that the name change is related to his gender identity. His posts highlighted that he chose to ""live honestly to myself"" and that the announcement may cause him to ""lose a lot of things."" The director made the revelation at midnight on March 31 in Japan, leading some fans to ask whether it was an early April Fool's joke.    He updated his Twitter account to read ""Bonsoir Ikuhara, former name Kunihiko Ikuhara.""    ""Bonsoir"" is the French greeting for ""good evening."" Coincidentally, artist Bonjour Suzuki contributed the opening theme ""Ano Mori de Matteru"" for Ikuhara's anime series Yuri Kuma Arashi.    Ikuhara has previously adopted pseudonyms in the past to represent his animation projects. For example, the original story for Sarazanmai is credited to ""Ikunirappa,"" the original story for Penguindrum is credited to ""Ikunichauda,"" and Yuri Kuma Arashi is attributed to ""Ikunigomamonaka.""

Interest The Two Upcoming Healer Anime Unite in April Fool's Visual   posted on 2022-04-01 10:00 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy          Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! & Healer Girl will premiere this April    The Spring 2022 anime season is just around the corner, and it's notable this year for debuting not one but two healer-themed anime: Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! and Healer Girl. This amusing coincidence has not been lost on the producers; the two anime teamed up on Friday for an April Fool's crossover visual.     ©Healer Girl Project   Lead voice actresses Aguri Ōnishi (Karla from Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!) and Carin Isobe (Kana Fujii from Healer Girl) participated in a joint interview commenting on the collaboration. The complimented each other's voice performances and remarked on how, despite both featuring healers, the two anime have a completely different tone: Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a comedy, while Healer Girl is soothing.    Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! will premiere on April 10. The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing.    Healer Girl will premiere on April 4. The story is set in a world where three schools of medicine are pervasive: Western medicine, Eastern medicine, and ""vocal medicine."" The healing of illness and injuries via songs is a special technique that not only improves the metal health of patients, but also the mental health of doctors. Such ""Healers"" strive to sing when called upon to respond to the health and anxiety of patients and doctors alike. The anime depicts the healer girls in training at the Karasuma Vocal Medical Institute.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          37 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 37 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          37 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 37 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better.

Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities.

News 'The Fruit of Evolution: Before I Knew It, My Life Had It Made' Novels Get New TV Anime   posted on 2022-04-01 11:35 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         'Evolved' title adds 'Shin' prefix    The official Twitter account for the anime of Miku and U35's Shinka no Mi ~Shiranai Uchi ni Kachigumi Jinsei~ (The Fruit of Evolution: Before I Knew It, My Life Had It Made) light novel series announced on Friday that a new television anime adaptation has been green-lit. The ""evolved"" new title is  Shin Shinka no Mi ~Shiranai Uchi ni Kachigumi Jinsei~ (True: The Fruit of Evolution: Before I Knew It, My Life Had It Made). The teaser visual below features the protagonist Seiichi Hiiragi and Saria, but also a mysterious character.       The anime's website features a countdown that will end on August 5. August 5 is also the first day of Crunchyroll Expo.    The ""animal fantasy"" story of The Evolution Fruit: Before I Knew it, My Life Had It Made! centers on Seiichi Hiiragi. Though at the bottom of his school's social pecking order, he and his entire school are upended when everyone in the school is transported into another world. Seiichi finds himself alone and approached by a gorilla, who instead of attacking him, proposes to him. At the moment that Seiichi thinks that ""I guess a gorilla is fine too,"" they find the Fruit of Evolution, and when they eat it, their lives are suddenly changed once again.    Miku began serializing the story on the ""Shōsetsuka ni Narō"" (Let's Become Novelists) website in January 2014, where it is still ongoing. Futabasha's Monster Bunko light novel label began publishing the novel in print in September 2014, with illustrations by U35 (Lapis Re:LiGHTs, Aquatrope of White Sand character designs).    Hanashi Media, a new U.S-based manga and light novel publisher, licensed the light novel series in English and Spansh.    Sorano launched a manga adaptation of the novels on Futabasha's Web Comic Action manga website in September 2017.    The novels inspired a previous television anime series that premiered on October 4 and had 12 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.

The teaser visual below features the protagonist Seiichi Hiiragi and Saria, but also a mysterious character.       The anime's website features a countdown that will end on August 5. August 5 is also the first day of Crunchyroll Expo.    The ""animal fantasy"" story of The Evolution Fruit: Before I Knew it, My Life Had It Made! centers on Seiichi Hiiragi. Though at the bottom of his school's social pecking order, he and his entire school are upended when everyone in the school is transported into another world. Seiichi finds himself alone and approached by a gorilla, who instead of attacking him, proposes to him. At the moment that Seiichi thinks that ""I guess a gorilla is fine too,"" they find the Fruit of Evolution, and when they eat it, their lives are suddenly changed once again.    Miku began serializing the story on the ""Shōsetsuka ni Narō"" (Let's Become Novelists) website in January 2014, where it is still ongoing. Futabasha's Monster Bunko light novel label began publishing the novel in print in September 2014, with illustrations by U35 (Lapis Re:LiGHTs, Aquatrope of White Sand character designs).
