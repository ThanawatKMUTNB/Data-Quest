This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!        discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               This Week in Anime homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

This Week in Anime Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing?  by Steve Jones & Monique Thomas, Mar 31st 2022           Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!

Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation.

At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch. But that's not really what happens?    Not that bad and horrible things don't happen to her but the explanation is uhh...messy....   To put it lightly, lol. So, the ""problem"" that Ranking runs into comes from a well-intentioned place that prioritizes empathy and forgiveness for its villains. Nothing wrong with that, that's a tried, true, and noble place to approach conflict from. Unfortunately, Miranjo does a lot of rancid stuff, so the narrative, presumably, believes it has to put a lot of extra work into making her sympathetic. And doubly unfortunately, the best answer Ranking comes up with is inventing an entire nation of evil cowards who live to be subjugated and possess literally no redeeming qualities.   That also happened to be heavily similar to the real-world historical Korea and Miranjo's people clearly are an analogue for Japanese people who can use magic. And then use that magic to ""help"" these poor backwards people who should clearly be grateful for their generosity! And then it's Oops! All Historical Revisionism!! King Bosse reveals the backstory of these two nations in his Mind Palace Theater, and it's generally hard to swallow how the story makes this comparison at face-value once you realize what it is. It's not presented with any subversive commentary and while Bosse has no reason to lie, he's also an asshole. He's also obviously biased due to his guilt from killing Miranjo's unnamed wizard father with his club.     It's a big gross mess that turns Ranking's entire thematic argument into a house of cards. Everyone in the world is complicated and capable of both good and evil—except for THESE assholes defined solely by their nationality in the most convenient colonialist terms possible. It sucks! It's so beneath the series' usual sensitivity that it boggles the mind to imagine such a huge blind spot.    And like, it already DID the whole ""purportedly evil clan that actually turns out to be misunderstood"" with Kage's people. The story clearly knows that prejudice always belies injustice. Which just makes the Gyakuza stuff all the more frustrating.   And worse, it makes you doubt the creator's intentions with depicting such a tale so callously once you realize the parallel. Such beliefs aren't uncommon in Japan among right-wingers and are used to discriminate against Korean diaspora. Depiction isn't necessarily belief but it should be done carefully. For those who want further reading can check Lynzee's episode reviews (Episode 18, specifically) and this article.   Honestly, it's an extremely small part of the show that'll likely fly over people's heads that are unaware of the history but turns out to be a MASSIVE bummer once you recognize it. It's also too complicated to linger on for the scope of  this TWIA for how separate it is without taking up the whole column, but it really shouldn't be ignored.    Even if we assume the best case scenario, it's still lazy writing that handwaves Miranjo's many mistakes away as a product of her suffering at the hands of actual monsters. She and the Gyakuza people both deserve richer characterization than that. And I mean, I do like the idea of Bosse and Miranjo developing this unhealthy codependence in response to their trauma, and I think it's good to explore how it spirals into such a disaster. Just wish the foundation wasn't built on the narrative equivalent of a peat bog.     You don't really need the parallel for that though, and having Miranjo come from a privileged group doesn't really make me sympathize with her more, and I didn't need it to sympathize with her. I could already tell she had a lot of problems from Daida's perspective inside The Sunken Place. But honestly, even if it wasn't there? I didn't really feel convinced by the rest of their backstory either, especially with the aforementioned vagueness around their relationship. And I'm a sucker for found families!     Honestly, the underworld bros ended up with a more compelling background for their current familial woes. Miranjo and Bosse make literal deals with a devil, but Desha, Despa, and Ouken each gamble away a piece of their soul in order to usurp the throne from their tyrannical dad, and it takes a toll on all three of them and their relationship.      And we get much less time dedicated to them. Which is a shame because most of the actual episode count is trying to figure out how to get around Ouken's terrifying power of immortality and loss of sanity/humanity. Honestly, the fights with Ouken feel the most drawn out, but I ultimately like the reasoning behind it and they're always well choreographed and an immortal fighter is the pure kryptonite to Bojji's pacifist technique.      I like that he keeps his dapper little mustache even when he becomes an unholy immortal stain on Creation.    But yeah, I also wish his goo didn't soak up so much of the second half's runtime. Like, the whole cour being just the siege on Bosse's castle is such a step down from the first cour's travelogue exploring the high and low extremities of the world. Tho I guess Bojji and Despa do visit the River Styx at one point, which counts for something.     I don't even mind all the groups running around, I loved seeing King Desha come in with all his glorious Waluigi-ness and try to assess the situation within the castle only to run into Domas' party of two who are trying to do the same. They confront each other only for Domas to get totally humiliated and kicked in the balls and also crying and also a lot of stupid things that maybe stimulates the morosexual part of my brain like when a man asks what the Spanish word for tortilla is.      Domas' penance for pushing Bojji into a bottomless pit is that he now gets owned at every possible opportunity, and I think that's only fair.     You gotta constantly dunk on men to cleanse the toxicities, until they become full Himbos. But even the show doesn't entirely let him off the hook. Bojji feels conflicted when he sees him and I really liked how the show doesn't push him to forgive someone who betrayed his trust even if he's truly very sorry and isn't going to do anything to hurt him anymore. Which is a lot more scrutiny than Miranjo gets tbh. Despite being a much smaller conflict, it's an important conflict for Bojji and really displays his growth and the support he gets from others.      All the Bojji-centric stuff remains top-notch, really. He takes a step back, just because there are so many other characters with so many other problems that need to be addressed, but Bojji still shines like the star he is, even when he has to tackle the toughest decisions head-on.    He also leads the best action scene in the whole dang season, fighting a literal and metaphorical battle against his giant dad with perspective tricks, fireworks, and foreshortening aplenty.        Man, Studio WIT is really good at animating tiny people fighting big people for some reason.   Episode 21 is basically a full episode of pure undiluted animation. One of the biggest displays of raw artistic talent of any show this season. And this was already on TOP of having one of the most beautiful and banger OPs that's somehow even more stand-out than the first one!      That's the impeccably talented Shingo Yamashita on OP2. If you enjoyed either of the Jujutsu Kaisen OPs, you'll easily recognize his style, but the additional softness he layers on to fit Ranking's tone elevates it to a whole 'nother level. I only have to think about certain cuts from that OP and I start welling up. It's that good.   The ED's no slouch either. And focuses on Kage's ever adorable support and loyalty to Bojji in a charming picture book style.     Oh yeah Kage is still incredible, of course. Love this little fried egg with all my heart. He might just be a support character, but this being a show about the importance of having support, he's an invaluable cast member.     He's such a good egg. He also got one over Ouken once and saved everyone. And even got to talk to his momma egg in the underworld.        And it's all that little stuff that makes it hard to dislike Ranking even when it flounders. Besides, production and pacing, it's a breeze to watch, especially week to week like I did. Watching an episode was never a bad time and it's only when I had to start scrutinizing some of the show's logic that some parts didn't hold up.   Yeah, for every ""Daida marries Miranjo,"" we get a heaping handful of lovable moments like Kage realizing the despair of having to live like a responsible adult, so the series' net goodness remains positive through the end.         Though it doesn't mean those parts aren't a bit of a blight either. Ranking went from a bonified S-tier show to maybe a B-tier, and at worse a C-tier show, and it flips based on whatever particular moment my brain chooses to focus on. There's still a lot of it that didn't really make a lot of sense or felt undeveloped for me, some of the cast members could've been utilized or explored more or simply didn't feel necessary. I could've gone for more Snake Dad Bebin but he and most of the Four Pillars, don't ever really end up having a whole lotta impact despite having a lot of set-up.    And a lot of other sections of the plot feel like they wrap too neatly to feel satisfying.   Like, seriously, I've never related to Hiling more. What the hell, man. Didn't we just do a whole arc about why rushing into a messy codependent relationship with a monarch wasn't exactly the best thing for Miranjo? And now you wanna put a ring on your magic mirror buddy right after she tried to turn your body into a Volvo for your dad? Forgiveness is good and all, but let's maybe pump the brakes.      Also, DAIDA IS YOUNGER THAN BOJJI!! MIRANJO IS LIKE AN ADULT?! I think, it's hard to tell with the art style and the unclear timeline of events. And also Daida maybe is similar to Bosse in many ways including his confused relationship with Miranjo where he sees her as a mentor and something to be protected? It's all sorts of hecked up. And everyone else besides Hiling who is an overprotective mom figure is just...cool with it? Even Bojji is just fine with it! Look, just because she suffered in the past doesn't mean she'll be held accountable, or that everyone hurt by her will be okay with it. See what I mean by earlier when Domas is held more responsible for a single attempted murder vs Miranjo's laundry list of suffering? Some of which is very personal!     It ain't great, and it's a testament to how much I like most of the rest of the anime that I can still count it among my favorites from this season. And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.      Also we got this one glimpse of Hilling holding her two beloved children right before that so maybe it's Good Actually.      Beaming with powerful mom energy.      I also maybe have a whole folder of Domas' stupid dumb face crying and/or blushing because some people on the animation staff keep trying to feed me (a mistake). I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.      See, that's me, only with pictures of Despa and his loyal steed.      I see no difference. I also really do love how it wraps things up for Bojji's character arc. You can see how much everyone comes to grow and respect him and his true strength of character.     Could he be a great king? He sure as heck could, and he proves it. Would he rather go on more adventures with his flat and prone-to-tears buddy? Yes, and he is correct to do so. Bojji is more than a king; he's a good friend.     That's a good place to leave the show on. I admit, I'm still invested in the wider world that I wouldn't be against coming back for more, but I'd also be more wary of the execution with how everything got handled. But on it's own, this much is satisfying. Let's all give three big cheers for our boy,   Bojji!!    Hip, Hip, Hooray!!      Have a good one, kid!      ",positive,en,{}
02-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2022-03-31/.184203,Does Ranking of Kings Nail the Landing? - This Week in Anime - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Wit Studio's sweeping fantasy series wrapped up this season. Did it live up to its expectations to be one of the best series of the year?    This series is streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation   Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed by the participants in this chatlog are not the views of Anime News Network.Spoiler Warning for discussion of the series ahead.     @Lossthief    @mouse_inhouse    @NickyEnchilada    @vestenet      Steve  Nicky, it only took an entire month's worth of free time, but I've finally finished Elden Ring! And as good as it was, I'm ready to move onto something different. No more stories about decrepit demigods, powerful giants, crumbling kingdoms, crafty mages, deals with the devil, undying guys in weird overly decorative armor, ri—    Ah, crap.   Nicky  I too, enjoy Kirby games.   That's a good point. Video games do indeed contain multitudes. But so does Ranking of Kings! Which not only just finished up, but also stars a protagonist at least as adorable as Kirby.    And potentially just as powerful! Bojji really is a contender for one of the Best Boys in anime. But is he strong enough to hold up the rest of the show?! We'll find out with the second half of Ranking of Kings!     Yeah, it's been a good while since we last checked in with the little guy. I don't think we had even gotten to see his tiny killer thumbtack in action. A lot has happened since then, and the second cour certainly did evolve into a much different beast than the first—perhaps necessarily so, but also not necessarily to its overall benefit.   The first half held a promise of adventure, political machinations, and fairytale-esque wonder. But after entering the underground for training with King Desha's brother, the cunning Despa, and then swiftly exiting to defend Bojji's home kingdom from the evil doings of the witch Miranjo controlling a group of freed dangerous criminals, I've found the second half to be mostly a straightforward series of battles interweaved with backstory for our antagonists.     It's tough! That first half is a really difficult act to follow, with each episode feeling like a new revelation that expanded our understanding of Bojji's world. The problem is that you eventually have to tie all those threads together into a coherent narrative with a middle and an end. That's an unenviable task I'm sympathetic to. But that sense of wonder is one of the second part's big casualties.   And there are plenty of other casualties because a lot of people sure do get stabbed.      The second half is both more straightforward plotwise but it's much less focused than the first as it's juggling a lot more pieces, motivations, and characters. There's a lot of battles and Studio WIT does a great job of delivering them. Lots of side characters get their own time to shine in the fighting ring. Even Queen Hiling gets a piece of the action with her super strong healing powers at play! As casual viewing, it's a fun watch and the animation mostly delivers with how many fights there are. Some look better and worse than others.     I love Hiling so much. Having a character around who can heal pretty much anyone back to full health would feel like a narrative cheat code if she didn't sell the sheer exertion of it so well. Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.      She's so on point, she's my second favorite character after Bojji even though she has a mean introduction. The show goes through a lot of lengths to show how she really just cares about being a good mom to her sons and that means you really don't want to see her get murdered. Ranking works best when it keeps things simple and Hiling is a good example of that. I also think her and bodyguard Dorshe are cute together, but so is the lady knight Ann. We also saw Hiling pushed to her limits here and as we see, she can't really do things like replace limbs, or eyeballs.   You're right, she does get to enjoy the best of both worlds when it comes to hot and strong vassals. It's good to be the queen.      This is bisexual culture. Also, both of them are WAAAY better than her husband Bosse who has taken over the body of their younger son, Daida through magic forbidden blood rituals involving a Corpse Slushie.     One of the things Ranking does very right is really dig into the fact that Bosse was not a great guy. Not evil, but not good king material either. And DEFINITELY not a great dad. Dude stole his one son's body and stole the other's strength before he was even born! I don't know anything about parenting, granted, but I don't find that very cool.   It's actually kind of hard to get why so many of the Four Pillars respect him other than his brute strength. In the first half he's shrouded in mystery and I can't say the second half really deepens his character. Like, I guess he killed some orcs at some point? I wanna know his tax policy.   I mean I guess he put out that fire once. That was nice. Still doesn't make up for all the son crimes though.   or daughter crimes, apparently, or war crimes, really a lot of crimes happening.   It's funny, too, that almost all of his issues can be boiled down to a single line of dialogue he exchanges with Bebin.     Ladies, if he describes you like this, DO run away and DO NOT trap your soul inside a magic mirror in a misguided gambit to spend eternity with him.   Miranjo was equally shrouded in mystery for the first half. Her motivation seemed to stem out of pure love for Bosse but of what nature it's hard to tell. They seemed to have a bit of a tragic romance vibes to them, but the show never really clarifies and then Bosse says that and it becomes very confused what the audience is supposed to think of them. Like yo, she killed Bojji's mom in front of him!! Before she gets attacked herself.     Oh yeah, that's probably the gnarliest scene in the entire season, and that's saying something considering about half of it revolves around fighting a guy who can reconstruct his entire body back from being pummeled into black goo. But mini-Bojji getting soaked in his mom's blood as she shields him with her body is ROUGH.    And she's not too happy about it either.     At first, I was trying to give Miranjo benefit of the doubt, as a witch, and one who lost her body, I really expected to be able to parallel her to Bojji's disability struggle and ostracization as a witch.

Nobody in the anime grimaces better than her.        Plus I adore the goofy bell-shaped armor she wears to hide her many pouches of mana-infused Ecto Cooler. Queen of slurping.    ,positive,en,{}

And, to be fair, it's not like Ranking's source material stops here, so maybe some of these concerns will be addressed eventually in the story. Like, it's funny that it takes almost the entire length of the show for the title to become relevant again, which is, admittedly, a pretty good hook should we ever get a sequel. Makes you think it might have a compelling master plan after all.    ",positive,en,{}

I am a woman of simple needs and 2/3rds of them can be covered by looking at some drawings of really attractive anime characters.    ,negative,en,{}

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

Have to admit, seeing all the seasons and Ash/Satoshi's Pokemon together really hit me in the feels.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

The phenomenon that first started with Red and Green then continued the next year with the start of Satoshi's adventure with Pikachu, Kasumi, and Takeshi in the original PM anime to the greatness of XY (until they ruined it by making Satoshi.... then made the decision to do it in the next series) with Satoshi Gekkouga and having the Mega Evolution specials with Alan and Lizardon that had the best battles.

Have to admit, seeing all the seasons and Ash/Satoshi's Pokemon together really hit me in the feels.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

When they announced Pokemon 2020 as being what it is, I assumed Ash and Goh would me our main characters for multiple generations but now that a new generation is on the horizon and The show seems to be treating everything as though it's in its final stages, I don't know...   Like at this rate Ash is gonna wind up being the best battle trainer in the world via ranking and like... where do we even take him from there? Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic. For some reason I can't help but look back and see all of the little ways the show has changed itself from then to now and find it all really interesting.

Lots of people have assumed this would be his last season as the main character and as much as usual framing would make me believe that I'm skeptical because he still has Pikachu, the franchise mascot, and how asinine would it be to just have a new character only to cram a pikachu in the cast somewhere? Much as a 25 year run with the kid and his mons would be a good place to cap things off with him but the anime has always had this weird way of just doing what it wants and chugging along just fine regardless so uh *shrug*   Goh seemed so flexible to me as a character that I could have easily seen him being around for a while or even serving as Ash's replacement as the main character, where Goh would then find some other kid who'd get into battling and the baton would be handed off to them, etc. That doesn't seem to be the case but again, I have no clue. While Chole/Koharu was never promised to us that'd she be like the 3rd lead or anything it does feel pretty criminal that we don't get to have her around as often, as I really like Her and Goh as characters for Ash to travel and bounce off of, kids with a bit more cynicism in em than the usual perfect goodie two shoes (I say this while loving the cast from sun and moon lol)    Over these 25 years of the anime's run I've gone from being a childhood fan, to forgetting about it, to re-involving myself with it, to joining in on the internet hate bandwagon under the guise of ""being critical"", to getting tired of the pointless easy target picking, to now just appreciating and enjoying it for what it is. I feel like I've gone the whole gambit of ways you can feel anything towards this show and all I really have to say now is that I'll always be curious to see what they decide to do next, because right when I thought they found their winning formula with XY and that they would just do repeat variations of that ad nauseum, they really switched things up and made one of (if not the depending on my mood) my favorite installments of the show and have really been playing around a bit with what they can do with the show, while keeping it simple and episodic.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.       Review:         Synopsis:          Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans.

The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.      Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B- Art : A-  + Quintessential Dragon Quest comfort food, fun and light − Being aimed at a younger audience means that it can be predictable            discuss this in the forum (11 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Riku Sanjō   Art: Kōji Inada   Full encyclopedia details aboutDragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.       Review:         Synopsis:          Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai.

One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans.

The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.      Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.             Grade:      Overall : B+ Story : B- Art : A-  + Quintessential Dragon Quest comfort food, fun and light − Being aimed at a younger audience means that it can be predictable            discuss this in the forum (11 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story: Riku Sanjō   Art: Kōji Inada   Full encyclopedia details aboutDragon Quest: Dai no Daibōken (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans.

The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.      Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Review   by Grant Jones, Mar 29th 2022       Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Voiume 1                     Synopsis:               Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai tells the tale of the young warrior Dai. Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii. The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.

The English translation is by Gregory Werner, the lettering is by Steve Dutro, and editing is by Jennifer Sherman. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is published by Viz Books.      Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.    Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai Volume 1 is written by Riku Sanjo, illustrated by Koji Inada, and supervised by Yuji Horii.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training. This limits the scope but allows us to spend more time with him and Gomechan, developing a strong bond that can serve as an anchor to the narrative. If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

If you've watched the anime you know that Dai will eventually travel, but its always a good call for a long-running manga to establish an early investment in its characters.    If there are any negatives to be had, they mostly come by association. As I mentioned before, if you're not in the mood for more Dragon Quest… well, this won't convince you otherwise – this is for true believers who want to see slimes get hit by Kasizzle. There's also a bit of a… soft touch to everything. The Adventure of Dai is very much in the classic shonen mold, a soft bubbly tale for a younger audience that is neither too complicated nor thought-provoking. This is intentional, and I personally don't think it is a negative, but if you are used to the slight edge that modern shonen works have you might be disappointed to find something aimed at *gasp* children.    All in all, Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai's first volume is a solid start to a solid series that gives you exactly what it says on the tin: Dragon Quest and some Adventures therein.

Dai is raised by monsters on an island and he is friends with a flying golden slime named Gomeachan. One day, this peaceful island is visited by a Hero and his companions – and they have nefarious plans. Soon Dai is being trained by the Hero Avan and befriends the magician Popp while being caught up in the broader struggle against the Demon King Hadlar.

Review:            Your enjoyment of Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai will depend quite heavily on how you feel about the iconic Dragon Quest JRPGs. Do you think fondly of the franchise as a series of fairy-tale-esque adventures that provide a sense of comfort and familiarity through its whimsical and well-worn conventions? Or does the mere mention of its name invoke repetition and endless grind against a trope-laden backdrop that you have plowed through a dozen times before?    I say this because Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai is a Dragon Quest manga through and through. It might sound ridiculous because… well, it's right there in the title, but it bears mentioning nonetheless. A video game franchise with a highly-respected legacy that has achieved an almost household-name status in Japan (and growing international fame), it's hard to find someone with zero opinion on the Dragon Quest franchise these days, and Dai actively courts this association with every fiber of its being. So in some sense this is a simple review: would you like more Dragon Quest? If so, proceed onward young adventurer. If not, then begone for here be dragons (and their quests).    It's important to note that this volume is a legacy release. Dragon Quest: The Adventure of Dai originally ran in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1989 to 1996. It has been adapted twice now in anime form, first by Toei Animation from 1991 to 1992 and again from 2020 to the present – the latter having an official simulcast and likely the iteration most international fans know it by. When the anime dropped in 2020 I had hoped this would mean a release of the original manga in English, and by the goddess we have been blessed accordingly.    I am legally and morally obligated to discuss Akira Toriyama when talking about Dragon Quest. Obviously, the character and monster designs of the video games all come from the esteemed mangaka, and the impact of his delightful work on the tone and popularity of the series is incalculable. It is not a stretch to say that when Akira Toriyama designed the humble slime all those years ago he distilled the very essence of Dragon Quest's character design to its purest form: to make a little guy, and to make him Very Good™. Dragon Quest: The Adventures of Dai may not be illustrated by Akira Toriyama, but Kōji Inada manages to reproduce his style quite flawlessly, from the buoyant rounded characters to even Toriyama's sense of comedic timing. Of course, it would be heresy to render a  Dragon Quest story in anything too far removed from Toriyama's sensibilities, but the art in this volume is nevertheless lovingly crafted and carefully done so as to maximize familiarity.    The writing is also quite familiar. Dragon Quest has evil monster kings, so The Adventure of Dai has one; Dragon Quest has Heroes, so the very idea of Hero is turned into an institution with the requisite ambitions and training arcs. Even the story beats and imagery are somewhat similar to Toriyama's other work in Dragon Ball – it's hard to see Dai training with a blade in the wilderness among monsters and not think of Gohan's time as a youngster doing much the same. The fact that these two stories ran nearly parallel in their publication makes them seem like echoes of one another, though of course the eventual outcomes make those similarities fade with time.    That's not to say there is nothing new here; in fact, there are plenty of subtle but meaningful changes that The Adventure of Dai introduces to spice up the formula. Simple things like having the first Hero and party we meet end up as conniving ne'er do wells is a nice touch. Furthermore, Dai's status as a young boy raised by monsters lends him more of an outsider persona as opposed to many of Dragon Quest's protagonists, most of whom are simply young blank slates for the player to project onto (to varying degrees of course). The development of side characters like Avan and Popp shows plenty of promise, and Dai's crest hints at future mysteries to be unraveled. Add in the potential rogues gallery of Hadlar's various generals, and there's plenty of future fun to be had.    This volume is also much smaller in scope than you might expect. Dragon Quest is a series that – among other things – has garnered a reputation for its breadth. Visiting different locales, each with their own tiny tales, and resolving local problems before moving on to the next place has become one of the franchise's defining features (again, to varying degrees across titles). However, The Adventure of Dai spends nearly the entirety of its first volume on the monster island, focusing on Dai's training.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Love All Play   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.     discuss this in the forum (36 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,{}

Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind.

Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should. Put together you have a character drama where none of the dialogue feels right, and the result is oddly alienating for such a mundane show. Even if these characters weren't already dull as dirt, that would kill basically any dramatic potential all on its own.    As always, my benchmark for a sports show is if I'd rather watch another episode, or just watch the real-life sport it's showcasing for the same amount of time. I'm by no means a badminton expert, but I would most certainly rather watch a match than sit through another episode of Love All Play going through the motions.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Some first episodes throw you right into the action. This is not one of them. That's not inherently a bad thing, though – Love All Play opts to start by establishing its protagonist and his situation, and since that stands to be a major factor in how he fits in (or doesn't) with the badminton team he's going to be a part of in high school, it feels like the right approach. Ryo only started playing the sport in middle school, and that's only because his best friend got suckered by the cute girls' team, so it really does feel like a shock that he gets scouted by an elite high school for a sports recommendation. If he accepts, he'll get to bypass the entrance exam, which as all seasoned anime viewers know is a lot of stress taken off of his plate.    What I like about this episode is that the recommendation doesn't immediately solve all of Ryo's problems. If anything, it creates more of them, because not only is he at risk of alienating his friends who didn't get offers, but his parents, rather than being happy for him, angrily tell him that he's not accepting the recommendation. This feels like the most surprising element of the episode, and even if his dad has decent reasons for his veto (Mom just seems to be going along with Dad, and that almost makes me angrier), he's still actively crushing his son's good news. It's older sister Rika who wins the family MVP award as the only person who's thinking about what Ryo might want and being supportive of his choices.    That feels like foreshadowing, because Ryo's first meeting with his new high school team (as a special invitation for five lucky middle schoolers before they enroll) looks like it could be rocky. There aren't really any surprises with the teammates in terms of character; Ryo's idol, Kenta, looks to be a raging asshole, there's a Kageyama lookalike, bouncy twins, and a kindly team captain to round the whole thing out. The badminton angle is at least a slightly less common sport to use (although last season had Ryman's Club, so it's apparently gaining popularity), but otherwise this episode looks to be setting up a regular old sports show. That said, the very introductory nature of the episode means that this is going to require another episode or two to determine how much you'll enjoy it, because this is very much a bare-bones setup. But it looks pretty good (even if it has a fixation on close-ups of faces) and Ryo feels like a character it won't be hard to get behind. Simply put, there's nothing overtly wrong with this episode even if there's nothing overtly right either, and if you're hankering for some boys playing sports in shorts, this very well might fit the bill.

02-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/love-all-play/.183508,Love All Play - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Love All Play ?                     Community score: 1.9              What is this?   Ryō Mizushima joined his middle school's badminton team full of motivation — but without a proper coach, ended up in obscurity. Nevertheless, he did eventually reach the prefectural tournament on his physical strength. Now he joins the prestigious Yokohama-Minato High School's badminton team under the legendary coach Ebihara and surrounded by talented teammates. He strives to become a top athlete and take his high school team to the inter-high tournament.    Love All Play is based on Asami Koseki's badminton novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                By the looks of its premiere, Love All Play is a decent looking series that showcases a team of likeable boys playing badminton. I was not aware that badminton was such a well established sports institution that it would demand multiple anime adaptation, but between this, Hanebad!, and that Salaryman's Club show from just earlier this year, I guess fans around the world must be simmering with shuttlecock fever? That's all well and good, so far as I'm concerned, because I figure every sport deserves its day in the anime adaptation spotlight, no matter how niche they might seem to an inside boy like me.    My main issue with Love All Play is that, outside of depicting a unique sport that I'm sure will be interesting to longtime players or interested newcomers, the show doesn't have much else to offer for folks in the audience that want a good story to go along with all of the rackets and volleys. Our main character, Ryo, is defined by his meekness and general lack of ambition, and this whole first episode is focused on the “drama” of him trying to decide whether or not to join the premiere badminton team at the ritzy Yokohama Minato High School. There's some minor, barely addressed conflict concerning Ryo leaving his original badminton buddy behind, but it doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the rest of the dramatics feel forced.    When Ryo's father becomes almost comically angry at the prospect of his son attending a prestigious high school on the strength of his athletic skills, my first thought was “Geez, did a shuttlecock kill his parents in a dark alley, or something?” I wasn't that far off—the guy apparently lost out on a track scholarship because of an injury—but it's never a good sign when your jokey head-canon ends up being more compelling than what's happening on screen. I kind of liked how Ryo's sister stood up to their parents, since I'm always down for wholesome sibling dynamics, but it also serves to emphasize how much of a wet blanket Ryo is.    I get how that's the point of his character arc, but still, while there's nothing about Ryo's introduction here that is awful, it's nevertheless quite boring, to me. I was especially irritated by the chintzy soundtrack, which kept insisting that Ryo was going through some real intense drama, but c'mon. It's a badminton anime. We all know he's going to play badminton. Let's get on with it. If any of you Sports Boy Anime fans keep up with this one, let me know if it develops any of that missing spark in the coming weeks. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to [insert clever badminton related pun here].        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's something...off about this premiere, though not in a particularly intriguing way. Have you ever sat down to type something on your computer, not paying a lot of attention, then suddenly realize your fingers were just off the home row keys, and you've been typing gibberish in the shape of regular words? That's the feeling I got watching this premiere. It wears the form and performs the expected movements of an average high-school sports show, but somewhere in its construction things didn't mesh properly, and the result is an uncomfortably stiff and empty start to what looks to be a perfectly middling badminton show.    Part of the problem is that across this whole premiere, there's maybe a combined 45 seconds of badminton action if you don't count the opening animation. That's just not going to cut it if you want to get the audience invested in your particular sport, and what we get instead is a flat and inert little drama about our nondescript main boy wavering over taking a sports recommendation to a big fancy school. And the scant few moments of sports action we do get are just...not right. For all its flaws, last season's Salaryman's Club was able to capture the impact, speed, and high-octane energy of high-level badminton matches. Here, things are stiff and slow by comparison, and it makes its a lot harder to buy into how our wet noodle protagonist just loves badminton so, so much.    Though those sequences are likely a product of an overall struggling production. Even with the lack of any big set pieces, the rest of this episode struggles with pretty much any movement, up to and including characters talking. There's a stiffness to everyone's body language and faces that prevents them from ever feeling expressive, and a strangely slow pace to the editing that makes any conversation feel more disjointed than it should.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.    Raffael Coronelli is an out-of-practice First Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo, author of How to Have an Adventure in Northern Japan, Daikaiju Yuki, and other books, and has contributed essays to blu-ray releases from Arrow Video.

02-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-03-30/the-martial-arts-of-kengan-ashura/.181664,The Martial Arts of Kengan Ashura - Anime News Network:SEA,"      The Martial Arts of Kengan Ashura   by Raffael Coronelli, Mar 30th 2022          Some say 3D anime action isn't dynamic. Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!     Hailing from England, Mokichi Robinson uses Bartitsu, an archaic British martial art. Yes, there was a martial art developed in England in the Victorian era, though it's fallen into obscurity and is now most widely remembered via a misspelled reference to “Baritsu” in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes novels. Its real-life inventor was an Englishman named Edward W. Barton-Wright who visited Meiji-era Japan as it newly opened to the West and became enamored with Japanese martial arts. Barton-Wright modestly named Bartitsu after himself, combining his last name with “jiu-jitsu”. It was a mixed martial art incorporating the aforementioned Japanese style, western boxing, French Savate, and others. Robinson's use of it is a deep cut, showing the type of research that went into his creation.     Returning to Japan, we find one of the series' darkest characters, former police officer Akoya Seishu. Akoya uses taiho-jutsu, literally “the art of arresting,” a restraining-focused martial art taught to Japanese police officers. While the use of taiho-jutsu is intended to be a non-lethal subduing alternative, Akoya's personal extremism lead him to warp it into a deadly execution technique. Police brutality is a loaded subject, and Kengan Ashura barrels headlong into it via one of its most horrific characters. Is there a thinly-veiled subtext? Is it pure exploitation? Whatever the case, Akoya stands as one of the more thought-provoking characters in the series.     On a lighter note, the “fighting style” of professional wrestling as used by charismatic fan favorite Sekibayashi Jun is (sorry to burst everyone's bubble) not real. WWE-style wrestling is described by that organization itself as “sports entertainment,” a scripted form of theater that uses the illusion of fighting to tell a story. In the world of Kengan Ashura, Sekibayashi is able to successfully hold his own against world-class fighters using methods that would not work in reality, which shows Sandrovich's true attitude toward all of this. Fighting technique is important, but what's more important is the entertainment for the audience. Kengan Ashura is a world where you can suspend your disbelief that a pro wrestler is really fighting and really winning against people trained in deadly martial art styles. It's a fantasy that incorporates just enough reality to be dynamic and interesting, but is heightened and purposely ridiculous in a way that watching an MMA match can't give you. Yes, there are unrealistic things in Kengan Ashura, and a martial arts aficionado like Sandrovich knows that. He's put them in there because a character like Sekibayashi is fun—and by extension, so is this wild and entertaining series.     At the time of this writing, a long-awaited third season of the anime has been announced to finish adapting the manga's original run. It's been a few years' hiatus, but martial arts are timeless — and the manga is well worth reading in the mean time. However over-the-top and insane its narrative and aesthetics become, Kengan Ashura was born and thrives on a reverence for the world's fighting styles in any form, a respectful celebration of martial arts and their appeal as much as a fantastic exaggeration of their entertainment value.

Then there's Kengan Ashura. There's a reason this series has gained such a dedicated following for its brutal and kinetic fights — the manga it faithfully adapts was written by Yabako Sandrovich, a real-deal martial artist. Like the late, great Sonny Chiba performing karate in a 70s Toei action movie, Sandrovich and his illustrator Daromeon meticulously constructed Kengan Ashura's fights in the original manga, drawing from experience and study in the field of martial arts from around the globe.     Martial arts have been a major element of plenty of anime over the years, and have left a lasting imprint on the medium. Fist of the North Star famously drew from Chinese kung-fu to create one of the foundational series of 80s anime, filled with over-the-top violence and musclebound experts in martial technique. Those same descriptors can easily be applied to Kengan Ashura, the smash hit manga written by Sandrovich and drawn by Daromeon, later adapted into a popular Netflix-distributed anime series by director Seiji Kishi and Larx Entertainment that stays remarkably close to the original material.     Yabako Sandrovich is an interesting guy. One of his former stints before writing manga, which also includes the slice-of-life sensation How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?, was as a ruins excavator. More relevant to Kengan Ashura, he also has at least fourteen years of martial arts experience.    In the world of Kengan, international companies conduct business by employing fighters to enter a secret tournament of the world's deadliest fighting styles. Not only is the selection of martial arts from around the globe on display a veritable buffet for fight technique connoisseurs, it comes from a background of understanding what makes them work. Let's dive into some of the series' main combatants and take a look at the way they fight.     The basis for the mixed martial art fighting style practiced by the main protagonist Tokita Ohma is a combination of two of the most popular and widespread Japanese martial arts — karate and jiu-jitsu. Developed by the Ryukyu kingdom in Okinawa, karate is known for its sudden, explosive strikes that release pent-up force in the form of powerful punches and kicks. Jiu-jitsu originates from the Honshu mainland, and focuses more on using the opponent's momentum against them, redirecting their attacks and movements. The exact style Ohma uses that fuses these practices is the fictional “Niko Style” of Sandrovich's own invention, named after the famous town in Tochigi prefecture. The Niko Style applies secret techniques to the standard karate-based punching and axe-kicking that Ohma regularly performs to unleash a variety of superhuman abilities, and in the spirit of jiu-jitsu, to turn the enemy's own attacks back at them. Not only are the types of moves from these two Japanese martial arts depicted properly, but their core ethos are both intact in this new fantasy-tinged mashup. Like Fist of the North Star before it, Kengan Ashura has taken real martial arts and added a layer of prowess that only a manga character could possess.     Various styles of karate and jiu-jitsu form the basis of several other major characters' chosen disciplines, but let's head south to take a look at a fighter from Thailand, the home of another world-famous fighting style — Muay Thai. Kaolan Wongsawat is known as the “Thai God of War” in the world of Kengan. His moves incorporate the straightforward punches of western boxing, but are mainly based on Thailand's native martial art that dates back to before the 16th century. Using a combination of kneeing, jabbing opponents with elbows, and delivering slamming kicks with one's shins, this close-quarters style has become a favorite of MMA fighters and was popularized in world cinema by the blindingly fast athletics of actor Tony Jaa. Kaolan's superhuman prowess with Muay Thai and super-fast “flicker” jabs make him a dangerous man for any of the tournament's entrants to get near.     Staying in Southeast Asia, let's look at the martial art practiced by boisterous character Saw Paing from Myanmar. Lethwei is a brutal type of bare-knuckle boxing originating thousands of years ago in ancient Myanmar's Pyu Empire, used both for sport and warfare, and still practiced to this day. According to Sandrovich's author's notes in the back of a manga issue featuring Saw Paing, he'd heard through martial arts circles that lethwei fighters from Myanmar were especially strong, inspiring him to create the character. Saw Paing's exuberant personality balances out the annihilating techniques he uses, making him a likable fan favorite.    Crossing the Pacific, we arrive in Brazil, a country home to a sizable population of Japanese immigrants. This cultural exchange resulted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the basis for the style used by Kengan character Imai Cosmo. Cosmo's reputation as the ‘king of stranglers’ comes from a grappling-focused aspect of the Brazilian style' The difference from the original Japanese jiu-jitsu is that the Brazilian style focuses more on grappling with your opponent once you've gotten them into your desired position, putting them in a chokehold or lock. It's this method that allows Cosmo, a smaller fighter, to overpower larger adversaries.     Endearing and earnest American street fighter Adam “The Emperor” Dudley uses a type of blunt attack-oriented mixed martial arts, relying more on sheer force than a specific discipline. Hilariously, he fights on behalf of the “Boss Burger” corporation, whose CEO is a literal clown named Ronald. Very American!
