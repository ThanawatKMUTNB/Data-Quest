Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2. Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Nishikata learns that there certainly wasn't an oddly specific and direct love confession for Takagi to read in the text of the book, and if that was Takagi trying to stealthily communicate her true feelings for Nishikata, then maybe the dozens of other times she's pulled similar stunts have also been…. (Dear readers, let me tell you that watching the truth of it all slowly dawn on our precious idiot's face has been one of the anime highlights of the past who-knows-how-long for me. I can only thank the Anime Gods that text reviews are incapable of transmitting the embarrassing noises I was making for half of this episode).  Also, can we talk for a moment about how incredible of a boyfriend Nishikata is going to be once he realizes that he's already been dating Takagi for, like, two years now? Nishikata may have been able to fool himself into thinking that “Nishikata Quest” was nothing more than an attempt to finally one-up his lifelong rival, but you and I (and the Girl Squad!) all know that his insanely elaborate scavenger hunt is one of the most romantic gestures imaginable, and if I had just one completely petty complaint to make about “March 14th”, it is that we have to settle for watching Mina and Co. solve all of the puzzles instead of Takagi herself. Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time. Could I maybe nitpick a little about how some of the running animation looks a little off, or how the general timing of the scene feels just a little bit stretched out? Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art. I am not a monster, though, so instead I will simply revel in the simple joy that comes from watching two sweet kids get one step closer to expressing how much they love each other. Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.  That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.

Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 Episode 12  by James Beckett, Mar 31st 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of Teasing Master Takagi-san (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his. It's just pure, platonic friendship that is fueling Nishikata's urge to spend inordinate amounts of time arranging elaborate scavenger hunts for the girl he spends nearly every minute of his free time with…right? Sure, he does like hanging out with Takagi, and he can admit that she's pretty cute…and his heart starts to sink when he realizes she's not around to play the usual games with him in class…and he was so excited to see her face when she discovered the game-to-end-all-games that he made just for her… That alone would have been enough to dial my heart's Melt-o-Meter™ to dangerously high levels, but then the show actually goes out of its way to bring back the sneaky love confession that Takagi gave with that book she was teasing Nishikata with all the way back in Episode 2.

Yes, I am fully aware that the sight of Takagi falling in love with Nishikata all over again as she played Nishikata Quest would likely have fully killed me, or at the very least sent me into a shock-induced coma, but dammit, that's a risk I'm willing to take! I need this, Takagi-san! Ah well. I suppose I'll just have to settle for the utterly delightful ending scene that sees Nishikata racing after Takagi's car to make sure he can get her the traditional White Day gift on time.

Sure, I could…if I was a monster that hated love and art.

Sure, Nishikata might not say “I love you” in this finale, but he doesn't need to. All Takagi needs to hear is that the boy of her dreams wanted nothing more than to see her, and to give her a small token of appreciation, because she really does mean the world to him.

Community score: 4.8             Wow. Given how absolutely wonderful this third season of Teasing Master Takagi-san has been, I was trying to keep my expectations as low-key as possible going into this finale. There's a shiny new theatrical release on its way, after all, so I figured that the show would save its biggest romantic revelations for the big screen. Now, it's true that we don't technically get a confession this week, so that Takagi-san movie still has some ammo left in its pocket to work with, but that doesn't prevent “March 14th” from being one of the most sweet and satisfying finales that I've ever seen in a romance anime. Even if we didn't have a movie to look forward to, and this final episode of Season 3 was the last we were ever going to see of Nishikata and Takagi, I would have walked away from Teasing Master Takagi-san feeling completely satisfied. To steal a phrase from New Girl's Schmidt: “No notes!” First of all, it is impossible to understate how gosh darned adorable it is to see Nishikata slowly-but-surely piece together his own feelings for Takagi after Hamaguchi tries to pressure him into confessing to Takagi. At first, of course, Nishikata feels like there is no way that he feels anything other than a friendly (but fierce) rivalry towards the girl who teases him so much, and his elaborately designed “Nishikata Quest” is going to be the ultimate test of Takagi's mental fortitude against his.

That's more than enough for me. Whatever comes next for Teasing Master Takagi-san is just icing on the cake. What we've got here, already, is maybe about as close to a perfect anime love story is you can get. Rating:                 Teasing Master Takagi-san Season 3 is currently streaming on HIDIVE.   James is a writer with many thoughts and feelings about anime and other pop-culture, which can also be found on Twitter, his blog, and  his podcast.   <prevEpisodes 1-3 Episode 4 Episode 5 Episode 6 Episode 7 Episode 8 Episode 9 Episode 10 Episode 11 Episode 12  ",positive,en,{}

Love of Kill Episode 11  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is the episode where we finally begin to start getting our questions answered after weeks of buildup and I have to say…it's honestly a little underwhelming so far. Granted we only get what feels like the first half of a longer flashback, so there's a good chance any questions that I have after finishing this episode could be answered next week. Plus there was some nice subtle stuff that helped reframe earlier parts of the series which is honestly the bare minimum that I wanted this flashback to do. I like the implication that Ryang-ha was never really romantically interested in Château at the beginning of the series and that he was just looking to confirm whether she was the same little girl that he saw all those years ago. I also like how Ryang-ha already displayed really good intuition and survival instinct even at a young age. It's not too far of a leap to imagine that he would be a skilled hitman as he got older and I really do like how the episode ends by extensively mirroring Château as a child with her in present day as I can only assume she finally broke her mental block of those memories.   That being said, I guess my biggest complaint is that so far, these revelations don't feel like an adequate enough payoff to 10 episodes of buildup. The show is basically trying to tell two stories at the same time. The first is the present-day story with all these rivaling hitman organizations going after each other with Ryang-ha and Château in the middle. The other story is that of a little girl who ends up being transported by two young men that are slowly sinking deeper into the dark underbelly of the world. I can see where these two stories would line up but my problem is that they don't mesh together as cleanly as I think the show wanted them to. We got little hints about what happened in the past throughout the show and while it was intriguing, they made it so I could already infer a lot of the stuff we saw in this episode…so there aren't a lot of major new revelations here. Secondly, aside from Donny having an interest in getting Château, which I can only imagine is because that was a job that technically failed, there isn't really a lot in the present day that we could look forward to plot-wise. Remember the first half of the show was just Ryang-ha harassing Château and bringing danger towards her under the guise of protecting her. We have one final episode left and I'm starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won't be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.

Love of Kill Episode 11  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is the episode where we finally begin to start getting our questions answered after weeks of buildup and I have to say…it's honestly a little underwhelming so far. Granted we only get what feels like the first half of a longer flashback, so there's a good chance any questions that I have after finishing this episode could be answered next week. Plus there was some nice subtle stuff that helped reframe earlier parts of the series which is honestly the bare minimum that I wanted this flashback to do. I like the implication that Ryang-ha was never really romantically interested in Château at the beginning of the series and that he was just looking to confirm whether she was the same little girl that he saw all those years ago. I also like how Ryang-ha already displayed really good intuition and survival instinct even at a young age. It's not too far of a leap to imagine that he would be a skilled hitman as he got older and I really do like how the episode ends by extensively mirroring Château as a child with her in present day as I can only assume she finally broke her mental block of those memories.   That being said, I guess my biggest complaint is that so far, these revelations don't feel like an adequate enough payoff to 10 episodes of buildup. The show is basically trying to tell two stories at the same time. The first is the present-day story with all these rivaling hitman organizations going after each other with Ryang-ha and Château in the middle. The other story is that of a little girl who ends up being transported by two young men that are slowly sinking deeper into the dark underbelly of the world. I can see where these two stories would line up but my problem is that they don't mesh together as cleanly as I think the show wanted them to. We got little hints about what happened in the past throughout the show and while it was intriguing, they made it so I could already infer a lot of the stuff we saw in this episode…so there aren't a lot of major new revelations here. Secondly, aside from Donny having an interest in getting Château, which I can only imagine is because that was a job that technically failed, there isn't really a lot in the present day that we could look forward to plot-wise. Remember the first half of the show was just Ryang-ha harassing Château and bringing danger towards her under the guise of protecting her. We have one final episode left and I'm starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won't be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.

Love of Kill Episode 11  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 11 of Love of Kill ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is the episode where we finally begin to start getting our questions answered after weeks of buildup and I have to say…it's honestly a little underwhelming so far. Granted we only get what feels like the first half of a longer flashback, so there's a good chance any questions that I have after finishing this episode could be answered next week. Plus there was some nice subtle stuff that helped reframe earlier parts of the series which is honestly the bare minimum that I wanted this flashback to do. I like the implication that Ryang-ha was never really romantically interested in Château at the beginning of the series and that he was just looking to confirm whether she was the same little girl that he saw all those years ago. I also like how Ryang-ha already displayed really good intuition and survival instinct even at a young age. It's not too far of a leap to imagine that he would be a skilled hitman as he got older and I really do like how the episode ends by extensively mirroring Château as a child with her in present day as I can only assume she finally broke her mental block of those memories.   That being said, I guess my biggest complaint is that so far, these revelations don't feel like an adequate enough payoff to 10 episodes of buildup. The show is basically trying to tell two stories at the same time. The first is the present-day story with all these rivaling hitman organizations going after each other with Ryang-ha and Château in the middle. The other story is that of a little girl who ends up being transported by two young men that are slowly sinking deeper into the dark underbelly of the world. I can see where these two stories would line up but my problem is that they don't mesh together as cleanly as I think the show wanted them to. We got little hints about what happened in the past throughout the show and while it was intriguing, they made it so I could already infer a lot of the stuff we saw in this episode…so there aren't a lot of major new revelations here. Secondly, aside from Donny having an interest in getting Château, which I can only imagine is because that was a job that technically failed, there isn't really a lot in the present day that we could look forward to plot-wise. Remember the first half of the show was just Ryang-ha harassing Château and bringing danger towards her under the guise of protecting her. We have one final episode left and I'm starting to have trepidation that the conclusion won't be as satisfactory as I think I wanted it to but at least it might end up satiating my curiosity.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Previews New Footage   posted on 2022-03-31 18:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Film takes us back to night of October 4, followed by epilogue after TV anime's story    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip shows Odokawa and Shirakawa  talking in a park after ""that incident,"" with Odokawa warning Shirakawa about getting involved with dangerous yakuza-type individuals.         The film will premiere in Japan on Friday, April 1. The television anime's main cast and staff are returning, and ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Previews New Footage   posted on 2022-03-31 18:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Film takes us back to night of October 4, followed by epilogue after TV anime's story    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip shows Odokawa and Shirakawa  talking in a park after ""that incident,"" with Odokawa warning Shirakawa about getting involved with dangerous yakuza-type individuals.         The film will premiere in Japan on Friday, April 1. The television anime's main cast and staff are returning, and ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""    Takeichi Abaraya and Konomoto launched a manga adaptation of the anime in January 2021 on Shogakukan's digital manga label Superior Dalpana.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Previews New Footage   posted on 2022-03-31 18:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Film takes us back to night of October 4, followed by epilogue after TV anime's story    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip shows Odokawa and Shirakawa  talking in a park after ""that incident,"" with Odokawa warning Shirakawa about getting involved with dangerous yakuza-type individuals.         The film will premiere in Japan on Friday, April 1. The television anime's main cast and staff are returning, and ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""

News Odd Taxi Anime Film's Clip Previews New Footage   posted on 2022-03-31 18:43 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Film takes us back to night of October 4, followed by epilogue after TV anime's story    The staff for Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, began streaming a clip from the film on Thursday. The clip shows Odokawa and Shirakawa  talking in a park after ""that incident,"" with Odokawa warning Shirakawa about getting involved with dangerous yakuza-type individuals.         The film will premiere in Japan on Friday, April 1. The television anime's main cast and staff are returning, and ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning. Skirt (singer-songwriter Wataru Sawabe's solo project) and rapper/DJ PUNPEE performed the show's opening theme song ""Odd Taxi,"" and Suzuko Mimori performed the ending theme song ""Sugarless Kiss.""

How many times can Rikiya Koyama and Sayaka Ohara get paired up together? I think this is the 3rd or 4th time.    So the MC has an ex-girlfriend? It seems like he basically left her with just a note to go back to his family's shop and she ended up following him back to Kyoto. I wonder if they'll get back together...   I was not expecting to see Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as a deadbeat dad. Has he played a dad before aside from Kirito?
