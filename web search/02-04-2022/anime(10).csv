News Shueisha Establishes 'Shueisha Games' Company   posted on 2022-03-31 12:04 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Affiliate to develop smartphone games in collaboration with Shonen Jump creators    Shueisha revealed on Thursday that it established a new wholly owned affiliated company named Shueisha Games on February 16. The company aims to develop smartphone games with original concepts and character designs from manga creators from Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine.

Development is already underway with a major overseas game company on an original smartphone game.     The company already lists a number of games that Shueisha previously announced as supporting through its Shueisha Game Creators Camp Project for indie developers, including Kenei Design's Oni, Seaknot Studios and Freaky Design's Ukiyo, Tasto Alpha's Hatena no Tō (The Tower -To the Bottom-), and Momo-Pi's Captain Velvet Meteor: The Jump+ Dimensions.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            feature          36 comments       The Spring 2022 Preview Guide   Apr  2, 08:13 36 comments                 anime    It's time to get the party started!

Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.

The Executioner and Her Way of Life Theme Song Band Mili   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr  1st 2022          International indie rockers Mili made their anisong debut in the 2016 series Bloodivores and have since gone on to contribute themes for  Goblin Slayer, Gleipnir, amd Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045. The group's newest song ""Paper Bouquet"" will be featured as the opening theme in the upcoming anime series The Executioner and Her Way of Life and is available digitally today.    Anime News Network had the opportunity to interview the group's lead vocalist Cassie Wei about the band's unique sound, her anime and manga recommendations, and the upcoming series.    The group 'Mili' formed in 2012, can you tell us how you each met and about the formation of the group?   Cassie Wei: Around a year or two before Mili was formed, I was making covers of Kasai's Vocaloid songs and posting them on YouTube. At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.

At the time, I was in high school, and Kasai was using a different name. When he saw my videos, he got in contact with me through Twitter. He invited me to join his new unit afterwards. It sounded fun so I immediately said yes (laughs). It genuinely has been a lot of fun.    After that, Kasai invited some of his former bandmates: bassist Yukihito and drummer Shoto. Together, we formed Mili, and when we were producing our first album, we had the opportunity to bring the illustrator Ao on board.    Can you talk about your group name, ""Mili"" and the inspiration from the Grimm fairytale? How does the group name represent your music?   Cassie: The Grimm fairytale ""Dear Mili"" is honestly quite an offbeat story, in my opinion (laughs). The message isn't clear, nor does it tell you what the protagonist Mili was feeling, or whether the ending was happy or bad. Yet it's a mysterious tale through which you can feel a sense of beauty. I think that this beautiful yet eerily bizarre aspect is a good match for our style of music.    Vocalist Cassie Wei is multi-talented; on top of singing she also has a degree in software engineering. Does she still have goals of creating computer games in the future?   Cassie: Lately, I've been wanting to express my values in a more easy-to-digest format. I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives      ",positive,en,{}

I love games, of course, and I think it's an excellent medium for deep-diving into a world, but it takes such a long time before you can show your work to other people, so I realized it was unsuited for me. There are so many ideas in my head that I want to express and so many messages I want to convey that it all threatens to get buried. Every day I think of some new kind of story. If I spend too much time on each individual thing, then (as far as I am concerned) I would turn into someone who can't give shape to their ideas. I think that's why I made the switch to writing songs.    How would you describe the mood of your song ""Paper Bouquet?""   Cassie: Fortitude, intensity, and a bit of poignancy, I suppose?    Were there any notes or directions provided by the anime staff for creating the song?   Cassie: We received some advice for the composition from the production side, but they generally left things up to Mili. I have so much gratitude for the production staff who believed in our sound.    Are any of the members anime, manga, or light novel fans? What are some of your favorites?   Cassie: All the members are otaku of some kind (laughs). Although everyone's into different genres. When I was in elementary school, I watched so much anime every day, and I'd even read manga in the bathtub. These days, I'm a fan of Shūzō Oshimi's Blood on the Tracks. I think it's great how it expresses the story and the feelings of the characters not through words but through images.     Are there any anime theme songs that you consider 'iconic' or that you listen to often?   Cassie: I'm quite the anime otaku, so there are way too many songs for comfort (laughs). When I was a kid, Yuki Kajiura's “Akatsuki no Kuruma” (from Mobile Suit Gundam Seed) was a masterpiece to me. Also, when I was in elementary school, I watched Destiny of the Shrine Maiden (not an anime an elementary schoolchild should watch, by the way). I was a huge fan of the ED song “Agony” performed by KOTOKO.    What bands or musicians do you consider major influences?   Cassie: There isn't a specific artist, but I've been influenced a lot by anisongs and J-Pop as a genre. Although I'm Canadian, I've loved anime and games since I was a kid, so I generally listened to anisongs. Anisongs are distinctive for their strong melodies. You don't find songs with such a feeling of presence in the west. It was very novel to me as a child. I suppose that's why Mili songs always have a strong melody line? My flashy melodies complement Kasai's classic and rock band experience. I think that's the source of Mili's unique sound today.    Can you recommend “The Executioner and Her Way of Life” to the western audience？   Cassie: I've seen the completed footage with my own eyes. So I can say this: The animation is sooooo pretty! It's a very impressive show, well worth watching, with solid action scenes. The musical score is a perfect match for each scene, which raises the excitement.    It's an easy anime to get into while also having a very intricate plot and setting. There's a lot of depth to the story. I can absolutely recommend it to people who love fantasy. Even people who don't have much interest in orthodox fantasy or the isekai genre ought to take the opportunity to watch it. It might become a new love for you.    Make sure to watch The Executioner and Her Way of Life!    The Executioner and Her Way of Life will stream on HIDIVE   Readers can find Mili on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple Music.  ",positive,en,{}

Forum - View topicGundam Build Fighters and the Power of Toy Anime             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Rob19ny    Joined: 13 Jun 2020 		    Posts: 964       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 12:07 pm            I knew what I was getting into by watching Build Fighters because this was the period Sunrise had been focusing on children's Gundam with a young MC like in Age before it. I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.      Back to top                  Nyren    Joined: 07 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 663       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:50 pm            I can straight up say that if you thought there was anything special about Sekai, there isn't. His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.

His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff.

If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.      Back to top                  Nyren    Joined: 07 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 663       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:50 pm            I can straight up say that if you thought there was anything special about Sekai, there isn't. His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

In the TCG and gacha community, Bandai is often referred to as one of the worst companies to handle gaming.

This caused many card shops to go under. A lot of store owners and distributors in the west hate bandai with a burning passion. Bandai was so incompetent at tcgs, they killed the naruto tcg at narutos peak popularity. If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

I actually held off on watching BF for that reason (until the Try BD's released), but I decided to give it a chance. But it actually took me by surprise. It was really good. So good that I watched Beginning G afterward. First, the music. BACK-ON doing the OP song and it was a banger per usual let me know that BF was one to keep watching. As I kept watching, it just kept getting more interesting, an enjoyable watch if you will. Then BACK-ON does the 2nd OP song again, but this time with Lil' Fang from FAKY. They transcended to another level. At this point, you have to love BF. While Try wasn't better than BF, the OP songs by BACK-ON and EDGE of LIFE (I was surprised BACK-ON didn't do the 2nd OP, but I loved EoL since Fairy Tail, so it was forgiven) kept the same feeling BF's songs had.   Second, the dual protagonist of Reiji and Sei reminded me of Yami Yugi and Yugi as I kept watching. One takes the backseat to work on the Gunpla while the other does the battling. As stated in chapter 40 something of the Yugioh manga, Yami Yugi and Yugi are two sides of the same coin. Reiji and Sei fit this even though they are not in the same body.   Third, Meiji Kawaguchi. He's so cool. Nuff said.   While I loved BF, the one thing I felt it lacked was waifu's. Sure, there's best girl Aila, but that's it. Rinko is a mother and married (a MILF if you will), and the funny thing is that due to the lack of waifu's, Rinko ends up being the one with the most fan art and doujins. Try improves on this by adding more waifu's. Fumina obviously ends up being the most popular (even Sunrise knows this by making figures of her), then there's Mirai, and Lady Kawaguchi. Heck, even Kaoruko is popular.   BF is best Build series.     Quote:    The protagonist Sei Iori hopes to be a legendary Gunpla battler like his father, but while he is an expert at creating and customizing Gunpla, he's not so great at controlling them. Suddenly, a boy named Reiji mysteriously            Just letting folks know that Reiji and Sei share the role of MC.      Back to top                  Nyren    Joined: 07 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 663       Posted: Fri Apr 01, 2022 4:50 pm            I can straight up say that if you thought there was anything special about Sekai, there isn't. His design is just similar to Reiji. If you watched Island Wars, then you know the character that's actually connected to Reiji. GM's Counterattack provided some much needed closure for Season One, it's just a shame that it came so far after. But I do agree that Try, while not as good as the first season, did tease a third season with a lot of promise for even more payoff. Sadly, we got Divers instead, and it seems they intend to keep doing Divers for now, which is a shame because it's not as good. Re:Rise was a vast improvement over the first Divers, but it still paled in comparison to Build Fighters to me. That being said it's obvious where Bandai's inspiration for their Gundam Metaverse idea came from and that's an idea that they've been cooking for a while now.

In the TCG and gacha community, Bandai is often referred to as one of the worst companies to handle gaming.

Gundam Build Fighters Try was good, but not as good as the original GBF.   Gundam Build Divers was really disappointing.   Gundam Build Divers Re: Rise was better than GBD, but still not as good as GBF.

This caused many card shops to go under. A lot of store owners and distributors in the west hate bandai with a burning passion. Bandai was so incompetent at tcgs, they killed the naruto tcg at narutos peak popularity. If you go to any tcg forum in the west and think bandai is doing okay with, you will be mocked ruthlessly.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

Community score: 4.8            Short episode this week! Only nine minutes long. I saw that there was some big post-credits thing, but didn't bother watching it—just kidding! One of my biggest issues with adaptations is the absence of finality. When it comes to light novels and manga—the two largest sources of anime—they're usually created with the goal of perpetual publication. But it's rare that any anime seeks to actually offer a full adaptation.    That said, Episode 23 is the ending 86 deserved all along. I'll admit, I previously said that I was very satisfied with the ending of the first cour. The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.

The idea that Spearhead Squadron had all been wiped out on their suicide mission and that Lena would work with a new group of 86 to overthrow the current system was narratively appealing, though not at all a feel-good ending like the one that was broadcast today.    This finale, on the other hand, was the perfect send-off for the cast, and we can imagine what sort of lives they'll be living henceforth. While the second cour began with the cast trying out different hobbies and then abandoning them for the battlefield, we see now that they've worked out a balance. It no longer seems like they're fighting just for the sake of fighting, but have finally found lives that they want to protect. It's incredibly sweet. And immediately off the back of finding absolution for his mercy killings, we discover that Nina didn't actually blame Shin for her brother's death, after all. It's a particularly wholesome scene.    Meanwhile, after the first credit roll, we check in on Lena properly for the first time in a while. The institutional discrimination against the 86 within San Magnolia is gone, largely due to there being no more institution. Who knew a robot zombie attack could cure racism? Of course, there's lingering bitterness among the white (haired) refugees, who now have to accept the aid of people of color(ed hair). It's been a long time since cour 1, so I'd forgotten how silly the hair racism looked.    Episode 23 wasn't the mind-blowing spectacle that the previous episode was, but one short sequence at the very end will stick with me for a while. Whoever first suggested Fido-cam is a storytelling genius. Anime is constantly looking for new ways to get viewers to feel closer to the characters, and the home movie style through Fido's lens is a particularly warm and fitting way to convey the cast's final thoughts.    Honestly, the whole finale is unbearably cheesy, but that's exactly what we all deserve. The reunion almost brought me to tears. We've been waiting all this time for Lena and the members of Spearhead to stand within the same frame together, and we got exactly that. Sure, it was absolutely ridiculous that Lena and Shin hold out their hands to each other to form the number “86”, but that's how a fluffy finale should feel.    Of course, the story will continue in some form. The eleventh light novel released in Japan last month, and I've been informed that there are some great stories to come. Not so sure about the implied Shin/Lena romance, though. Yen Press has the license to the series and the tenth English volume will be released in May. At the same time, I'd also strongly recommend getting your hands on the 86 Bandai model kits. They're not too difficult to build and they end up looking really similar to the ones in the anime.    On my end, I'll be saying goodbye to 86 here. It's been the highlight of 2021 (and now 2022, I guess) and absolutely deserved its Best New Anime award at Anime Trending. I reckon I'll be looking back fondly at the show for a while. Though, of course, if they do end up making more of this wonderful anime adaptation, I'll be right back here alongside you all.
