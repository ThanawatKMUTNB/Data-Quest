In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

In the Land of Leadale Episode 12  by MrAJCosplay/Cartoon Cipher, Mar 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 12 of In the Land of Leadale ?                     Community score: 3.8          Here we are at the proper conclusion of The Land of Leadale and… I still have no idea what this show was trying to do or even who it was for. I wasn't expecting answers to most, if really any, questions about the overall inciting incident behind the show's premise or even some of the narrative loose ends like the rest of the player characters that are still trapped in this world. Even then, turns out the only loose end that DOES get wrapped up is the whole thing with the mermaid that Cayna saved from a few episodes back.   It's built up as this emotional thing like how she's finally found her place in the world, but since I literally don't know anything about this character outside of what she just dumped on us in this episode, I have no emotional investment in any of this. The same can be said for the resolution involving Cayna's new daughter who is slowly building up the courage to call Cayna her mother. It's treated as this really touching moment when it finally does happen, but I don't know anything about this character either. I can infer some things, but considering what she actually went through, the show doesn't really give us an idea of what this exchange actually means for either of these characters. It's nice to see Cayna being a responsible mother, especially since she arguably spends most of the show being terrible to children that more or less grew up without her, but I don't know what being a mother actually means to Cayna. If anything, her decision to take on that role felt more like a recent revelation when it should have been a culmination of her character arc. Either I'm missing something or the show is once again treating the audience as if they have more knowledge than they reasonably should. Maybe the show was only intended for people that were fans of the original source material all along? Apparently a lot of things were cut out for the sake of getting us to this point and if that's true then I'm even more confused.    Some of the final shots and narration in the finale carry this sense of whimsical free-spiritedness. It was nice to hear Cayna reflect on how this all started and how her death gave her the opportunity to go on adventures in this current life. That is technically true, though I still feel like the show isn't really aware of anything going on in its own narrative. If the show just wanted to be about Cayna finding a new life in this world, then why involve other people from her past life in the plot at all? It would have been more convincing as a simple escapist fantasy or even just a nice story about a girl who got a second chance at a better life.    If there was an actual progression to her getting to this life of contentment, then I could actually see myself being warmed to this conclusion. But most of Cayna's actions throughout this entire show have just been reacting to things that she arguably took for granted like her family and trying to figure out how things got the way that they did which wasn't really resolved or reflected upon at all. Maybe it's implied, but I actually would've been OK if Cayna just realized it's not worth exploring the rest of this world because there is no point in even reflecting on her old life. Instead, it's framed as if it was never that important in the first place. If that really is the case then I'm sorry because at best it makes me feel bad for all of the other player characters that were trapped in here through no fault of their own, and at worst it just makes everything else feel like a massive waste of time with a narrative as scattered and all over the place as its main character.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3888       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

Every week I'm ready to drop this, but then I don't and now we're half way through I'll probably stick with it (unless someone tells me it's slated for 24 or a split cour, in which case I'm out right now).   This show sure is lucky it doesn't air on the weekend, or I wouldn't have bothered with it.

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

REVIEW: Tokyo 24th Ward             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Thu Jan 20, 2022 3:55 pm            A fair review. I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3888       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

Quote:    The best it can offer is Ran trying to talk Kunai down with the base argument of ""This isn't how we do things"" because killing is badong.            So like this... but the part that came after it which negates it.  These reviews are awful.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

Well, Lupin III already gave us a ""Gun of Jigen"" in episode 8 last month, so it wouldn't be surprising for the idea to show up here too.       Back to top                  Spider3PO    Joined: 08 Jan 2022 		    Posts: 16       Posted: Wed Jan 26, 2022 3:32 pm            Episode 4: Corrects the ship, so to speak. The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.      Back to top                  Animegomaniac    Joined: 16 Feb 2012 		    Posts: 3888       Posted: Fri Jan 28, 2022 12:58 pm            I went into this series with one simple fact: Red, blue and green are a spectrum and these reviews that keep trying to break this analogue set up into digital descriptions is frustrating. The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I enjoyed ep 1 & 2. But with 3, that tornado was left field. I didn't like that twist.   They had already started foreshadowing two different groups as being shady. And neither of them played into being at the heart of the crisis this week. Not even the group that tried to cheat.   It's as if the showrunner thought a unexpected plot twist was more important then putting in the work via foreshadowing to make it a meaningful payoff. Just to subvert expectations on what the crisis was going to be. It bugs me.    Unless there was some clue I missed in 2 & 3 to suggest a natural disaster was coming this episode? Cause I don't remember anything like that.

I don't know, everywhere? This is an A++ series for me but I don't even know where to begin in explaining how great I think it is...   Yes, you picked up on the Trolley one and the show pointed it out but the second chaos point was centered around... political ideals of all things, the Libertarian versus the Liberal. Survival of the fittest versus protecting the weak. ""Taking the third option"" in the Trolley problem is par for the course but it's a lot more nuanced when it comes to politics built into your blood.    It's not ""working together"" though, it should be working parallel.

The foreshadowing sets up the next crisis (as it spoiler[bleepin] should). Rather then coming out of left field with the tornado the last episode and killing off a semi-important support character. But I'm sure there's still time for the next episode to mess that up. Thanks episode 3 for planting that seed of doubt in me. Anyways...   Someone pointed out that the Hazard Cast machine maybe a macguffin that creates these chaotic scenarios. It's possible. But I've got a different theory involving Carneades.    The big bad Carneades is going to be a Moriarty like figure in this, exploiting Hazard Cast. With the Tornado, he likely prevented the radar from doing it's job. Rather then create a tornado with unknown tech.    With this new crisis involving the ship, I'm just going to wait and see before diving too deep into how this could connect to Carneades, Hazard Cast, and Asumi.   Random notes:  - Ran continues to baffle me. In episode 2, he's dunking bread crusts into an energy drink (gross).   - In this episode, Ran is like ""screw physics"" while his skateboard remains magically glued to his feet as he swings through the air like Tarzan in the Concrete Jungle.   - So Drug D is basically PCP (Angel Dust)?   To close, this series is pretty good. It's a B- for me so far. Maybe it can become an A+ in the future. We'll see.

The problems are broken down into binary, yes, but the solution should be more of a spectrum. To paraphrase what Mari aid about RBG: Everything can handle everything. But what about the individual colors?   ""Shu's in the middle."" Yes""... and that makes him central good."" No, that should make him True Neutral. Looking at Red we have Chaotic Good and at green, it's lawful evil.  Koki's an unapologetic fascist, can we come out and admit that? He's also a Libertarian but I feel that would kicking him while he's down already.    But why is Shu the superhero and not Ran? Something something responsibility, something power right? With great responsibility comes great power... and somebody went out of their way to make it into a superhero series. So Shu has to be the hero with hour of power because he's the responsible one.   That leaves Ran, who's interestingly no Robin Hood. He's self involved, he's particular, he's selective. Token Evil Teammate, the Heart and to top it off, the Lovable Rogue. No, I'm missing something about Ran because that should be heroic but something about Ran isn't, just like Koki by himself isn't a hero... Red should be hero, Blue should be lancer, hmm...   Is it really that simple? That Ran isn't dependable? ... and even the teamings are balanced; Ran has a group of Individuals he represents more than leads, Koki has no power over those SERG agents or the woman who's tied to, well, that but he does seem to lead them when the time comes to lead them.   Take this next problem... and review on it please. Shu is not going to be the one to decides who lives and who dies like Ran or Koki, the chaotic and evil people. He's going to save all of them because it's the right thing to do.   And I probably could keep going about this series as I do love it but not for what it's saying but what it says when it's not saying anything meaningful. So you'll see your politics reinforced because they're your politics and you can pick apart ones you disagree with because they're not.   Also... leaving this for last: the 24 ward is a manufactured place so all problems plaguing it are also manufactured, that's the point. The plot.

As politely as possible. Cause there's some overthinking in there (eps 4 & 5), like Tokyo 24th Ward is supposed to be Shakespere when the level of writing is closer to Die Hard.   I don't know what you were expecting when a story arc is typically only an hour long (two episodes). They were never going to go deep into the division of classes. If that's what you were expecting. The first episode should have clued you in on how ""deep"" this show was going to be.     Quote:    But Tokyo 24th Ward can only articulate the world's stupidest moral dilemmas...            I would say specializes in simplified moral dilemmas that have to be solved in an hour of runtime. Maybe if this was Netflix, they could dedicate a season to a trolley dilemma. To really get to the heart of the issues the story may have brought up that led to the dilemma. But I imagine much of the audience would check out. Few showrunners could pull that off.     Quote:    ""I can't protect criminals,"" Koki intones at the end of this week's episode. It's a laugh given that we know the drug-dealing, land-sharking rich people on the ship are hardly law-abiding either            Do we though? Is the Captain of the ship in on it? The ship staff? The entertainment? Some of the plus ones invited to this? You're telling me they're all in on the shady deals? That just by being on the ship with shady people that it would be fine if the ship blew up?   Okay, if you say so.     Quote:    ...but it doesn't seem like any of the characters, nor the writer, nor the audience, walked away actually having learned anything about the ethics of these supposedly hard choices.            Yeah, I never expected that. Again, it should have been clear early on that this show was never going to be that deep or dramatic.

Given how much time is spent on the background of the supposed antagonist here, I was basically crushed when he was killed, though ofc not everyone on that boat was in any sense guilty. We aren’t meant to uncritically laud either the cops or the black-and-white thinking of Koki more generally here. Honestly, the amazing thing is that Ran and Koki can get along at all given their outlooks are so disparate, but it looks like this might be the thing that actually drives a wedge (which, good). Other than that, I didn’t love that Shu is kind of useless in this ep, but at the same time, I kind of like that action-man can’t just fix everything, too.

Quote:    how much of these events they actually set in motion purposefully            It's easy to mix up purposely and purposefully.  One trick is to think about their opposites, which are quite different:   purposely means ""on purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""by accident"" or ""unintentionally.""   purposefully means ""full of purpose,"" so it's the opposite of ""pointlessly"" or ""aimlessly.""

I thought in a series trying to point out binary choices in an analogue world would have Azumi both alive, really alive, and 100% dead.... and then the series took a further step I didn't expect.   ""The system is called KANAE and its receptacle is BRAIN.""  My reaction was not and I mean not ""OMG, that is Azumi."" This isn't that kind of series; Ran's a coward, Koki's a fascist because they are what they look like as this is not a nuanced or subtle series. So if they give you Azumi's body but call her by her mother's name, it's time to ask yourself ""What's in the Brain Box?!""

As it was presented, lightning would strike the cranes making them fall and lightning would strike the only person who could prevent them from falling. So save the person from the lightning and then they can stop the cranes?  Where's the difficult choice?   I think my brain is just too clogged with general crap to function any more, so no one need waste their time explaining something that's obvious to the average viewer.  I probably won't be able to understand that either, and it's not like I'm losing sleep over this.

My first thought was, ""Um, didn't we already know all this before?""  I guess the origin of the stupid name ""0th"" was kinda new, but I hadn't been wondering about that at all before now.   Sadly, my main takeaway from this was wondering how he got cut on the right side of his face when the broken car window was on his left.

I was surprised at how much love, wholesomeness, and affection could be squeezed out from such a dreary and at times lewd premise. ― Despite the rather dark implications of the overall premise, I thought it was just another entry in the growing list of anime that are now making up this “teasing genre.” Than...                    review          2 comments       Came the Mirror & Other Tales GN   Jan 19, 01:00 2 comments                 manga    Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work. ― Even with limited character designs and plots that don't quite hit as hard as they need to in the end, it's hard to fault Rumiko Takahashi's shorter work.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    review          8 comments       Selection Project   Jan 17, 01:00 8 comments                 anime    When it's not bogging itself down with tonal filler, Selection Project is filling the central character conflict of its reality-show story with some of the wildest plot twists I've encountered in a series like this recently. ― A crowded field like idol anime means a series needs to have its own particular identity to stand out, and Selection Project's approach seems to be to pitch itself as at least ...                    review          3 comments       Shikizakura Episodes 1-12   Jan 16, 01:00 3 comments                 anime    As far as what it's playing with in terms of influence and genre stylings, Shikizakura is tokusatsu as all heck. ― Tokusatsu has enjoyed a run of increased availability and visibility among English-speaking audiences, particularly those adjacent to anime fan circles, for a good several years now. It's to the point where many more people than before have an idea of what tokusatsu 'is' (or at least the...                    review          7 comments       Farewell, My Dear Cramer   Jan  5, 01:00 7 comments                 anime    Farewell, My Dear Cramer, with its themes of how neglected women's soccer has become compared to its male equivalent, ironically received such a poor production that it actively hampered its ability to tell its story for much of its run. ― I cannot begin to describe how excited I was for Farewell, My Dear Cramer at first.

It's a 'Man Versus Wild' situation if said Wild also had goblins in it. ― Alright, another new isekai, what's the deal with this one?

That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    review          5 comments       The Lines that Define Me GN 1   Feb 22, 01:00 5 comments                 manga    One young man's foray into classic Japanese art might just be his path to healing. ― Although The Lines that Define Me is about suiboku-ga, or traditional Japanese ink painting, that's really only the vehicle through which the characters express themselves. Aoyama, the protagonist, is clearly not doing well from the moment we meet him setting up for an art exhibit – he's worryingly lightheaded as he ...                    review          10 comments       The Two Lions GN   Feb 21, 01:00 10 comments                 manga    One of Furuya's strengths as a storyteller is the ability to carefully and quietly capture real emotions of the sort that we typically hide inside ourselves; the insecurities that grow unchecked and cause people to misunderstand us. ― The Two Lions is Nagisa Furuya's third English language release – Renta brought over S & N and Kodansha released My Summer of You – and if there's one thing all three t...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way.

It's a 'Man Versus Wild' situation if said Wild also had goblins in it. ― Alright, another new isekai, what's the deal with this one?
