Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 12 of Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   In exchange for the fulfillment of a wish, Magical Girls keep fighting, unbeknownst to the rest of the world. But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them.

The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.

But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.

Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

But Iroha Tamaki can't seem to remember her wish. There is a gaping hole in her life. Something important has been lost. But she continues to fight every day, without even knowing why. Then, a rumor begins to spread among Magical Girls. Magical Girls can be saved if they go to Kamihama City, the city where Magical Girls and Uwasa are gathering.    Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story is based on a spinoff game of the Puella Magi Madoka Magica anime and streams on Crunchyroll and Funimation.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                I'm just going to get the full title out of the way up top, since it tells you everything you need to know about the show. This is Magia Record: Puella Magi Madoka Magica Side Story Final Season -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, a four-episode mini-season that is meant to conclude the nearly three-year-long odyssey of this messy but ambitious Madoka Magica spinoff. It seems odd to call this a “preview"" since in just this one episode we're covering a full quarter of this long-awaited conclusion, but thems the breaks, I suppose.    Going into -The Dawn of the Ephemeral Dream-, the main question on everyone's mind, including mine, is going to be whether or not a mere four-episode arc will be enough to draw the story of Magia Record to a satisfying conclusion. The thing about “We Failed” is that it's a flashback episode, devoted entirely to explaining the origins of the antagonist cadre of Magical Girls known as the Wings of Magius, so we don't get much in the way of narrative progression here. The good news is that, so far as infodump episodes go, “We Failed” is a doozy, answering many of the long-standing mysteries that Magia Record has been dangling over its viewers' heads for the past few years.    Granted, none of these answers are necessarily revelatory; given everything we learned about Ui, Nemu, and Touka last season, it was easy enough to figure out the broad strokes of this backstory ahead of time. Still, seeing everything laid out in a more traditional narrative fashion sure is satisfying for longtime viewers of the series, and it helps to contextualize a lot of elements of the series as we head into Magia Record's final act. The full scope of Ui's disappearance from the world is explained, we understand how all three of the Hospital Gang ended up as Magical Girls in the first place, and how Touka became the Uwasa creating villain that she was in the first two seasons of the show. We even finally get an explanation for Baby Kyubey, and it's a lot more reasonable than I was expecting!    The second season of the show was also notable for its extreme highs and lows in production quality. A few of its episodes ranked among the best spectacle that the franchise has ever delivered, and at the same time, the final entries of the season were stretched so thin that you could practically see the bubblegum and duct tape that the artists at Studio Shaft were using to hold the production together. “We Failed” is by no means the prettiest episode of Madoka Magica ever produced, but it looks solid, and my biggest hope for this extra-short final season is that the overall aesthetic of the franchise isn't compromised because of scheduling and production errors. Lord knows that the poor crew deserves one hell of a vacation at this point.    All that said, do I think that Magia Record's final season will end up doing the spinoff justice? It's tough to say. I've always had a mixed relationship with Magia Record; at its best, it feels like a genuine and compelling expansion of the entire Madoka Magica universe, but at its worst, it becomes borderline incomprehensible. I think the good of the series generally outweighs the bad, though, and if you're at all a fan of the Madoka Magica franchise, I believe (and I hope) that you'll have a mostly good time with Magia Record. Just, you know, make sure to watch the other two seasons first if you're new to the series.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               This episode might as well have been called “30 Minutes of Answers.” In one self-contained flashback, it lays out every major remaining mystery in the series and thoroughly unravels them. However, the way it does this feels completely natural through yet another story of Madoka Magica-themed suffering.    As it goes with most of these stories, it begins with Kyubey preying on Iroha's fears for Ui and tricking her into becoming a magical girl. What's interesting here is that Ui, Nemu, and Touka are able to see through Kyubey's half-truths and uncover what is really going on. And like Madoka in the main series, the three sickly girls figure out the bunny-cat's biggest weakness: he has to grant wishes. He literally can't stop himself.    This, of course, kicks off their search for the perfect wish—or rather, set of wishes—to break Kyubey's system and allow the remaining magical girls to live normally even after all witches are exterminated. Their solution is basically to become Kyubey themselves—feeding the collected energy back into the magical girls rather than keeping it for themselves. The problem is that they never considered what would happen to the one taking in all the negative magical girl emotions—i.e., that they'd become a witch in seconds.    Basically, this episode is a tragedy centered around hubris. The three girls think that after a bit of research they can game the system and save the world. But instead, they arguably make things worse, leading to almost all of the tragedy we've seen in the series so far.    What's truly heartbreaking, though, is the effect that comes from isolating Ui's fractured soul inside of Kyubey. Like with Madoka at the end of the main series, this places her outside of reality—as if she never existed in the first place. This drastically changes the personalities of those closest to her (namely, Touka) and makes the previous seasons gain yet another layer of tragedy in retrospect. All in all, it's a fantastic amalgamation of lore and character building that has me pumped to see where things will go in our final three episodes.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.

Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
24-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol.

Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
24-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.

News 'Play It Cool, Guys' Manga Gets TV Anime in October   posted on 2022-04-22 18:49 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Chiaki Kon directs anime at Studio Pierrot     Studio Pierrot announced on Friday that it is producing a television anime adaptation of Kokone Nata's Play It Cool, Guys (Cool Doji Danshi) manga that will premiere in October. The studio also revealed the anime's teaser promotional video, key visual, cast, and staff.       Nata also drew an image to celebrate the announcement (the sign being held in the image below features the phrase ""anime adaptation announcement!"" but the sign is upside-down).     The anime will star:    Chiaki Kobayashi as Hayate Ichihara   Kouki Uchiyama as Shun Futami   Yuichiro Umehara as Takayuki Mima   Shōya Chiba as Sōma Shiki    Chiaki Kon (Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal: Season III, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal, The Way of the Househusband, Junjō Romantica) is directing the anime at Studio Pierrot. Makoto Uezu (Assassination Classroom, Yuki Yuna Is a Hero, Space Brothers) is overseeing the series scripts, and Airi Taguchi (key animation for Children of the Sea, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? second season) is serving as both character designer and chief animation director. Masato Nakayama (B-PROJECT, We Never Learn: BOKUBEN, You and Me.) is composing the music.    Yen Press is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Enter: a bunch of cool guys who look like they got that unapproachable swag. But let's be real—that's not the true them. They're just a bunch of dorks who've got the act down pat. So sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching a bunch of goofy guys try to look cool all day every day. Play It Cool, Guys is a fun collection of stories featuring guys that are equal parts cool and equal parts adorably awkward.   Yen Press is publishing the manga in full color, as it was originally released in Japan. Yen Press will release the third compiled volume on May 24.    Nata launched the manga in June 2019 on the Gangan pixiv website. Square Enix published the fourth volume on November 22. The manga ranked #16th for the 2020 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook for its female readers list.

News 'Play It Cool, Guys' Manga Gets TV Anime in October   posted on 2022-04-22 18:49 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Chiaki Kon directs anime at Studio Pierrot     Studio Pierrot announced on Friday that it is producing a television anime adaptation of Kokone Nata's Play It Cool, Guys (Cool Doji Danshi) manga that will premiere in October. The studio also revealed the anime's teaser promotional video, key visual, cast, and staff.       Nata also drew an image to celebrate the announcement (the sign being held in the image below features the phrase ""anime adaptation announcement!"" but the sign is upside-down).     The anime will star:    Chiaki Kobayashi as Hayate Ichihara   Kouki Uchiyama as Shun Futami   Yuichiro Umehara as Takayuki Mima   Shōya Chiba as Sōma Shiki    Chiaki Kon (Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal: Season III, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal, The Way of the Househusband, Junjō Romantica) is directing the anime at Studio Pierrot. Makoto Uezu (Assassination Classroom, Yuki Yuna Is a Hero, Space Brothers) is overseeing the series scripts, and Airi Taguchi (key animation for Children of the Sea, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? second season) is serving as both character designer and chief animation director. Masato Nakayama (B-PROJECT, We Never Learn: BOKUBEN, You and Me.) is composing the music.    Yen Press is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Enter: a bunch of cool guys who look like they got that unapproachable swag. But let's be real—that's not the true them. They're just a bunch of dorks who've got the act down pat. So sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching a bunch of goofy guys try to look cool all day every day. Play It Cool, Guys is a fun collection of stories featuring guys that are equal parts cool and equal parts adorably awkward.   Yen Press is publishing the manga in full color, as it was originally released in Japan. Yen Press will release the third compiled volume on May 24.    Nata launched the manga in June 2019 on the Gangan pixiv website. Square Enix published the fourth volume on November 22. The manga ranked #16th for the 2020 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook for its female readers list. The manga also placed seventh in pixiv and Nippon Shuppan Hanbai, Inc's ""Web Manga General Election"" in 2019.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

IE: blanket statements that ignore the fact that there is a legitimate demand for sexualized teenagers from other sexual teenagers.   I agree that sexualized teens in a magazine for adults is creepy.  However, adults being creepy (even still, just drawings) shouldn't result in blanket bans of this nature IMO      Back to top                  Gem-Bug    Joined: 10 Nov 2018 		    Posts: 581       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 4:29 pm              Cutty Mink wrote:    I see where I didn’t clarify my point and apologize   I'm talking more so about the broad concept of banning any and all material that depicts minors sexually.

However, adults being creepy (even still, just drawings) shouldn't result in blanket bans of this nature IMO            So what, you want materials with teens depicted sexually, for teens, and accessible by teens? And you think creep adults aren't just going to legally purchase it anyway?

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

I think censorship is very bad (gov't or public platforms). Platforms filtering what they promote themselves is necessary, but toxic internet culture pressuring for censorship is not ideally the way this should happen. Constructive criticism is good. If we want to break and destroy stereotypes about women or at least give women more agency in media, it is in our best interests to create and promote better works that reflect our values. Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

Platforms should do the same.   There are exceptions to this, but mostly limited to what can be proven with data and analysis to have been explicitely harmful or dangerous to others. ie. Calls for threats, discrimination, etc.   I still think Akamatsu-sensei is fighting the good fight alongside other creators and a few politicians of like mind, but criticism is not the same as censorship, and we can draw a pretty fine line between the two.

Even I don't like the depiction in certain manga/anime (heck I may even find them disgusting!) I find the pressure to ""regulate"" the industry out of the line.  Also, ""bad ideas"" are fought by open debate and discussion, not by trying to remove them out of existence.  A harsh debate on forums like this ,for example, is much better than saying ""this depiction isn't allowed"", IMO.  I personally think platform filtering is not working (who decides? how? There are too many problems). It creates the opposite effect.

Series' like Ranma 1/2 and To Love Ru were very important, formative experiences for my sexuality when I was fifteen.   I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  Why should we ban ecchi manga made for a teen demographic just because the wrong demographic might buy it?  Further more, why does it even matter to anyone if an adult buys an ecchi high school manga?   So yes, teens, who are at an incredibly sexually volatile age, should. IMO, should be allowed to enjoy ecchi content in their age range.  Why the hell should they be punished because adult buys the manga?  Teens are attracted to one another and want to read this content.

This advertisement joined an international organization dedicated to reducing sexism in media. Did so of their own volition. If this organization deems that this advertisement violates their standards that is the organization's prerogative. This publication needs to either adhere to the requirements of this organization or leave. If this politician objects to the standards or decisions of this organization he is free to join it and attempt to influence them. Otherwise, this is not his business.   2. The issues that this fellow is raising are all wrong. It would be one thing if this manga contains pictures of skimpily dressed high school girls for the benefit of a high school boy audience. Yes, adult men and others outside the demographic would still buy it but hey, free society and nothing you can do about that so long as you don't do anything to court the other demographics. Like, I don't know, advertise your manga in a magazine aimed at adult men which appears to be in this case. But this isn't what is going on in this instance. Instead, the guys in this work are salarymen. Guys in their 30s even. Meaning the target audience - the entire point of this work - grown men who fantasize about high school girls. Which is exactly the sort of thing that this U.N. organization is objecting to.   I won't get into the bigger debates like feminism, objectification, censorship etc. Instead, in this specific instance the organization was 100% right: if you want to be a member in our group don't run ads for a manga that markets fantasies of high school girls to adult men. That really is all that is going on here, and this politician is wrong for using this issue out of context to promote his own agenda that has nothing to do with it.

Can you please explain or elaborate? Thank you.            Well for one, I'd suggest reading the original article on this whole incident, where it's made clear that the issue the UN group had wasn't with the Tawawa manga - they explicitly state the creator and publisher have a right to publish it - but with the Nikkei newspaper - but a business oriented paper that ran an advertisement for the manga.    Specifically, the issue is that the Nikkei had signed an agreement with the UN group to not publish ads or promote works that objectify women. And while the advert itself is fairly tame by Tawawa's standards, that doesn't negate that the manga itself is most definitely about objectifying women. I don't think anyone, even diehard fans of the series, could argue that isn't part of the appeal. And since that's a pretty clear violation of the agreement they signed, the UN group sent a letter calling for an explanation.   But apparently people are allergic to reading and have taken the story to be ""UN tries to censor a fanservice manga"" like the person I quoted.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"       How Far Does Forgiveness Go? Ranking of Kings Ending Explained   by Michael Basile, Apr 16th 2022            Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.

No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now.

Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"          Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved.

Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"         Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"      Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.    In a sense, Bojji's arc is not so much about gaining the physical strength to become a better leader, but more so about coming to understand himself so as to highlight the talents he already has. Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.    With this being a fantasy series centered around a monarchical power struggle, betrayal and backstabbing are very much the order of the day for a large chunk of the plot, especially with Bojji being a potential rival for the throne. Even after the high ranking officials of the kingdom supplant Bojji's claim and choose Daida as the new king, Miranjo still convinces Daida that Bojji must be disposed of, and so Domas, Bojji's sword instructor, is tasked with his assassination and would have succeeded if Kage had not been there to save Bojji from his fate.    When Bojji and Domas meet again after this incident, Bojji is nearly paralyzed by fear, still believing Domas to be someone who will bring him harm. Even after Domas apologizes profusely and begs for forgiveness, Bojji runs away, unable to fully process the conflicting emotions swirling around in his head. He wants to forgive Domas, the person who's been by his side so often and tried his best to help Bojji improve his swordsmanship, even going so far as to learn sign language in order to better communicate with him, but Domas's betrayal still hangs heavy in his mind, and so he's simply not ready to forgive him yet. Kage seems to recognize this and, rather than keep trying to convince Bojji to forgive him, he runs off with Bojji to support him, knowing that this issue will take some time. It's a complicated and interesting topic to tackle, recognizing that forgiveness should occur, but simply not being ready to fully resolve those emotions, making Bojji's emotional arc regarding this issue quite compelling.    That said, as strong as that specific plotline is, not everyone seems to be given the same level of care and depth when it comes to the idea of forgiveness. Quite frankly, most of the characters are unusually quick to forgive their enemies and welcome them back into the fold despite the transgressions they've committed, and it begins to strain credibility on all parties involved. With Bojji, a quick forgiveness would make sense since he's just a wholesome little ball of wonder, but even he had to pump the brakes a bit before forgiving Domas.    It feels as though the story is trying to transfer the emotional arc Bojji experienced onto every other character in the show and it's just not landing for me, especially when it comes to the central antagonist, Miranjo. With her being the mastermind behind the attempted coup and destruction of Bosse's kingdom, her list of offenses is easily the longest from this cast, and she's also the only one to bring about the death of a named character, that being Bojji's mother, Shiina, who dies horrifically in front of Bojji as Miranjo is laying siege to the kingdom while Bosse is away.    Despite this connection, Bojji is not the one who gets tied to Miranjo in this series. It's Daida who is positioned as the one to play off of Miranjo during the present-day section of this plot, with Miranjo acting as his advisor through the magic mirror and her past self interacting with him inside his mind while Bosse is in control of his body. It's through Miranjo that Daida is led towards purging his advisors of dissent and even attempting to have his own brother killed, ultimately leading to him being trapped in his own mind after Miranjo used his body to resurrect Bosse. In theory, this should have led to a similar forgiveness arc in which Daida comes to terms with how Miranjo has wronged him, sorted through his feelings, and then eventually came around to forgiving her. Not exactly the same, but similar in that an arc should exist.    But, that's not what we got. Instead, Daida just skips straight to step three and not only forgives Miranjo immediately after learning that she had been deceiving him this whole time, but also declares that he will marry her in an attempt to lead her down the right path in the future. No intense thought given to how this situation has complicated his feelings for Miranjo. He just gets over it immediately and decides to reform her, glossing over what could have been a very interesting character dynamic.    Also, what about Bojji? Like I know that we'd kinda be repeating his forgiveness arc again, but he still had to watch his mother die in front of him because of Miranjo. That trauma is still very much baked into Bojji's character, and yet the only thing we get from Bojji on the matter is him telling Hiling that's Miranjo's cool now. It's uh…a bit hollow in my opinion, and that's to say nothing of all the other people Miranjo has wronged throughout the series on various levels. Yes Daida basically orders them to forgive her, but they certainly don't seem to be holding in any conflicting emotions. With the very brief exception of Hiling, everyone's totally on the same page about forgiving Miranjo, and it feels kind of insincere.    The story tries to dance around this by not having Miranjo, or really any character for that matter, actually get anyone killed during the present-day of this story, but this also ends up coming back to bite it as massive tonal dissonance with its own set of issues. Despite the dismemberments and desanguinations and all other methods of inflicting pain in battle, the fact that pretty much no one is killed by another person, with the exception of Bojji's mother and one other example we'll discuss in just a moment, relieves the story of having to answer that final question. Could these characters forgive each other if they actually did kill their friend or apprentice or any kind of close relation? We know Bojji can because his life has naturally sculpted him into being the most altruistic and kind-hearted person in the show, but it never forces the other characters to follow suit. Everyone makes it out of this coup alive, and even those with severe injuries like dismemberment get prosthetics attachments out of nowhere, so it never has to test the resolve of these other characters and see whether they could follow Bojji's lead in the face of something that really can't be taken back.    This does, however, bring us to the incredibly unpleasant elephant in the room: episode 18, in which we are shown Miranjo's back story and how she came to suffer the trauma conveyed to us through her talks with Daida. Now, before we dive into this, I do want to at least present the notion that most of this information is conveyed through Bosse, who, due to the circumstances we're about to discuss, could be considered an unreliable narrator. However, the story still has yet to present anything that even remotely disputes what Bosse says, and we even see the perspective of other characters that line up with this story, so to me, the validity of this interpretation leans more towards truth than fiction. Perhaps a somewhat exaggerated truth, but a truth nonetheless. In any case, Miranjo and her mother were residents of Houma, a kingdom that sought to “modernize” the kingdom of Gyakuza so as to borrow their aid in the fight against the gods. Despite the goodwill of Houma, the people of Gyakuza remained ever-skeptical and deceitful, which the show directly states is a fundamental trait of all of Gyakuza's citizens as a result of their geopolitical history, a shockingly black-and-white statement considering how nuanced the story has been previously.    Because of this, Miranjo's mother is killed in cold blood by the people of Gyakuza and Miranjo herself is horrifically maimed, with her hands cut off and the skin on her face peeled away. This heinous treatment sends Bosse into a blind rage in which he kills seemingly every resident of the town, even young children. In a more nuanced circumstance, this moment would actually play into the theme of forgiveness and show that Bosse and Miranjo were lacking in the same willpower that Bojji possesses. However, because the people of Gyakuza are presented as unambiguously and unilaterally evil and cruel, there is no reason to forgive them because there is no suggestion that they are deserving of forgiveness. The story has completely dehumanized these people to the point of them barely being human anymore.    Again, this could very well be the result of Bosse being an unreliable narrator regarding his interaction with Gyakuza, but because we are never shown evidence to the contrary and we see the perspective of a third party, we kinda have to assume that this is the truth until proven otherwise, and that's extremely troubling. This incredibly yikes portrayal of an entire civilian population gets upgraded to YIKES when you see the immensely uncomfortable parallels to the real life history of Japan's colonization of Korea, complete with visual similarities. This is a very deep and troubling nationalistic hole to go down, but even without the historical parallels, these events feel obscenely out of character for this series, as though it didn't know how to justify Miranjo's tragic back story, and it ends up making said back story weaker as a result because of how comically evil it is.    This effect can also be seen to a lesser degree with Ouken, an immortal with a thirst for blood and violence. What irks me about this character is that his plight is only conveyed in words spoken by other characters, not through his own actions. We see what he's like after immortality has driven him mad, and we see what he was like before his immortality, but the steps in-between have been cut entirely, steps that are arguably the most important part of a character whose defining personality trait is being driven to insanity. There's nothing to empathize with in Ouken because his entire descent into madness was not elaborated on, and his character wasn't exactly really fleshed-out beforehand, making him nothing more than a rampaging monster who enjoys slitting wrists and torturing his opponents. Much like the people of Gyakuza, Ouken has been completely dehumanized, thus removing him entirely from the forgiveness equation even though he easily gives Miranjo a run for her money in terms of the most harm done to other characters. I do hope that this will eventually be resolved since Ouken still remains part of the story at the end, but for now he just feels hollow and disappointing.    And so, in the end, I'm left with half a story I really love and another half I just don't feel invested in at all. The dynamic between physical appearance and actual ability was immensely interesting and truly endeared me to characters like Bojji and Kage who were desperately trying to live as equals to everyone else in the world they inhabit, and I'm very curious as to what direction the manga takes these characters after the events we've seen thus far. On the other hand, the severe lack of true consequences for a large bulk of this plot makes the theme of forgiveness feel rather infantile, almost contrived at times. The idea that everyone's getting along just fine after this cheapens the depth of this message. It's easy to forgive someone when everything's completely healed up at the end, but it's quite another when there's actual fallout to deal with, and Ranking of Kings clumsily sidesteps said fallout and comes out weaker for it. I still enjoyed my experience on the whole, especially considering the insanely strong animation and artwork provided by Wit Studio, but it's still a much shallower enjoyment than what could have been.

Ranking of Kings Ending Explained - Anime News Network:SEA,"     Across two anime seasons packed with heavy-hitting sequels and long-awaited adaptations, the fact that Ranking of Kings has managed to stay near the top of seasonal discussions for almost half a year is a testament to how engaging this series is and how many ideas it has within it to talk about. That said, for as solid as the project is on the whole, not all ideas are created equal, so join me on a dive into some of this show's disparate themes as we try to see what final conclusion this show arrived at.    Before we jump in I wanna do a brief recap of where this story ended up at the end just to keep it in mind as we discuss what led up to it, and I want to focus primarily on two of the major end results. Firstly, we have Bojji's final battle with Bosse. Whereas Bosse continues to fight Bojji with the same brute force he always has, though this time with Daida's body, Bojji's training under Despa has allowed him to become skilled in his own right through his superior agility and his talent for discovering an opponent's weak point, thus allowing him to triumph over his father. Secondly, we have the resolution to Miranjo's plot against the kingdom. After Bojji destroys the mirror, Miranjo's soul is collected by the same demon that granted Bosse his immense strength, but through Daida's empathy and compassion, her soul is rescued and returned to a living body. Daida announces that he forgives Miranjo for her misdeeds, with Bojji following suit, and that he plans to marry her in order to share the burden of her sins moving forward.    We'll start with that first climax, as it ties into what is easily this anime's strongest idea, that being the conflict between appearance and ability. With our main character, Bojji, being deaf and unable to verbally communicate with those around him, the topic of disability is centered at the forefront of Bojji's characterization and makes his life inordinately difficult. Other children laugh at him for his disability, while many of the adults find him frustrating to deal with, leaving Bojji with few people he can connect to. What's more, his disability often leads others to assume that he is of lesser skill or intelligence than those who are more able-bodied. One the one hand, this is true in terms of pure brute force, as it's revealed that his father, Bosse, made a deal with a demon that sapped Bojji of all his potential strength. As such, Bojji is looked down on by those who expect him to become a great king like his father despite his obvious physical disadvantage, asking something of him that he simply cannot give.    On the other hand, this disability also causes those around Bojji to perceive him as less intelligent, though this aspect of Bojji is an entirely false assumption. Because he often can't communicate what he wants in order to get his point across or just goes about life in ways that seem entirely foreign or nonsensical, those who observe Bojji simply attribute this to him being dumb, as it's easier to just write off his eccentricities as a part of his disability rather than try to understand him, thus adding to the issues that Bojji faces in both his social life and in his perception as a potential leader. Bojji is not mentally inept in any way. In fact, he often exhibits a keen sense of perception and intuition that vastly outpaces those around him, but because he has difficulties communicating these ideas to others, or more often so is unable to find people who will even try to understand to him, his reputation as a dunce becomes more pervasive despite his skills.    That said, even Bojji himself doesn't fully understand this concept until later on in the series. For at least the first couple episodes, Bojji and Kage are dead set on finding someone or some way to make Bojji physically stronger, as they too see Bosse as the ideal to be strived towards. This is readily apparent in how Bojji's more agile swordsmanship is bluntly rejected by the entire castle staff in favor of Daida's more straightforward and supposedly “honorable” style of fighting, and so Bojji and Kage seek out someone who can make him more adept with brute force. It isn't until both Desha and Despa lay it out plain as day that Bojji has zero potential for physical growth that they even attempt to find an alternative, and even that takes some persuasion on Despa's part. In this instance, even Bojji has gotten too wrapped up in his perception of himself and how he believes he should be viewed by others, rather than taking himself as he is and shaping his kingly identity around that.    Then we have Kage, our thief with a heart of gold. Kage is a descendant of the infamous shadow clan, a legendary group of assassins that had been purged some time before he appears on-screen. After losing his mother, Kage is treated with disdain by everyone around him, often as the result of his appearance, and ends up starving on the streets. Even after he finds somewhere to live, the person he lives with seems to hone in on Kage's heritage and starts using him to rob homes and other locations. Here, we have an instance that less appearance vs ability, but rather appearance vs personality. Kage doesn't want to be the bad guy, and we even see in a flashback that he saw his clan as good guys who loyally served their king, but the shady nature of their line of work causes people to constantly misread Kage's intentions, which we see with Bebin during the first few episodes. As such, Kage's experiences put him in the perfect position to understand Bojji. Though he too misinterprets Bojji's talents at first, he quickly comes around and is able to see all the good in him, and so makes it his goal to support Bojji in any way he can.    Finally, one of the more fascinating, yet somewhat understated examples of this contrasting of appearance against ability is presented through the brotherly relationship between Desha and Despa,  albeit in a much less clear-cut manner. Desha, the king of the Underworld, is portrayed to be much less attractive and amiable than his brother, and, according to Despa, he would occasionally get hung up on his own appearance, as displayed by him defacing his own monument. Despite this, Desha's supreme power and charisma allowed him to gain popularity and become a great king for his nation, freeing his people from the tyrannical rule of his father.    On the flip side of that, we have Despa, highly intelligent and incredibly handsome, yet lacking in the physical strength and extraordinary powers that his brother possesses, and much like Desha, he too envies that which his brother has that he does not, as shown in a flashback where Despa mourns his lack of physical prowess in comparison to his kin. Despite this, much like Desha, Despa eventually grows wise enough to recognize the usefulness of his own talents, shaping his persona and combat tendencies in ways that only he can and not simply trying to mimic his brother, a trait that he has endeavored to pass on to Bojji so that he too can carve out his own path without trying to follow in his father's footsteps or compete with Daida solely through strength. Bojji's incredible agility and insight into discovering an opponent's weakness is his greatest asset in combat and something he achieved precisely because of his disability, and Despa recognizes how wasteful it would be to squander that talent, thus allowing Bojji to overcome his lack of strength and stand on equal footing with Daida and Bosse.    This aspect of Bojji is symbolized perfectly by his choice of weapon, a small rapier given to him by Despa. While deciding on what weapon to train with, Bojji initially tries to use an axe, as it's the same weapon his father, who is portrayed as the ideal powerful king, uses on the battlefield, but even the smallest of axes proves too unwieldy. Thus, Bojji ultimately chooses the rapier, one that seems to have very little offensive power at all and tricks even Kage into thinking that it's worthless. Yet, Bojji is able to draw out the full potential of this weapon by using a fighting style best suited for him, one that emphasizes agility and small strikes over heavy hitting attacks. This allows Bojji to completely incapacite his opponents with no bloodshed, a perfect representation of Bojji's endless altruism towards even those who seek to harm him.

Bojji being deaf does not automatically make him lesser, but it does change the set of talents and ability preferences that he is endowed with, and so Bojji's arc is almost entirely one of internal growth and learning to see past the expectations of others in order to discover what will actually help him succeed, and this internal growth is also loosely tied to this anime's second major theme that becomes much more readily apparent in its second half: forgiveness.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

This Week in Games Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?  by Heidi Kemps, Apr 22nd 2022         Y'know, I really feel for the people who have been working for four-odd years on Digimon Survive. This week, we finally got a release date for this constantly-delayed, incredibly cursed game. Digimon Survive will end its arduous journey to retail shelves worldwide on July 29th.   BUT THEN! Just a few hours later, Nintendo decided to surprise-drop a trailer of their own, for the highly-anticipated Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Guess when that game's releasing?   Yeah, oof. The Digimon Survive team finally reaches the finish line, thinking that they'll have the quiet summer month of July to themselves on the release calendar… only to be violently shoved out of the spotlight by Nintendo, who are launching Xenoblade Chronicles 3 on the same damn day. That has to be soul-crushing. Speaking of Nintendo, we're going to be talking about them a fair bit this week! And also Sega! It'll be like gaming news in 1992, only with less in-your-face advertising and a lot more depressing stuff. NINTENDO DID NOT HAVE THE BEST WEEK Aside from “Surprise! Xenoblade!” the current news stories about Nintendo are not exactly great. For starters, it appears as though some in-development official Game Boy and Game Boy Advance emulators for the Switch leaked onto the internet. While there is an underground Switch homebrew scene that have been coding lots of stuff (including emulators), a lot of folks “in the know” about Nintendo's emulation development strongly believe that these leaked programs are the real deal.  The emulators, codenamed Sloop and Hiyoko, seem to bear the markings of NERD, the appropriately-acronymed programming team of Nintendo Europe Research and Development. NERD has done a lot of emulation-related work for both the Switch Online service and mini-consoles like the NES and SNES Mini, so them working on further console emulators makes sense. This leak may have tipped one of Nintendo's cards for the future of Switch Online, as the service does not yet support any Game Boy or GBA games. That wouldn't be a terribly surprising development, but Nintendo does not like reveals like this, especially when console hackery is involved. Anyhow, if you want to read more tech-y stuff about these two emulators speculating about their authenticity, here's a tweet thread for you. Have fun! Now for the less fun part: Nintendo's getting accused of union-busting.   NEWS: A worker says Nintendo of America violated their right to organize and has filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against them and a hiring firm Nintendo had largely avoided the industry's labor scandals, but an investigation will followhttps://t.co/nDaIEBY25B— Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) April 19, 2022    According to this report from veteran journalist Stephen Totilo, an anonymous worker who worked with one of Nintendo of America's contractors (Aston Carter) filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing both firms of violating their employees’ rights to form a union through “concerted activities” and “coercive actions.” While specifics about these allegations aren't known, they appear to have been serious enough to get the NLRB's attention. Regardless of whether or not Nintendo is engaging in union-busting activity, however, this story breaking drove quite a few former Nintendo fulltime and contract workers to talk publicly about their awful experiences there, corroborating claims of a hostile work environment.   As I'm no longer under their NDA anymore, I'll happily sing like a damn canary to anyone interested.And no, it's not just NOA. It's ALL Nintendo locations. Iwata himself frequently was there and saw this happening. We saw complaints from other locations constantly.— 🍄 An Artsy Greeble 🍄🔞 (@_katerwaul_) April 19, 2022      we may have know each other — I worked in the ptd for ~5 years before quitting towards the tail end of the wii u era. it's all true. shoutouts to mandatory two months unpaid time off every year, presumably to maintain contractor status and avoid giving us any benefits whatsoever— caznode (@iamNode) April 19, 2022    Nintendo has, thus far, managed to evade much of the scrutiny and ire rightfully pointed at major companies like Activision-Blizzard, EA, and Ubisoft – but if these reports and the complaint are any indication, the house of Mario is definitely not the fun-n-games workplace most folks imagine. Nintendo has responded to the initial article, though they're staying mum about the personal stories being shared on social media. Hopefully they'll address these allegations… but, sadly, I doubt it. Sigh. SEGA IS BRINGING BACK SONIC AND OTHER OLD FAVORITES… WITH CAVEATS Hey, remember when it was rumored that Sega wasn't speaking to the Sonic Mania development teams anymore? Yeah, well, it turns out that was a whole bunch of BS, because apparently many of those developers have been very busy working on a compilation package called Sonic Origins.   Sonic Origins contains all of the primary Genesis (and Sega-CD) Classic Sonic titles: Sonic 1, 2, Sonic 3 & Knuckles, and Sonic CD. These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably.

These aren't straight ROM-dump ports either, but remasters in line with 2011's multiplatform Sonic CD re-release and later mobile versions of Sonic 1 and 2, featuring widescreen support, graphical enhancements, and, in the case of Sonic 2, a completely remade Hidden Palace Zone stage that can be seen in the trailer above. You'll also be able to play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles across all of the games, and there will be new animated cutscenes, bonus challenges, galleries, sound players, all of that good stuff. Headcannon Studios, who was heavily involved in Sonic Mania, is leading up development on Sonic Origins. Additionally, longtime Sonic hacker and fangame developer Stealth confirmed their involvement in the game through some tweets. Notably, this is the first time since the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube generation that Sonic 3 & Knuckles is getting any sort of re-release. There has been speculation as to why Sonic 3 never got a remaster in the same vein as the other games – many folks believe that Michael Jackson and his producers were quietly involved with several of the games’ tracks, leading to legal issues in the current day. We'll have to see if those are all ironed out now, or if this version of S3&K will be using alternative tracks from the recently discovered Sonic 3 prototype. Anyhow, that's great news! Everyone loves classic Sonic! Except there's a catch: Sonic Origins has DLC. Very confusing DLC. And you might not get all of it even if you buy the premium-priced Digital Deluxe edition, either. Here's a not-so-handy chart breaking it down:  Yeah, way to screw up what should have been a guaranteed slam dunk there, Sega! I can't think of a game less suited to paid DLC than a Sonic compilation. But that's not all Sega may be looking to aggressively monetize… A report from Bloomberg is suggesting that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi reboots/revivals might be in the cards. That should be great news, because those games were beloved by every Dreamcast owner on planet Earth, right? Well, the headline should be enough to instill some serious dread: Sega Reboots Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio to Chase Fortnite Riches. Oh no. Ohhhhhh noooooooooooooooo   Yeah, remember that SUPER GAME initiative Sega's been talking about for a while? These reboots would be part of that program to “develop recurring revenue sources” and “build online communities around its software portfolio,” which is basically fancy corporate speak for “we're making these games LIVE SERVICE now!” Hot damn, I can't wait to gacha for Graffiti Souls and farm for part drops for my cab! Wait, no, I absolutely do not want to do that. Please stop. Unfortunately, game company executives only see massive success stories like Fortnite and not the many, many online and live-service failures. I was hoping that the disastrous launch of Babylon's Fall would make suits across the industry reconsider going all-in on live-service and microtransactions, but they're either too blind or they've already committed a ton of money to these projects and are trapped in the sunk-cost fallacy. But maybe the negative online reactions might spur some change. It worked for the Sonic movie, after all! (By the by, I recommend Nerdslayer Studios’ Death of a Game YouTube series to anyone interested in the hows and whys of online/live-service game failures. Watch a few of the vids and you'll be hooked.) ASSORTED NEWSBITS  Hey, remember when Electronic Arts cancelled former Naughty Dog scribe Amy Hennig's single-player Star Wars adventure game? They might be regretting that very soon, because…   I couldn't be more excited to be working on a new #StarWars game with @LucasfilmGames again for our second project @Skydance New Media!https://t.co/Ymd0xy8SRz— Amy Hennig (@amy_hennig) April 19, 2022    Owners of Guilty Gear Strive Season Pass 1 will be getting some new DLC next week in the form of “Another Story.” As the name implies, this is an additional story told from Ramlethal's perspective and features many characters not seen in the main GG Strive story while giving you more of that sweet, sweet LORE. In recent “Activision-Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick is a shitbag”-related news, there's a new piece on the Wall Street Journal discussing how a former flame of his – who worked in a prominent position at Facebook (now Meta) – pressured a tabloid to not publish a story that one of his exes had a restraining order against him. It seems like Bobby just attracts other awful people to him, like how Stand users somehow attract other Stand users to them in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.    Woof, kind of a not-great week, huh? I mean, yeah, Xenoblade 3, but a lot of the other Nintendo news tempers the excitement for that considerably. What are your thoughts on the various leaks, stories, and DLC-ridden mishaps this week has brought us? Please do drop by the forums linked below – I'd like to hear your takes on everything that's happening.

News PlayStation Plus Relaunches with New Features, Tiers on June 1 in Japan, June 13 in Americas, June 22 in Europe   posted on 2022-04-23 02:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan    Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) announced on Friday that it will launch previously announced new features and tiers for its PlayStation Plus service on May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan, June 1 in Japan, June 13 in the Americas, and June 22 in Europe.    In addition, cloud streaming access will be expanded to the following locations for a total of 30 markets with cloud streaming access: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    The new features will allow players to access modern titles through the subscription service, as well as catalog titles from past PlayStation platforms. PlayStation Plus will also merge with SIE's PlayStation Now subscription service (PlayStation Now will no longer be available as a standalone service after the features launch).    The additional features are consistent with a previous report by Bloomberg in December 2021 of Sony planning to launch a service codenamed ""Spartacus"" that would rival Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service.    The new features and subscription plan tiers for PlayStation Plus include:     PlayStation Plus Essential: this service remains the same as the current PlayStation Plus service and is priced the same.      PlayStation Plus Extra: this service has the features from the Essential tier, as well as access to ""up to 400"" PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that are downloadable to play.      PlayStation Plus Premium: this service has the features from the previous two tiers, as well as access to ""up to 340"" more games such as PlayStation 3 games for cloud streaming; PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games for download and/or streaming; the ability to stream games through PS4, PS5, and PC; and time-limited game trials on some games.    Players can pay for the subscription tiers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The Essential tier costs US$9.99 monthly, US$24.99 quarterly, or US$59.99 yearly. The Extra tier costs US$14.99 monthly, US$39.99 quarterly, or US$99.99 yearly. The Premium tier costs US$17.99 monthly, US$49.99 quarterly, or US$119.99 yearly.    Sony will offer markets without cloud streaming availability a separate third tier at a lower price that does not include any cloud streaming options.    PlayStation Plus is required for many online multiplayer games, and the service also offers several free games each month. PlayStation Now allows subscribers to stream or download older games.    Xbox Game Pass is a service that allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games without needing to individually purchase them. The service launched in June 2017, and is also available for PC.

News PlayStation Plus Relaunches with New Features, Tiers on June 1 in Japan, June 13 in Americas, June 22 in Europe   posted on 2022-04-23 02:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan    Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) announced on Friday that it will launch previously announced new features and tiers for its PlayStation Plus service on May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan, June 1 in Japan, June 13 in the Americas, and June 22 in Europe.    In addition, cloud streaming access will be expanded to the following locations for a total of 30 markets with cloud streaming access: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    The new features will allow players to access modern titles through the subscription service, as well as catalog titles from past PlayStation platforms. PlayStation Plus will also merge with SIE's PlayStation Now subscription service (PlayStation Now will no longer be available as a standalone service after the features launch).    The additional features are consistent with a previous report by Bloomberg in December 2021 of Sony planning to launch a service codenamed ""Spartacus"" that would rival Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service.    The new features and subscription plan tiers for PlayStation Plus include:     PlayStation Plus Essential: this service remains the same as the current PlayStation Plus service and is priced the same.      PlayStation Plus Extra: this service has the features from the Essential tier, as well as access to ""up to 400"" PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that are downloadable to play.      PlayStation Plus Premium: this service has the features from the previous two tiers, as well as access to ""up to 340"" more games such as PlayStation 3 games for cloud streaming; PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games for download and/or streaming; the ability to stream games through PS4, PS5, and PC; and time-limited game trials on some games.    Players can pay for the subscription tiers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The Essential tier costs US$9.99 monthly, US$24.99 quarterly, or US$59.99 yearly. The Extra tier costs US$14.99 monthly, US$39.99 quarterly, or US$99.99 yearly. The Premium tier costs US$17.99 monthly, US$49.99 quarterly, or US$119.99 yearly.    Sony will offer markets without cloud streaming availability a separate third tier at a lower price that does not include any cloud streaming options.    PlayStation Plus is required for many online multiplayer games, and the service also offers several free games each month. PlayStation Now allows subscribers to stream or download older games.    Xbox Game Pass is a service that allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games without needing to individually purchase them. The service launched in June 2017, and is also available for PC.

News PlayStation Plus Relaunches with New Features, Tiers on June 1 in Japan, June 13 in Americas, June 22 in Europe   posted on 2022-04-23 02:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan    Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) announced on Friday that it will launch previously announced new features and tiers for its PlayStation Plus service on May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan, June 1 in Japan, June 13 in the Americas, and June 22 in Europe.    In addition, cloud streaming access will be expanded to the following locations for a total of 30 markets with cloud streaming access: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    The new features will allow players to access modern titles through the subscription service, as well as catalog titles from past PlayStation platforms. PlayStation Plus will also merge with SIE's PlayStation Now subscription service (PlayStation Now will no longer be available as a standalone service after the features launch).    The additional features are consistent with a previous report by Bloomberg in December 2021 of Sony planning to launch a service codenamed ""Spartacus"" that would rival Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service.    The new features and subscription plan tiers for PlayStation Plus include:     PlayStation Plus Essential: this service remains the same as the current PlayStation Plus service and is priced the same.      PlayStation Plus Extra: this service has the features from the Essential tier, as well as access to ""up to 400"" PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that are downloadable to play.      PlayStation Plus Premium: this service has the features from the previous two tiers, as well as access to ""up to 340"" more games such as PlayStation 3 games for cloud streaming; PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games for download and/or streaming; the ability to stream games through PS4, PS5, and PC; and time-limited game trials on some games.    Players can pay for the subscription tiers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The Essential tier costs US$9.99 monthly, US$24.99 quarterly, or US$59.99 yearly. The Extra tier costs US$14.99 monthly, US$39.99 quarterly, or US$99.99 yearly. The Premium tier costs US$17.99 monthly, US$49.99 quarterly, or US$119.99 yearly.    Sony will offer markets without cloud streaming availability a separate third tier at a lower price that does not include any cloud streaming options.    PlayStation Plus is required for many online multiplayer games, and the service also offers several free games each month. PlayStation Now allows subscribers to stream or download older games.    Xbox Game Pass is a service that allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games without needing to individually purchase them. The service launched in June 2017, and is also available for PC.

Justin breaks down the grueling work of an anime producer. ―  Mikosh asked: I noticed that anime have different kinds of producers listed in their credits, like executive producers, producers, animation producers, etc. So what is the job of each one of them and in what way each producer impacts the pro...                           column          35 comments       Answerman - How Much Of The Doujinshi Scene Is Porn?   2019 Aug 15, 02:00 35 comments                 manga    Over 700,000 attendees visited Comiket this year, the mecca of self-published comics.

For starters, “lolicon” or “roricon” is short for “Lolita Complex.” “Lolita” as a term for an under-age girl comes from the book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov.

Justin looks back on old video rooms and industry panels to find out. ―  Fred asked: I've only been going to conventions for the past year or so, and I'm curious how they've evolved over time.

News Tatami Time Machine Blues Anime's Theatrical Screenings Start on September 30   posted on 2022-04-21 19:02 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Trailers for The Tatami Galaxy  sequel & In-Oh to air over next four weeks    The staff for the television anime of Tomihiko Morimi's Tatami Time Machine Blues (Yojō-Han Time Machine Blues) novel announced on Thursday that the anime's theatrical compilation film version will start its limited three-week run on September 30.        In addition, trailers (previewed in the visuals above) will air this month and next month during the ongoing rerun of The Tatami Galaxy television anime. The ""'Watashi' to Ozu no Eiga Yokoku"" (Ozu and I's Film Trailers) mini segments will debut footage from Tatami Time Machine Blues and also promote the INU-OH film's May 28 opening. The two Tatami Time Machine Blues trailers will air on April 28 and May 5, while the two INU-OH trailers will air on May 12 and May 19.    The lower-priced bunko edition of the Tatami Time Machine Blues novel will ship on June 10:          Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel to Morimi's earlier The Tatami Galaxy (Yojō-Han Shinwa Taikei) novel. It shipped in July 2020, 16 years after the original novel. The novel is inspired by Makoto Ueda's Summer Time Machine Blues stage play. Morimi wrote the novel, and Ueda, Morimi's friend, is credited with the original concept. The sequel novel combines elements of the stage play's story with the characters from Morimi's novel. Nakamura returned to illustrate the cover.    In the sequel novel's story, The Tatami Galaxy protagonist's trouble-making friend Ozu gets the student apartments' only air conditioner remote control wet, breaking it on a certain midsummer day. The students wonder what to do about the situation for the remainder of the summer and make a plan with Akashi. An unstylish male student from 25 years in the future arrives in a time machine. The protagonist travels back in time to try to retrieve the remote control before it is broken.    Most of the cast members are returning for the sequel anime, including Shintarō Asanuma as the protagonist ""I"" (Watashi), Maaya Sakamoto as Akashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu, Junichi Suwabe as Jōgasaki, and Yuko Kaida as Hanuki. Kazuya Nakai will voice Higuchi, replacing the character's original voice actor, the late Keiji Fujiwara.    Setsuji Satoh is returning from The Tatami Galaxy anime to reprise the role of Aijima, and Europe Kikaku's Chikara Honda is similarly reprising the Tamura-kun role from the Summer Time Machine Blues stage play and subsequent live-action film.    Shingo Natsume (One-Punch Man, Space Dandy, Sonny Boy) is directing the anime at Science SARU, and Makoto Ueda returns as scriptwriter from The Tatami Galaxy. Yūsuke Nakamura also returns as character designer.    The Walt Disney Company  will exclusively stream the new anime globally, including on the Disney+ service in Japan in 2022.  The Disney+ version will include an original episode that will not be shown in theaters.    Ohta Publishing released Morimi's original novel in 2005, with Nakamura illustrating the cover. The novel inspired an 11-episode anime by Masaaki Yuasa in April 2010.    HarperCollins' HarperVia imprint will publish The Tatami Galaxy novel in English in fall of 2022. The release will be followed with the sequel novel Tatami Time Machine Blues in summer of 2023. Emily Balistrieri is translating both novels. Balistrieri previously translated Morimi's The Night is Young, Walk on Girl novel, which inspired a 2017 anime film also directed by Masaaki Yuasa off a screenplay by Ueda.

News Tatami Time Machine Blues Anime's Theatrical Screenings Start on September 30   posted on 2022-04-21 19:02 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Trailers for The Tatami Galaxy  sequel & In-Oh to air over next four weeks    The staff for the television anime of Tomihiko Morimi's Tatami Time Machine Blues (Yojō-Han Time Machine Blues) novel announced on Thursday that the anime's theatrical compilation film version will start its limited three-week run on September 30.        In addition, trailers (previewed in the visuals above) will air this month and next month during the ongoing rerun of The Tatami Galaxy television anime. The ""'Watashi' to Ozu no Eiga Yokoku"" (Ozu and I's Film Trailers) mini segments will debut footage from Tatami Time Machine Blues and also promote the INU-OH film's May 28 opening. The two Tatami Time Machine Blues trailers will air on April 28 and May 5, while the two INU-OH trailers will air on May 12 and May 19.    The lower-priced bunko edition of the Tatami Time Machine Blues novel will ship on June 10:          Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel to Morimi's earlier The Tatami Galaxy (Yojō-Han Shinwa Taikei) novel. It shipped in July 2020, 16 years after the original novel. The novel is inspired by Makoto Ueda's Summer Time Machine Blues stage play. Morimi wrote the novel, and Ueda, Morimi's friend, is credited with the original concept. The sequel novel combines elements of the stage play's story with the characters from Morimi's novel. Nakamura returned to illustrate the cover.    In the sequel novel's story, The Tatami Galaxy protagonist's trouble-making friend Ozu gets the student apartments' only air conditioner remote control wet, breaking it on a certain midsummer day. The students wonder what to do about the situation for the remainder of the summer and make a plan with Akashi. An unstylish male student from 25 years in the future arrives in a time machine. The protagonist travels back in time to try to retrieve the remote control before it is broken.    Most of the cast members are returning for the sequel anime, including Shintarō Asanuma as the protagonist ""I"" (Watashi), Maaya Sakamoto as Akashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu, Junichi Suwabe as Jōgasaki, and Yuko Kaida as Hanuki. Kazuya Nakai will voice Higuchi, replacing the character's original voice actor, the late Keiji Fujiwara.    Setsuji Satoh is returning from The Tatami Galaxy anime to reprise the role of Aijima, and Europe Kikaku's Chikara Honda is similarly reprising the Tamura-kun role from the Summer Time Machine Blues stage play and subsequent live-action film.    Shingo Natsume (One-Punch Man, Space Dandy, Sonny Boy) is directing the anime at Science SARU, and Makoto Ueda returns as scriptwriter from The Tatami Galaxy. Yūsuke Nakamura also returns as character designer.    The Walt Disney Company  will exclusively stream the new anime globally, including on the Disney+ service in Japan in 2022.  The Disney+ version will include an original episode that will not be shown in theaters.    Ohta Publishing released Morimi's original novel in 2005, with Nakamura illustrating the cover. The novel inspired an 11-episode anime by Masaaki Yuasa in April 2010.    HarperCollins' HarperVia imprint will publish The Tatami Galaxy novel in English in fall of 2022. The release will be followed with the sequel novel Tatami Time Machine Blues in summer of 2023. Emily Balistrieri is translating both novels. Balistrieri previously translated Morimi's The Night is Young, Walk on Girl novel, which inspired a 2017 anime film also directed by Masaaki Yuasa off a screenplay by Ueda.

News Tatami Time Machine Blues Anime's Theatrical Screenings Start on September 30   posted on 2022-04-21 19:02 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Trailers for The Tatami Galaxy  sequel & In-Oh to air over next four weeks    The staff for the television anime of Tomihiko Morimi's Tatami Time Machine Blues (Yojō-Han Time Machine Blues) novel announced on Thursday that the anime's theatrical compilation film version will start its limited three-week run on September 30.        In addition, trailers (previewed in the visuals above) will air this month and next month during the ongoing rerun of The Tatami Galaxy television anime. The ""'Watashi' to Ozu no Eiga Yokoku"" (Ozu and I's Film Trailers) mini segments will debut footage from Tatami Time Machine Blues and also promote the INU-OH film's May 28 opening. The two Tatami Time Machine Blues trailers will air on April 28 and May 5, while the two INU-OH trailers will air on May 12 and May 19.    The lower-priced bunko edition of the Tatami Time Machine Blues novel will ship on June 10:          Tatami Time Machine Blues is a sequel to Morimi's earlier The Tatami Galaxy (Yojō-Han Shinwa Taikei) novel. It shipped in July 2020, 16 years after the original novel. The novel is inspired by Makoto Ueda's Summer Time Machine Blues stage play. Morimi wrote the novel, and Ueda, Morimi's friend, is credited with the original concept. The sequel novel combines elements of the stage play's story with the characters from Morimi's novel. Nakamura returned to illustrate the cover.    In the sequel novel's story, The Tatami Galaxy protagonist's trouble-making friend Ozu gets the student apartments' only air conditioner remote control wet, breaking it on a certain midsummer day. The students wonder what to do about the situation for the remainder of the summer and make a plan with Akashi. An unstylish male student from 25 years in the future arrives in a time machine. The protagonist travels back in time to try to retrieve the remote control before it is broken.    Most of the cast members are returning for the sequel anime, including Shintarō Asanuma as the protagonist ""I"" (Watashi), Maaya Sakamoto as Akashi, Hiroyuki Yoshino as Ozu, Junichi Suwabe as Jōgasaki, and Yuko Kaida as Hanuki. Kazuya Nakai will voice Higuchi, replacing the character's original voice actor, the late Keiji Fujiwara.    Setsuji Satoh is returning from The Tatami Galaxy anime to reprise the role of Aijima, and Europe Kikaku's Chikara Honda is similarly reprising the Tamura-kun role from the Summer Time Machine Blues stage play and subsequent live-action film.    Shingo Natsume (One-Punch Man, Space Dandy, Sonny Boy) is directing the anime at Science SARU, and Makoto Ueda returns as scriptwriter from The Tatami Galaxy. Yūsuke Nakamura also returns as character designer.    The Walt Disney Company  will exclusively stream the new anime globally, including on the Disney+ service in Japan in 2022.  The Disney+ version will include an original episode that will not be shown in theaters.    Ohta Publishing released Morimi's original novel in 2005, with Nakamura illustrating the cover. The novel inspired an 11-episode anime by Masaaki Yuasa in April 2010.    HarperCollins' HarperVia imprint will publish The Tatami Galaxy novel in English in fall of 2022. The release will be followed with the sequel novel Tatami Time Machine Blues in summer of 2023. Emily Balistrieri is translating both novels. Balistrieri previously translated Morimi's The Night is Young, Walk on Girl novel, which inspired a 2017 anime film also directed by Masaaki Yuasa off a screenplay by Ueda.
