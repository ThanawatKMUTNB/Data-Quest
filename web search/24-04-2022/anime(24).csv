Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

Episode 4  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Ya Boy Kongming! ?                     Community score: 4.4            Main characters of this thing that they are, a key element of Ya Boy Kongming! as it continues should be developing the relationship between Kongming and Eiko. Their meeting and connection to set up the basic gimmick of the show was kind of a funny little coincidence, strengthened by demonstrating the genuine effect Eiko's music had on Kongming. But since then, their roles in the portions of the story have felt oddly siloed, as Kongming clearly respects Eiko's talents and cares for her as a person, but doesn't really bring her into the strategies he's concocting around her career. Meanwhile, she has to simply curiously regard him on her own sidelines until each phase of his plans for her have their purposes become clear.    I understand the reasoning for this from a storytelling perspective: Part of the appeal of the series is that 'payoff' moment when we (along with other characters) suddenly have revealed to us what Kongming's big scheme in a given scenario was. But that could prove troublesome long-term, if the styling of Kongming's plans continuously relies on keeping Eiko in the dark to the point of her own consternation. With two big performance plans pulled off, this episode sets up a different, more long-term goal so it can turn around and specifically focus on detailing and deepening that dynamic between Kongming and Eiko, and to be honest, I don't know that I'm 100% sold on how the relationship is working at this point.    There were previously a couple…if we weren't being charitable we could call them 'excuses' in the writing for Kongming being opaque with Eiko regarding his plans. The main one was his point that he wanted to increase her confidence in her own performing skill, and letting her in on the complex logistics he was using to drive up engagement, still focused on her talents though that was, would undercut that. It made sense for the cases of drawing more audience members to her shows so she could bask in that attendant energy. Similarly, and he brings this point up again in this episode, Kongming simply wished for Eiko to concentrate on continuing to hone her musical ability, with the idea that paying attention to his organizational side might be no more than a distraction for her. Those explanations worked in the moment, but come off less applicable in the actions Kongming takes towards their goal in this episode.    Obviously we can guess just from the storytelling and style of the show that Kongming's regular partying excursions are part of an earnest effort at engagement in seeking the 100,000 Likes that Eiko needs to secure the spot at the next music festival they're shooting for. But him not even attempting to communicate that to her until she exasperatedly prompts him to can make their relationship come off as unnecessarily uneven. We definitely know that Kongming is a cool dude who's only doing his best for Eiko, but it feels like a little more specific clarification and communication might make that sort of endearment feel more genuine. Part of the idea with the presentation of this dynamic between the pair, which this episode makes clear is still very much growing and evolving at this point in the story, seems to be the idea that they're supposed to have faith in each other: That Kongming genuinely appreciates Eiko's musical ability and believes that it can deliver in whatever attention-grabbing setup he orchestrates to present it in, so she ought to, in kind, believe in his ability to concoct those setups. But it still comes off as lopsided, when the prompt by the end of this episode is that Eiko was holding out on Kongming in opening up about the specifics of her goals, her concerns about his efforts, and even her composition of a new song, but all that doesn't equate to Kongming opening up to her much beyond confirming that he will, in fact, come up with some sort of plan among all this.    I should confirm that, if I sound frustrated with the structure of the character connection in this one, that's mainly because the lack of a paid-off plan and the still-evolving presentation of the dynamic just means this episode comes off as less tight than the ones that preceded it. That well-orchestrated narrative satisfaction of seeing one of Kongming's wild strategies come together isn't here to carry things, so instead it's the meeting of our main characters' personalities that's doing the heavy lifting. To its credit, there's still enough there to make me feel like Eiko and Kongming are good kids deserving of our attention. The idea of observing Kongming from Eiko's point of view prompts a few more fun developments for him as a figure. I enjoy the implication that Kongming has just become a well-known fixture with the crowd of Shibuya at this point. And it's nice to see that his excursions result in Eiko realizing that she misses talking to him, winding up wondering about what this guy gets up to in his time off (which turns out to include stargazing, divination, and finding out where the cheap drinks in Roppongi are). That's the sort of grounded, personal interactions that help bring these two together to endear them to each other and the audience.    Similarly, whereas we got historical intersections with Kongming's backstory and what drove him last episode, this week we get to hear more details on Eiko's history, where connective issues between her parents and her music and how that led to her developing her confidence problems might be just a bit more relatable than Kongming's third-century military experiences. It's made clear how much Eiko really loves music, and that forms the sort of neat connection with Kongming that she should always have, since he loves her music just as much. This realizes that 'faith in each other' concept that's apparent as the idea of this episode, a demonstration of the 'water-fish fellowship' that Kongming likens their relationship to.    As I said, this storyline is clearly still in-progress by the time this episode finishes. And it does leave me curious as to where it will go, not just in terms of how Kongming will actually pull off nabbing those 100,000 likes, but also in if it will deliver on a more concrete definition of what Kongming and Eiko's relationship really is. Faith in each other's ability is important, but that might need to be reinforced with some more direct trust, and Kongming doing his goofy obtuse party-guy bit, while cute, obstructs the appeal of that trusting connection. For now, I'll try to have the same sort of faith in this series that Eiko and Kongming end up having in each other, but I still definitely want to see the complexities of that trust grow as it goes on.

And 2. the manga currently focuses on Aqua (the current MC), Kana and Akane but not Ruby, which she's supposed to be a female MC along with her brother Aqua. I feel like the manga is the Aqua, Kana and Akane show and the author dislikes Ruby, thus she gets Tenten-style treatment. There's even a ''Ruby who?'' jokes due to lack of Ruby's screentime, I think future anime only people will complain of Ruby's lack of screentime.

I feel like the manga is the Aqua, Kana and Akane show and the author dislikes Ruby, thus she's get Tenten-style treatment. There's even a joke of ''Ruby who?''. Future anime only people will be dissappointed and complaining of lack of screen time of Ruby.

It takes a while before you find out the true story, it would definitely need multiple cours and the latest plot twist shows there's more mystery to the story      Back to top                  Flü    Joined: 04 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 111       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 2:01 pm            It's beyond baffling that VIZ was dragging its feet so much on this series and never picked it up, despite it being a clear success for a long time now.  Even in Germany we already got 4 volumes out and English-speaking countries are only starting now. Good on Shueisha to finally force that issue now.  Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.

Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

I do think that it falls into the ""too weird for Viz"" category, Also while its not graphic, it touches on some very dark themes that can make alot of people uncomfortable (trigger warnings would be appropriate); I can see Viz taking a pass on it and someone like Seven Seas releasing the collected version.    That said, it really is Viz's loss.

Supposedly they will be doing 4 chapters a week, so if you miss just one week, you’ll be screwed since chapters will be gone forever and there’s no other legal access in English.

And 2. the manga currently focuses on Aqua (the current MC), Kana and Akane but not Ruby, which she's supposed to be a female MC along with her brother Aqua. I feel like the manga is the Aqua, Kana and Akane show and the author dislikes Ruby, thus she gets Tenten-style treatment. There's even a ''Ruby who?'' jokes due to lack of Ruby's screentime, I think future anime only people will complain of Ruby's lack of screentime.

It takes a while before you find out the true story, it would definitely need multiple cours and the latest plot twist shows there's more mystery to the story      Back to top                  Flü    Joined: 04 Oct 2014 		    Posts: 111       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 2:01 pm            It's beyond baffling that VIZ was dragging its feet so much on this series and never picked it up, despite it being a clear success for a long time now.  Even in Germany we already got 4 volumes out and English-speaking countries are only starting now. Good on Shueisha to finally force that issue now.

Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

I do think that it falls into the ""too weird for Viz"" category, Also while its not graphic, it touches on some very dark themes that can make alot of people uncomfortable (trigger warnings would be appropriate); I can see Viz taking a pass on it and someone like Seven Seas releasing the collected version.    That said, it really is Viz's loss.

Supposedly they will be doing 4 chapters a week, so if you miss just one week, you’ll be screwed since chapters will be gone forever and there’s no other legal access in English.

Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

Supposedly they will be doing 4 chapters a week, so if you miss just one week, you’ll be screwed since chapters will be gone forever and there’s no other legal access in English.

Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

I do think that it falls into the ""too weird for Viz"" category, Also while its not graphic, it touches on some very dark themes that can make alot of people uncomfortable (trigger warnings would be appropriate); I can see Viz taking a pass on it and someone like Seven Seas releasing the collected version.

Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

Even in Germany we already got 4 volumes out and English-speaking countries are only starting now. Good on Shueisha to finally force that issue now.  Translation also seems to be pretty decent so far.            It doesn't surprise me anymore.    Viz has proven to be risk adverse when they don't think a title will be successful for print. There have been several titles where they didn't quickly commit to a print license, waiting at least 12-18 months after its Japanese debut (act-age, Demon Slayer, Yozakura Family) or longer (Haikyu!). Even when the Jojo's Bizarre Adventure anime blew up, they waited quite a while before deciding to publish the Jojonium editions.   Not that being risk adverse isn't warranted or justified: a company needs to make profit, and there tends to be precedence (past sales numbers for older releases or similar titles) that supports these decisions, or lack thereof.   My guess is that Oshi no Ko is just ""weird"" enough for Viz to hesitate on licensing it. Hopefully enough people start reading it on MangaPlus so that they can have some hard data on views/clicks to push them to license it sooner, rather than later. Now that there's a legal avenue to read it + with their new policy of allowing one free read of each chapter, I'll finally be giving it a shot.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

News Sasaki and Miyano Anime's OVA Previewed in Video   posted on 2022-04-24 11:43 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's ""episode 13"" to ship with manga's 9th volume on July 27    Kadokawa began streaming a ""digest video"" on Friday for the upcoming OVA that will ship on DVD with the ninth volume of Shō Harusono's Sasaki and Miyano manga on July 27. Harusono drafted the original anime episode, titled ""Koi ni Kizuku Mae no Chotto Shita Hanashi."" The episode is considered the 13th episode of the television anime series.      The episode's story begins in November, when a student who lost a keychain goes to Miyano and the others. At Hanzawa's prompting, the ""First Lost-Item Detective Agency"" is established. Hirano's roommate Akira Kagiura appears in the episode, and Nobunaga Shimazaki reprises this role from an earlier drama CD.    The television anime premiered on January 9 and aired for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired and also streamed an English dub.    The staff of the anime announced in March that there would be a new anime in the franchise. The announcement was made after the original announcement for the OVA, which was announced in December.    Shinji Ishihira (Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, Talentless Nana) directed the television anime at Studio DEEN with Takahiro Ueno as the assistant director. Yoshiko Nakamura (Super Lovers, Shōnen Maid, Tada Never Falls in Love) was in charge of series scripts. Maki Fujii (I've Always Liked You, The Moment You Fall in Love, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) designed the characters.    Yen Press licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    It all started like a typical old-school boys' love plotline—bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys' love expert, he hasn't quite realized…he's in one himself. Which means it's up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!   Harusono launched the manga on the pixiv website in 2016.

News Sasaki and Miyano Anime's OVA Previewed in Video   posted on 2022-04-24 11:43 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's ""episode 13"" to ship with manga's 9th volume on July 27    Kadokawa began streaming a ""digest video"" on Friday for the upcoming OVA that will ship on DVD with the ninth volume of Shō Harusono's Sasaki and Miyano manga on July 27. Harusono drafted the original anime episode, titled ""Koi ni Kizuku Mae no Chotto Shita Hanashi."" The episode is considered the 13th episode of the television anime series.      The episode's story begins in November, when a student who lost a keychain goes to Miyano and the others. At Hanzawa's prompting, the ""First Lost-Item Detective Agency"" is established. Hirano's roommate Akira Kagiura appears in the episode, and Nobunaga Shimazaki reprises this role from an earlier drama CD.    The television anime premiered on January 9 and aired for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired and also streamed an English dub.    The staff of the anime announced in March that there would be a new anime in the franchise. The announcement was made after the original announcement for the OVA, which was announced in December.    Shinji Ishihira (Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, Talentless Nana) directed the television anime at Studio DEEN with Takahiro Ueno as the assistant director. Yoshiko Nakamura (Super Lovers, Shōnen Maid, Tada Never Falls in Love) was in charge of series scripts. Maki Fujii (I've Always Liked You, The Moment You Fall in Love, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) designed the characters.    Yen Press licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    It all started like a typical old-school boys' love plotline—bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys' love expert, he hasn't quite realized…he's in one himself. Which means it's up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!   Harusono launched the manga on the pixiv website in 2016.

News Sasaki and Miyano Anime's OVA Previewed in Video   posted on 2022-04-24 11:43 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime's ""episode 13"" to ship with manga's 9th volume on July 27    Kadokawa began streaming a ""digest video"" on Friday for the upcoming OVA that will ship on DVD with the ninth volume of Shō Harusono's Sasaki and Miyano manga on July 27. Harusono drafted the original anime episode, titled ""Koi ni Kizuku Mae no Chotto Shita Hanashi."" The episode is considered the 13th episode of the television anime series.      The episode's story begins in November, when a student who lost a keychain goes to Miyano and the others. At Hanzawa's prompting, the ""First Lost-Item Detective Agency"" is established. Hirano's roommate Akira Kagiura appears in the episode, and Nobunaga Shimazaki reprises this role from an earlier drama CD.    The television anime premiered on January 9 and aired for 12 episodes. Funimation streamed the anime as it aired and also streamed an English dub.    The staff of the anime announced in March that there would be a new anime in the franchise. The announcement was made after the original announcement for the OVA, which was announced in December.    Shinji Ishihira (Fairy Tail, Log Horizon, Talentless Nana) directed the television anime at Studio DEEN with Takahiro Ueno as the assistant director. Yoshiko Nakamura (Super Lovers, Shōnen Maid, Tada Never Falls in Love) was in charge of series scripts. Maki Fujii (I've Always Liked You, The Moment You Fall in Love, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart.) designed the characters.    Yen Press licensed the manga, and it describes the story:    It all started like a typical old-school boys' love plotline—bad-boy senior meets adorably awkward underclassman, one of them falls in love, and so on and so forth. But although Miyano is a self-proclaimed boys' love expert, he hasn't quite realized…he's in one himself. Which means it's up to Sasaki to make sure their story has a happily ever after…!

Interest Controversial Tawawa on Monday Manga Ad Sparks Conversation on Censorship   posted on 2022-04-21 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         Manga creator Ken Akamatsu, politician Kenzo Fujisue show support for manga series    One Japanese politician is making his opinion known following the controversy stemming from a full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga in The Nikkei financial newspaper. Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member Kenzo Fujisue shared an image of himself holding volumes three and four  Kiseki Himura's manga on Twitter on Tuesday. His tweet simply reads ""Purchased!""     買いました！#月曜日のたわわ pic.twitter.com/wigaUvc7iF— 参議院議員 ふじすえ健三（全国比例区）@4/29 福岡コミックライブ20 (@fujisue) April 20, 2022     Fujisue was elected to The Diet's House of Councillors in 2004 and participates in the government's Manga Council. He has spoken critically of the petition to amend the Child Prostitution and Child Pornography Prohibition Act to include guidelines to restrict depictions of underage characters, based on suggestions from the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.    The amendment would criminalize distribution, provision, sale, access, viewing and possession of images and depictions of children, or those who are primarily depicted as children, performing obvious sexual acts, or depictions of sexual parts of a child's body for sexual purposes. The petition also includes amendments targeting child prostitution, child pornography, services that promote sexual exploitation such as ""high school girl services,"" and child erotica.    Fujisue spoke about the petition and stated that these regulations would negatively affect manga culture and be difficult to enforce due to the subjectivity of what constitutes ""looking like a child"" while referencing the works of Osamu Tezuka.    ""I think it is also a problem that police resources are taken to crack down on victimless creations and do not contribute to saving real children,"" Fujisue wrote.    The Tawawa on Monday series also prompted comments from Love Hina manga creator and political hopeful Ken Akamatsu on Sunday. Akamatsu likened the criticism from the global gender equality organization UN Women as ""external pressure"" to regulate Japan's ""freedom of expression, especially for manga, anime, and games"" and that such pressure is not new. He elaborated that such regulations need to be approached with rationality and not be obeyed simply because an outside party is demanding it. Akamatsu's definition of ""external pressure"" does not necessarily mean ""outside Japan."" He used the removal of PSAs featuring Virtual YouTuber Tojou Linka as an example.    Chiba prefectural police removed a traffic PSA video featuring the YouTuber last year following a letter of complaint from the Alliance of Feminist Representatives (AFER). The lette criticized the VTuber's character design as ""sexually objectifying."" Akamatsu wrote that AFER referenced the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) reports published in 2016 as justification for the complaint.    Akamatsu disagrees with the statements in the CEDAW 2016 reports that claim that ""stereotypes continue to be the root cause of sexual violence against women, and pornography, anime, video games, and manga contribute to sexual violence against women and girls."" He states that there is no evidence that these forms of media actively contribute to violence and stereotypes against women and there is no outlined consensus on how to judge a work that meets these standards.    UN Women issued a letter to The Nikkei newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it. The ad showed main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" director of UN Women's Japan-based office Kae Ishikawa said.    Akamatsu wrote a post on April 16 and stated the regulations outlined in the Unstereotype Alliance have ""no rational basis.""    ""We creators cannot write or draw anything if there is a risk that the people who read it will reenact what happens in the story or creation. In reality, I have never heard of manga encouraging war or encouraging murder. Why is this irrational regulation so highly touted when it comes to manga depicting high school girls? I would like to see you provide rational reasons and scientific evidence,"" Akamatsu wrote. He stated that such regulations of advertisements violates the freedom of expression by the creators, publishers, and advertisers.

Interest Controversial Tawawa on Monday Manga Ad Sparks Conversation on Censorship   posted on 2022-04-21 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         Manga creator Ken Akamatsu, politician Kenzo Fujisue show support for manga series    One Japanese politician is making his opinion known following the controversy stemming from a full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga in The Nikkei financial newspaper. Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member Kenzo Fujisue shared an image of himself holding volumes three and four  Kiseki Himura's manga on Twitter on Tuesday. His tweet simply reads ""Purchased!""     買いました！#月曜日のたわわ pic.twitter.com/wigaUvc7iF— 参議院議員 ふじすえ健三（全国比例区）@4/29 福岡コミックライブ20 (@fujisue) April 20, 2022     Fujisue was elected to The Diet's House of Councillors in 2004 and participates in the government's Manga Council. He has spoken critically of the petition to amend the Child Prostitution and Child Pornography Prohibition Act to include guidelines to restrict depictions of underage characters, based on suggestions from the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.    The amendment would criminalize distribution, provision, sale, access, viewing and possession of images and depictions of children, or those who are primarily depicted as children, performing obvious sexual acts, or depictions of sexual parts of a child's body for sexual purposes. The petition also includes amendments targeting child prostitution, child pornography, services that promote sexual exploitation such as ""high school girl services,"" and child erotica.    Fujisue spoke about the petition and stated that these regulations would negatively affect manga culture and be difficult to enforce due to the subjectivity of what constitutes ""looking like a child"" while referencing the works of Osamu Tezuka.    ""I think it is also a problem that police resources are taken to crack down on victimless creations and do not contribute to saving real children,"" Fujisue wrote.    The Tawawa on Monday series also prompted comments from Love Hina manga creator and political hopeful Ken Akamatsu on Sunday. Akamatsu likened the criticism from the global gender equality organization UN Women as ""external pressure"" to regulate Japan's ""freedom of expression, especially for manga, anime, and games"" and that such pressure is not new. He elaborated that such regulations need to be approached with rationality and not be obeyed simply because an outside party is demanding it. Akamatsu's definition of ""external pressure"" does not necessarily mean ""outside Japan."" He used the removal of PSAs featuring Virtual YouTuber Tojou Linka as an example.    Chiba prefectural police removed a traffic PSA video featuring the YouTuber last year following a letter of complaint from the Alliance of Feminist Representatives (AFER). The lette criticized the VTuber's character design as ""sexually objectifying."" Akamatsu wrote that AFER referenced the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) reports published in 2016 as justification for the complaint.    Akamatsu disagrees with the statements in the CEDAW 2016 reports that claim that ""stereotypes continue to be the root cause of sexual violence against women, and pornography, anime, video games, and manga contribute to sexual violence against women and girls."" He states that there is no evidence that these forms of media actively contribute to violence and stereotypes against women and there is no outlined consensus on how to judge a work that meets these standards.    UN Women issued a letter to The Nikkei newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it. The ad showed main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" director of UN Women's Japan-based office Kae Ishikawa said.    Akamatsu wrote a post on April 16 and stated the regulations outlined in the Unstereotype Alliance have ""no rational basis.""    ""We creators cannot write or draw anything if there is a risk that the people who read it will reenact what happens in the story or creation. In reality, I have never heard of manga encouraging war or encouraging murder. Why is this irrational regulation so highly touted when it comes to manga depicting high school girls? I would like to see you provide rational reasons and scientific evidence,"" Akamatsu wrote. He stated that such regulations of advertisements violates the freedom of expression by the creators, publishers, and advertisers.

Interest Controversial Tawawa on Monday Manga Ad Sparks Conversation on Censorship   posted on 2022-04-21 02:45 UTC-8 by Lynzee Loveridge         Manga creator Ken Akamatsu, politician Kenzo Fujisue show support for manga series    One Japanese politician is making his opinion known following the controversy stemming from a full-page ad for the Tawawa on Monday (Getsuyōbi no Tawawa) fanservice manga in The Nikkei financial newspaper. Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member Kenzo Fujisue shared an image of himself holding volumes three and four  Kiseki Himura's manga on Twitter on Tuesday. His tweet simply reads ""Purchased!""     買いました！#月曜日のたわわ pic.twitter.com/wigaUvc7iF— 参議院議員 ふじすえ健三（全国比例区）@4/29 福岡コミックライブ20 (@fujisue) April 20, 2022     Fujisue was elected to The Diet's House of Councillors in 2004 and participates in the government's Manga Council. He has spoken critically of the petition to amend the Child Prostitution and Child Pornography Prohibition Act to include guidelines to restrict depictions of underage characters, based on suggestions from the Global Partnership to End Violence Against Children and the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.    The amendment would criminalize distribution, provision, sale, access, viewing and possession of images and depictions of children, or those who are primarily depicted as children, performing obvious sexual acts, or depictions of sexual parts of a child's body for sexual purposes. The petition also includes amendments targeting child prostitution, child pornography, services that promote sexual exploitation such as ""high school girl services,"" and child erotica.    Fujisue spoke about the petition and stated that these regulations would negatively affect manga culture and be difficult to enforce due to the subjectivity of what constitutes ""looking like a child"" while referencing the works of Osamu Tezuka.    ""I think it is also a problem that police resources are taken to crack down on victimless creations and do not contribute to saving real children,"" Fujisue wrote.    The Tawawa on Monday series also prompted comments from Love Hina manga creator and political hopeful Ken Akamatsu on Sunday. Akamatsu likened the criticism from the global gender equality organization UN Women as ""external pressure"" to regulate Japan's ""freedom of expression, especially for manga, anime, and games"" and that such pressure is not new. He elaborated that such regulations need to be approached with rationality and not be obeyed simply because an outside party is demanding it. Akamatsu's definition of ""external pressure"" does not necessarily mean ""outside Japan."" He used the removal of PSAs featuring Virtual YouTuber Tojou Linka as an example.    Chiba prefectural police removed a traffic PSA video featuring the YouTuber last year following a letter of complaint from the Alliance of Feminist Representatives (AFER). The lette criticized the VTuber's character design as ""sexually objectifying."" Akamatsu wrote that AFER referenced the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) reports published in 2016 as justification for the complaint.    Akamatsu disagrees with the statements in the CEDAW 2016 reports that claim that ""stereotypes continue to be the root cause of sexual violence against women, and pornography, anime, video games, and manga contribute to sexual violence against women and girls."" He states that there is no evidence that these forms of media actively contribute to violence and stereotypes against women and there is no outlined consensus on how to judge a work that meets these standards.    UN Women issued a letter to The Nikkei newspaper on April 11 stating that the advertisement is ""unacceptable"" and asked for further clarification about the choice to print it. The ad showed main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" director of UN Women's Japan-based office Kae Ishikawa said.    Akamatsu wrote a post on April 16 and stated the regulations outlined in the Unstereotype Alliance have ""no rational basis.""    ""We creators cannot write or draw anything if there is a risk that the people who read it will reenact what happens in the story or creation. In reality, I have never heard of manga encouraging war or encouraging murder. Why is this irrational regulation so highly touted when it comes to manga depicting high school girls? I would like to see you provide rational reasons and scientific evidence,"" Akamatsu wrote. He stated that such regulations of advertisements violates the freedom of expression by the creators, publishers, and advertisers.

The ad showed main character Ai standing in profile in her school uniform. The text reads, ""I hope this will be a wonderful week."" Kodansha placed the ad to promote the release of the manga's fourth volume.    The manga series began in 2015 as weekly pin-ups posted on artist Kiseki Himura's Twitter account. The main character, Ai, is a high school girl with large breasts who encounters a businessman on the train ride to school. The girl's regular appearance on the train brightens up the man's gloomy Monday commute.    The Nikkei paper is part of UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance effort, a global campaign to promote ""gender equality through media and advertising and eliminate harmful stereotypes."" The Nikkei paper has taken an active role in promoting the initiative's ideas in the past, including the ""Nikkei Woman Empowerment Advertising Award,"" which recognizes advertisements that contribute to gender equality. The award has a three-step process for screening ads known as ""The 3 Ps"" - Presence (does the ad include diverse people?), Perspective (does it take the perspectives of both men and women into account?), and Personality (does the subject show personality and independence?).    ""Without an explanation from the company, I am not convinced that we will continue to work with them to promote gender equality through the power of advertising,"" director of UN Women's Japan-based office Kae Ishikawa said.    Akamatsu wrote a post on April 16 and stated the regulations outlined in the Unstereotype Alliance have ""no rational basis.""    ""We creators cannot write or draw anything if there is a risk that the people who read it will reenact what happens in the story or creation. In reality, I have never heard of manga encouraging war or encouraging murder. Why is this irrational regulation so highly touted when it comes to manga depicting high school girls? I would like to see you provide rational reasons and scientific evidence,"" Akamatsu wrote. He stated that such regulations of advertisements violates the freedom of expression by the creators, publishers, and advertisers.

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

One Piece Episode 1014  by Grant Jones, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1014 of One Piece ?                     Community score: 4.4            After many long weeks, One Piece is back. What a glorious day.    This episode is a solid return to form for the consistently strong Wano arc. There are plenty of fight scenes and more than a few flashbacks, and it all fits together well without feeling overwhelming. There's no big standout moment, but being consistent and, well, back is sufficient enough.    There are lots of fun little moments in this episode as well, such as scenes of Chopper demonstrating battlefield medical science – it's rare that he gets any screen time, let alone showcase his medical background. We also get lots of Marco showing off his blazing pineapple powers which I know will please the Marco lovers out there.    But the real meat of the episode is a rumination on what Wano means to Ace, and what Ace means to Wano. Ace's place in One Piece is interesting because his demise is one of the few high-profile character deaths in the entirety of its 25-year run. It was definitely one of the definitive moments of the series and I still get pangs in my chest (sorry, too soon) just thinking about him. So it's interesting that Oda has chosen to tie Wano into his past through flashbacks as a way to loop it more fully into Luffy's personal story.    Oda is a huge proponent of hard-hitting flashbacks, but I think using Ace this way is smart. Because we so rarely get much information about Ace, having his dream be tied to Wano gives us that much more reason to root for Luffy's success. The flashbacks to Yamato and Tama spending time with Ace further underscores how important they are, while adding a bit of gravitas to their relatively recent appearances in the story.    There are a few bombastic fight sequences to round out the episode too. Queen and King make their “official” combat debuts against Marco, plus we get some really terrific Musou-esque explosions of goons when Luffy comes in swinging right at the end. All in all a great episode that hopefully heralds a return to regular airing for the show.    Rating:                 Grant is the cohost on the  Blade Licking Thieves podcast and Super Senpai Podcast.  One Piece is currently streaming on Crunchyroll and Funimation.com.    <prevEpisode 696 Episode 697 Episode 698 Episode 699 Episode 700 Episode 701 Episode 702 Episode 703 Episode 704 Episode 705 Episode 706 Episode 707 Episode 708 Episode 709 Episode 710 Episode 711 Episode 712 Episode 713 Episode 714 Episode 715 Episode 716 Episode 717-718 Episode 719 Episode 720 Episode 721 Episode 722 Episode 723 Episode 724 Episode 725 Episode 726 Episode 727 Episode 728 Episode 729 Episode 730 Episode 731 Episode 732 Episode 733 Episode 734 Episode 735 Episode 736 Episode 737 Episode 738 Episode 739 Episode 740 Episode 741 Episode 742 Episode 743 Episode 744 Episode 745 Episode 746 Episode 747 Episode 748 Episode 749 Episode 750 Episode 751 Episode 752 Episode 753 Episode 754 Episode 755 Episode 756 Episode 757 Episode 758 Episode 759 Episode 760 Episode 761 Episode 762 Episode 763 Episode 764 Episode 765 Episode 766 Episode 767 Episode 768 Episode 769 Episode 770 Episode 771 Episode 772 Episode 773 Episode 774 Episode 775 Episode 776 Episode 777 Episode 778 Episode 779 Episode 780 Episode 781 Episode 782 Episode 783 Episode 784 Episode 785 Episode 786 Episode 787 Episode 788 Episode 789 Episode 790 Episode 791 Episode 792 Episode 793 Episode 794 Episode 795 Episode 796 Episode 797 Episode 798 Episode 799 Episode 800 Episode 801 Episode 802 Episode 803 Episode 804 Episode 805 Episode 806 Episodes 807-808 Episode 809 Episode 810 Episode 811 Episode 812 Episode 813 Episode 814 Episode 815 Episode 816 Episode 817 Episode 818 Episode 819 Episode 820 Episode 821 Episode 822 Episode 823 Episode 824 Episode 825 Episode 826 Episode 827 Episode 828 Episode 829 Episode 830 Episode 831 Episode 832 Episode 833 Episode 834 Episode 835 Episode 836 Episode 837 Episode 838 Episode 839 Episode 840 Episode 841 Episode 842 Episode 843 Episode 844 Episode 845 Episode 846 Episode 847 Episode 848 Episode 849 Episode 850 Episode 851 Episode 852 Episode 853 Episode 854 Episode 855 Episode 856 Episode 857 Episode 858 Episode 859 Episode 860 Episode 861 Episode 862 Episode 863 Episode 864 Episode 865 Episode 866 Episode 867 Episode 868 Episode 869 Episode 870 Episode 871 Episode 872 Episode 873 Episode 874 Episode 875 Episode 876 Episode 877 Episode 878 Episode 879 Episode 880 Episodes 881-882 Episode 883 Episodes 884-885 Episode 886 Episode 887 Episode 888 Episode 889 Episode 890 Episode 891 Episode 892 Episode 893 Episode 894 Episode 895 Episode 896 Episode 897 Episode 898 Episode 899 Episode 900 Episode 901 Episode 902 Episode 903 Episode 904 Episode 905 Episodes 907-908 Episode 909 Episode 910 Episodes 911-912 Episodes 913-915 Episodes 916-918 Episodes 919-921 Episodes 922-924 Episodes 925-927 Episodes 928-930 Episodes 931-933 Episodes 934-935 Episode 936 Episode 937 Episode 938 Episode 939 Episode 940 Episode 941 Episode 942 Episode 943 Episode 944 Episode 945 Episode 946 Episode 947 Episode 948 Episode 949 Episode 950 Episode 951 Episode 952 Episode 953 Episode 954 Episode 955 Episode 956 Episode 957 Episode 958 Episode 959 Episode 960 Episode 961 Episode 962 Episode 963 Episode 964 Episode 965 Episode 966 Episode 967 Episode 968 Episode 969 Episode 970 Episode 971 Episode 972 Episode 973 Episode 974 Episode 975 Episode 976 Episode 977 Episode 978 Episode 979 Episode 980 Episodes 981-982 Episode 983 Episode 984 Episode 985 Episode 986 Episode 987 Episode 988 Episode 989 Episode 990 Episode 991 Episode 992 Episode 993 Episode 994 Episode 995 Episode 996 Episode 997 Episode 998 Episode 999 Episode 1000 Episode 1001 Episode 1002 Episode 1003 Episode 1004 Episode 1005 Episode 1006 Episode 1007 Episode 1008 Episode 1009 Episode 1010 Episode 1011 Episode 1012 Episode 1013 Episode 1014     discuss this in the forum (621 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to One Piece Episode Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

REVIEW: The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        casenumber00    Joined: 05 Feb 2011 		    Posts: 126       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:57 pm            Watching S1, I realized this anime had a pretty deep story and even deeper lore. Even being up to date on the manga, and it has gotten deeper. It's very surprising since the author puts the comedy moments before the story, so much so that you can zone out for 2 seconds and miss a plot point delivered off handedly that will come up later. For that, the author is very deliberate where is seemed like something said was made out to be a joke or a character's actions and behaviors seem comedic, those things have meaning in the story. Also the manga and franchise seems to be popular in Japan, a quick look on 2ch and all the fan art on pixiv can attest to that.

Yes, one of my favorite things about Demon Girl Next Door is its ability to coat its not-so-bright character backstories and certain situations with a perfect mix of banter, naivety, and youthful exuberance that it never really weighs too heavily on the show. It reminds me of Mahoraba ~Heartful~ Days which also had a similar ability. I'm kind of miffed a little that the OP has spoiled some pretty memorable moments, but I guess there's sometimes no getting around that. Otherwise, I've been super happy with 2nd season thus far.

(This is one of the very rare cases where a first season didn't get episode reviews but a second or later season is, which I see as a testament to the first season's unexpected quality.) Definitely agree that there's a lot more story to this one than is apparent up front. You also have to pay attention even to backgrounds to catch all of the jokes, as occasionally some of them aren't in the foreground.

I hope we can get some TWIA or something for the first season to interest people who missed it into catching up on it and continuing the second, like some people decided to try Estab-Life after it was featured.  I wrote it in review schedule thread, but another former reviewer beside Key also found this show very good, so together with James' very enthusiastic reaction, it should be clear this is a show that can quickly charm everyone.

It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe???            There is actually a reason why she is clueless about standard things and not simply her being cute and funny for the sake of it.    spoiler[As you may recall from the last 2 episodes from S1, it was revealed that Shamiko was hospitalized, like coma level bad, for a long time so she never got to experience a lot of life events one would go through.

It's getting increasingly more difficult these days for me to believe that any Zoomer living in a tech-savvy society would be so utterly baffled by the most basic of technological concepts, especially when it comes to social media, no matter how cosmically impoverished they may be. Is Shamiko's cluelessness a character cliché that might not totally work here in the 2020s, or is it a clue that has larger implications about the differences between our world and this magic-infused alternate universe???            There is actually a reason why she is clueless about standard things and not simply her being cute and funny for the sake of it.    spoiler[As you may recall from the last 2 episodes from S1, it was revealed that Shamiko was hospitalized, like coma level bad, for a long time so she never got to experience a lot of life events one would go through.

Just in and out of the hospital and potentially lethally so around Christmas at age 6. After that incident (Which I won't even mention more about here in a spoiler tag just in case) by all accounts she essentially became that trope of ""girl in class who only shows up half the time and is sick in bed the other half."" ] Personally I'm content with the ""extremely poor family"" explanation, but spoiler[being so focused on just staying alive] is also a factor.   With that out of the way, really glad more people are being made aware of this gem. It's legitimately the best series to come out of a Kirara magazine since Yuru-camp (Which the author has made comparisons to in interviews about Yuru-camp showing people remaining connected over distances and in remote places through technology and wanting to somewhat flip that with MahiMazo being about very geographically close people having no communication or openness and having them slowly open up to each other as they connect) and this comes from a massive fan of SoL series.

Even being up to date on the manga, and it has gotten deeper. It's very surprising since the author puts the comedy moments before the story, so much so that you can zone out for 2 seconds and miss a plot point delivered off handedly that will come up later. For that, the author is very deliberate where is seemed like something said was made out to be a joke or a character's actions and behaviors seem comedic, those things have meaning in the story. Also the manga and franchise seems to be popular in Japan, a quick look on 2ch and all the fan art on pixiv can attest to that.

Yes, one of my favorite things about Demon Girl Next Door is its ability to coat its not-so-bright character backstories and certain situations with a perfect mix of banter, naivety, and youthful exuberance that it never really weighs too heavily on the show. It reminds me of Mahoraba ~Heartful~ Days which also had a similar ability. I'm kind of miffed a little that the OP has spoiled some pretty memorable moments, but I guess there's sometimes no getting around that. Otherwise, I've been super happy with 2nd season thus far.

(This is one of the very rare cases where a first season didn't get episode reviews but a second or later season is, which I see as a testament to the first season's unexpected quality.) Definitely agree that there's a lot more story to this one than is apparent up front. You also have to pay attention even to backgrounds to catch all of the jokes, as occasionally some of them aren't in the foreground.

I hope we can get some TWIA or something for the first season to interest people who missed it into catching up on it and continuing the second, like some people decided to try Estab-Life after it was featured.  I wrote it in review schedule thread, but another former reviewer beside Key also found this show very good, so together with James' very enthusiastic reaction, it should be clear this is a show that can quickly charm everyone.

After that incident (Which I won't even mention more about here in a spoiler tag just in case) by all accounts she essentially became that trope of ""girl in class who only shows up half the time and is sick in bed the other half."" ] Personally I'm content with the ""extremely poor family"" explanation, but spoiler[being so focused on just staying alive] is also a factor.   With that out of the way, really glad more people are being made aware of this gem. It's legitimately the best series to come out of a Kirara magazine since Yuru-camp (Which the author has made comparisons to in interviews about Yuru-camp showing people remaining connected over distances and in remote places through technology and wanting to somewhat flip that with MahiMazo being about very geographically close people having no communication or openness and having them slowly open up to each other as they connect) and this comes from a massive fan of SoL series.

REVIEW: The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        casenumber00    Joined: 05 Feb 2011 		    Posts: 126       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:57 pm            Watching S1, I realized this anime had a pretty deep story and even deeper lore. Even being up to date on the manga, and it has gotten deeper. It's very surprising since the author puts the comedy moments before the story, so much so that you can zone out for 2 seconds and miss a plot point delivered off handedly that will come up later. For that, the author is very deliberate where is seemed like something said was made out to be a joke or a character's actions and behaviors seem comedic, those things have meaning in the story. Also the manga and franchise seems to be popular in Japan, a quick look on 2ch and all the fan art on pixiv can attest to that.

Yes, one of my favorite things about Demon Girl Next Door is its ability to coat its not-so-bright character backstories and certain situations with a perfect mix of banter, naivety, and youthful exuberance that it never really weighs too heavily on the show. It reminds me of Mahoraba ~Heartful~ Days which also had a similar ability. I'm kind of miffed a little that the OP has spoiled some pretty memorable moments, but I guess there's sometimes no getting around that. Otherwise, I've been super happy with 2nd season thus far.

(This is one of the very rare cases where a first season didn't get episode reviews but a second or later season is, which I see as a testament to the first season's unexpected quality.) Definitely agree that there's a lot more story to this one than is apparent up front. You also have to pay attention even to backgrounds to catch all of the jokes, as occasionally some of them aren't in the foreground.

I hope we can get some TWIA or something for the first season to interest people who missed it into catching up on it and continuing the second, like some people decided to try Estab-Life after it was featured.  I wrote it in review schedule thread, but another former reviewer beside Key also found this show very good, so together with James' very enthusiastic reaction, it should be clear this is a show that can quickly charm everyone.

REVIEW: The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        casenumber00    Joined: 05 Feb 2011 		    Posts: 126       Posted: Mon Apr 18, 2022 11:57 pm            Watching S1, I realized this anime had a pretty deep story and even deeper lore. Even being up to date on the manga, and it has gotten deeper. It's very surprising since the author puts the comedy moments before the story, so much so that you can zone out for 2 seconds and miss a plot point delivered off handedly that will come up later. For that, the author is very deliberate where is seemed like something said was made out to be a joke or a character's actions and behaviors seem comedic, those things have meaning in the story. Also the manga and franchise seems to be popular in Japan, a quick look on 2ch and all the fan art on pixiv can attest to that.

Yes, one of my favorite things about Demon Girl Next Door is its ability to coat its not-so-bright character backstories and certain situations with a perfect mix of banter, naivety, and youthful exuberance that it never really weighs too heavily on the show. It reminds me of Mahoraba ~Heartful~ Days which also had a similar ability. I'm kind of miffed a little that the OP has spoiled some pretty memorable moments, but I guess there's sometimes no getting around that. Otherwise, I've been super happy with 2nd season thus far.

(This is one of the very rare cases where a first season didn't get episode reviews but a second or later season is, which I see as a testament to the first season's unexpected quality.) Definitely agree that there's a lot more story to this one than is apparent up front. You also have to pay attention even to backgrounds to catch all of the jokes, as occasionally some of them aren't in the foreground.

I hope we can get some TWIA or something for the first season to interest people who missed it into catching up on it and continuing the second, like some people decided to try Estab-Life after it was featured.  I wrote it in review schedule thread, but another former reviewer beside Key also found this show very good, so together with James' very enthusiastic reaction, it should be clear this is a show that can quickly charm everyone.

It's actually one of the more believable reasons why she is clueless in this day and age along with her family being impoverished. Again, its one of those subtle ways that the author masks and hides vital plot points in seemingly stand alone jokes.

Just in and out of the hospital and potentially lethally so around Christmas at age 6. After that incident (Which I won't even mention more about here in a spoiler tag just in case) by all accounts she essentially became that trope of ""girl in class who only shows up half the time and is sick in bed the other half."" ] Personally I'm content with the ""extremely poor family"" explanation, but spoiler[being so focused on just staying alive] is also a factor.   With that out of the way, really glad more people are being made aware of this gem. It's legitimately the best series to come out of a Kirara magazine since Yuru-camp (Which the author has made comparisons to in interviews about Yuru-camp showing people remaining connected over distances and in remote places through technology and wanting to somewhat flip that with MahiMazo being about very geographically close people having no communication or openness and having them slowly open up to each other as they connect) and this comes from a massive fan of SoL series.

Even being up to date on the manga, and it has gotten deeper. It's very surprising since the author puts the comedy moments before the story, so much so that you can zone out for 2 seconds and miss a plot point delivered off handedly that will come up later. For that, the author is very deliberate where is seemed like something said was made out to be a joke or a character's actions and behaviors seem comedic, those things have meaning in the story. Also the manga and franchise seems to be popular in Japan, a quick look on 2ch and all the fan art on pixiv can attest to that.

Yes, one of my favorite things about Demon Girl Next Door is its ability to coat its not-so-bright character backstories and certain situations with a perfect mix of banter, naivety, and youthful exuberance that it never really weighs too heavily on the show. It reminds me of Mahoraba ~Heartful~ Days which also had a similar ability.

Even being up to date on the manga, and it has gotten deeper. It's very surprising since the author puts the comedy moments before the story, so much so that you can zone out for 2 seconds and miss a plot point delivered off handedly that will come up later. For that, the author is very deliberate where is seemed like something said was made out to be a joke or a character's actions and behaviors seem comedic, those things have meaning in the story. Also the manga and franchise seems to be popular in Japan, a quick look on 2ch and all the fan art on pixiv can attest to that.

Yes, one of my favorite things about Demon Girl Next Door is its ability to coat its not-so-bright character backstories and certain situations with a perfect mix of banter, naivety, and youthful exuberance that it never really weighs too heavily on the show. It reminds me of Mahoraba ~Heartful~ Days which also had a similar ability. I'm kind of miffed a little that the OP has spoiled some pretty memorable moments, but I guess there's sometimes no getting around that. Otherwise, I've been super happy with 2nd season thus far.

Home Anime Noir is a Great Female-Led Assassin Anime For Viewers Let Down by Love of Kill    Noir is a Great Female-Led Assassin Anime For Viewers Let Down by Love of Kill  By Molly Kishikawa Published 10 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Noir shows that it's possible to have accomplished female assassins without falling into the damsel-in-distress role.                  Many fans of Love of Kill have been feeling let down by its main protagonist, Chateau Dankworth. Chateau is a bounty hunter recently recruited by Ritzland Support, but despite this, she frequently needs to be saved by Song Ryang-ha, a professional hitman. Despite her profession being one that requires a lot of skill to perform, some viewers felt that she doesn't meet the qualifications one would need. She feels more like a damsel in distress than a bounty hunter. This is where 2001's Noir comes in.  The story of Noir follows Japanese high school student Kirika Yuumura as she tries to regain her lost memories with the help of Mireille Bouquet, a professional assassin. After the two meet, they are led to believe they have little to no connection with each other. However, they slowly learn that their pasts intertwine more than they realize. Both were chosen by Les Soldats, a secret society that believes the girls will become Noir -- a pair of female assassins who are harbingers of death. As a child, Kirika was trained by Les Soldats to be an efficient assassin, killing both of Mireille's parents at age eight. When she was 15, she was sent to Japan, but lost her memories in an unknown event.  RELATED: Spy x Family: Loid Proposes to [SPOILER] in the Most Iconic Way to Complete the Family                 Mireille is Kirika's Corsican partner and one of the most accomplished assassins for hire. After being lured to Japan by an email sent by Kirika, the two are attacked by a group of men firing guns at them. Mireille is held at gunpoint, but Kirika returns and saves her. After tending to Mireille's injuries, she agrees to help Kirika regain her memories, and the two begin living together in Paris. As the two begin working together on missions, Mireille becomes more and more aware of Kirika's assassination skill, despite both being under the impression that she was just a high school student. The two slowly become closer the more they work together, despite Mireille's attempts to keep Kirika at a distance. Over the course of the series, the two meet people who they are unsure if they can trust, knowing that anyone could be part of the group that's after them.  The series was created and written by Ryoe Tsukimura in 2001. Spanning 26 episodes, it was produced by Victor Entertainment and Bee Train and featured character designs by Yoko Kikuchi, Minako Shiba and Satoko Miyachi. The show aired on TV Tokyo from April to September before being released on DVD, and it was distributed in North America by Funimation. RELATED: Heroines Run the Show Takes Idol Anime in a New Direction                 Where Love of Kill falls flat, Noir excels, as both Kirika and Mireille are capable killers. Despite her young age, Kirika is able to take out multiple people, sometimes at the same time, without issue, while Chateau struggles to complete her missions at several points. Even if she is new to bounty hunting, she had to have training at some point. Having someone brand-new go out on missions by herself without training not only puts the hire in danger but also the people around her, as well as her company.  Kirika and Mireille live up to the idea that they are candidates for being Noir. Even before meeting Kirika, Mireille is said to be the best in her field. Kirika was trained from a young age to be a killer, and having her instincts remain intact after losing her memories solidifies this. She's able to adapt to most situations quickly, and even if she runs into trouble, Mireille is able to pick up where Kirika left off. These two are excellent examples of female assassins who are actually good at their jobs.

24-04-2022,anime,4,0,https://www.cbr.com/noir-female-assassin-anime/,Noir is a Great Female-Led Assassin Anime,"      Home Anime Noir is a Great Female-Led Assassin Anime For Viewers Let Down by Love of Kill    Noir is a Great Female-Led Assassin Anime For Viewers Let Down by Love of Kill  By Molly Kishikawa Published 10 hours ago     Share    Share    Tweet    Share    Email   Noir shows that it's possible to have accomplished female assassins without falling into the damsel-in-distress role.                  Many fans of Love of Kill have been feeling let down by its main protagonist, Chateau Dankworth. Chateau is a bounty hunter recently recruited by Ritzland Support, but despite this, she frequently needs to be saved by Song Ryang-ha, a professional hitman. Despite her profession being one that requires a lot of skill to perform, some viewers felt that she doesn't meet the qualifications one would need. She feels more like a damsel in distress than a bounty hunter. This is where 2001's Noir comes in.  The story of Noir follows Japanese high school student Kirika Yuumura as she tries to regain her lost memories with the help of Mireille Bouquet, a professional assassin. After the two meet, they are led to believe they have little to no connection with each other. However, they slowly learn that their pasts intertwine more than they realize. Both were chosen by Les Soldats, a secret society that believes the girls will become Noir -- a pair of female assassins who are harbingers of death. As a child, Kirika was trained by Les Soldats to be an efficient assassin, killing both of Mireille's parents at age eight. When she was 15, she was sent to Japan, but lost her memories in an unknown event.  RELATED: Spy x Family: Loid Proposes to [SPOILER] in the Most Iconic Way to Complete the Family                 Mireille is Kirika's Corsican partner and one of the most accomplished assassins for hire. After being lured to Japan by an email sent by Kirika, the two are attacked by a group of men firing guns at them. Mireille is held at gunpoint, but Kirika returns and saves her. After tending to Mireille's injuries, she agrees to help Kirika regain her memories, and the two begin living together in Paris. As the two begin working together on missions, Mireille becomes more and more aware of Kirika's assassination skill, despite both being under the impression that she was just a high school student. The two slowly become closer the more they work together, despite Mireille's attempts to keep Kirika at a distance. Over the course of the series, the two meet people who they are unsure if they can trust, knowing that anyone could be part of the group that's after them.  The series was created and written by Ryoe Tsukimura in 2001. Spanning 26 episodes, it was produced by Victor Entertainment and Bee Train and featured character designs by Yoko Kikuchi, Minako Shiba and Satoko Miyachi. The show aired on TV Tokyo from April to September before being released on DVD, and it was distributed in North America by Funimation. RELATED: Heroines Run the Show Takes Idol Anime in a New Direction                 Where Love of Kill falls flat, Noir excels, as both Kirika and Mireille are capable killers. Despite her young age, Kirika is able to take out multiple people, sometimes at the same time, without issue, while Chateau struggles to complete her missions at several points. Even if she is new to bounty hunting, she had to have training at some point. Having someone brand-new go out on missions by herself without training not only puts the hire in danger but also the people around her, as well as her company.  Kirika and Mireille live up to the idea that they are candidates for being Noir. Even before meeting Kirika, Mireille is said to be the best in her field. Kirika was trained from a young age to be a killer, and having her instincts remain intact after losing her memories solidifies this. She's able to adapt to most situations quickly, and even if she runs into trouble, Mireille is able to pick up where Kirika left off. These two are excellent examples of female assassins who are actually good at their jobs.

Ninja and basketball players are coming together for a brand-new Naruto collaboration.  Announced on Twitter, Nike's Jordan Brand and the iconic shōnen series will seemingly collaborate on a new line of Naruto-inspired footwear. While details about the exact nature of the collaboration are forthcoming, it was revealed that New Orleans Pelicans' power forward Zion Williamson will contribute to the project as well. ""Excited to share this story with the world. The [Jordan] Zion 1 x Naruto Collection is inspired by our parallel paths of overcoming adversity. Stay tuned!"" Williamson wrote on Twitter. RELATED: Boruto's Scariest Moment With Sasuke Subverted Naruto's Old Rivalry        Both Williamson and Jordan Brand's official Twitter shared an image of the Jumpman logo and Naruto Uzumaki performing a slam dunk, with Jordans captioning the photo, ""The Shinobi Way."" Based on Williamson's tweet, the upcoming collection will involve the athlete's Zion 1 sneaker.  The Naruto manga series by Masashi Kishimoto was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, producing 72 volumes. With over 250 million copies sold globally, it is one of the best-selling manga series of all time alongside classics like Eiichiro Oda's One Piece, Gosho Aoyama's Detective Conan and Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball. Studio Pierrot and Aniplex adapted the manga into two anime series: Naruto, which aired from 2002 to 2007 and covered the first part of the story, and Naruto: Shippuden, which ran from 2007 to 2017 and covered the post-time skip portion of the narrative. Between the two, there are over 700 episodes.   RELATED: Naruto: The Disturbing Secret Behind Rock Lee and Might Guy's 'Nice Guy' Pose The new partnership with Jordan Brand isn't the only recent collaboration for the Naruto franchise. Sanrio recently released a unique set of vinyl figures which saw Hello Kitty and Chococat dressed as Naruto Uzumaki and his rival Sasuke Uchiha, respectively. The figurines retail for $94.99 each and pre-orders are currently being accepted. Jewelry brand Mister SFC also launched a new collection in 2021 that featured rings, necklaces, pendants, earrings and pendants inspired by Naruto's iconic weapons, including Zabuza's sword and Asuma's chakra blades.  Nike isn't the first footwear brand to embark on a Naruto-inspired line of sneakers. In January of this year, Japanese sportswear company Mizuno collaborated with Naruto on a line of sneakers designed after the anime's three main characters: Naruto Uzumaki, Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. However, unlike the upcoming Jordan Brand collaboration, Mizuno's ""Contender"" line is only available at certain Japanese retailers, or on the company's website.  All of Naruto can be streamed on Hulu and Crunchyroll.

One talented Studio Ghibli fan has created an epic cross-stitch portrait of one of Princess Mononoke's most deadly characters.  The portrait of San was uploaded to Reddit by the account Artonauts, and showcases the character's iconic facial markings and mask. According to the creator, they drew the pattern themselves, and their artwork is heavily inspired by ""90s games pixel art."" Cross-stitch portraits of other popular anime characters like Sailor Moon and Ryuko from Kill al Kill can be found on the account as well. RELATED: Sailor Moon Knight Fan Art Is the Ultimate Lunar Hero Crossover   Princess Mononoke portrait, by me from       ghibli    A form of counted-thread embroidery, cross-stitch is increasingly becoming a popular medium for fans to express their love and passion for pop culture properties. It involves using x-shaped stitches in a tiled pattern to form an image; the stitcher counts the individual threads on their piece of evenweave fabric (i.e., aida cloth, linen or needlepoint canvas) to make sure their stitches remain consistent in appearance and size.  Written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke made its debut in Japan in 1997; it was released in the United States in 1999 with an English script by Neil Gaiman. Set in the Muromachi period of Japan, the story follows Ashitaka, a young prince of the Emishi people, who becomes involved in a struggle between gods and humans. The film grossed over $160 million at the global box office and won several prestigious awards, including Picture of the Year at the 21st Japan Academy Awards and Best Film at the 52nd Mainichi Film Awards. RELATED: Electrifying Pokémon Fan Art Reimagines a Legendary Monster as Mech  Many of the narrative elements of Princess Mononoke are similar to those in one of Miyazaki's earlier works -- a graphic novel titled Shuna's Journey, which was first published in Japan in 1983. The novel is set in a small mountain valley and follows the titular prince who sets forth on a journey to find a magical grain that may save his people from a deadly famine. The first-ever English release of Shuna's Journey is scheduled to hit stores on Nov. 1. Princess Mononoke is one of the movies featured in this year's Studio Ghibli Fest. It kicked off the annual event earlier this month, playing in theaters on April, 3, 4 and 6. The other movies included in the lineup are Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, Kiki's Delivery Service, Ponyo, The Cat Returns and Only Yesterday.  Many iconic and beloved films by Studio Ghibli, including Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo and Spirited Away, are available to stream on HBO Max.

The following article contains spoilers for Tiger & Bunny 2 Episode 8, ""You Can't Judge A Book By Its Cover,"" now streaming on Netflix.   Up to this point, Tiger & Bunny 2 has had an episode spotlighting each of the new members of Stern Bild's First League -- except for the mysterious He Is Thomas. While the season has offered brief glimpses of his backstory, he's remained in the background until now.  That all changes with Tiger & Bunny 2's eighth episode, which opens on He Is Thomas and his partner Mr. Black attempting to apprehend a criminal. When the duo briefly loses focus for a second, the criminal shoots a civilian in the leg, causing He Is Thomas to go berserk and beat the perpetrator to a pulp. RELATED: Spy X Family: Loid & Yor's Chance Meeting Proved They're a Perfect Match                The incident causes a massive media storm and results in He Is Thomas's temporary suspension from the First League, leading Thomas to declare that the incident validates his belief that all he can trust in is himself, to the protests of his fellow heroes. Barnaby sympathizes with the newcomer's plight -- after all, he was also a heavily guarded loner back in the first season.  It's here where Thomas's backstory is finally revealed in full. After being orphaned by a car accident, Thomas and his sister Ruby were sent to an institution. Thomas wanted to stay with his sister but had trouble being adopted due to anti-NEXT discrimination -- a recurring theme throughout the season -- and the orphanage's director attempted to re-home Ruby by herself. The incident led to Thomas and Ruby running away, finding shelter in the slums. However, the pair were accosted by a group of criminals, and Ruby was inadvertently shot in the leg during the altercation. The two were eventually found and sent back to the institution, and Ruby alone was re-homed. The incident goes a long way to explaining why gunshots are such a trigger for Thomas, hence his actions at the beginning of the episode.  RELATED: One Piece: Every Moment That Foreshadowed Luffy's New Form                Since the incident, Thomas has been a lone wolf, preferring to rely on his own strength to get by -- a creed internalized due to Thomas' idolization of an infamous vigilante called L.L. Audun. Audun was the greatest rival of Mr. Legend, the acclaimed superhero mentioned several times in the first season, and who lived by his catchphrase of ""believe in nothing but your own strength."" Thomas isn't the only one who internalized that creed, as it is revealed that Fugan and Mugan, the sinister silver-haired duo who have been picking off heroes, also worship Audun. While their motives remain a mystery, it's a revelation that goes a long way to informing the mysterious pair.  Things start looking up for Thomas when he helps an elderly couple get home and they invite him to dinner for the favor. Thomas usually sticks to a strict bodybuilding diet of chicken and broccoli, so the fact that he devours the lasagna served to him by the couple shows that he has the capacity to lower his guard from time to time. He then watches a broadcast of the heroes, all squeezing Thomas's signature stress ball in solidarity with the hero. He finds the effort touching, and the episode seems set for a sentimental resolution like the rest of the episodes this season -- but then things take a sinister turn.  RELATED: Dragon Ball Z Figure Set Recreates Gohan’s Most Iconic Victory                It turns out that the kindly elderly couple are in fact serial burglars who have drugged their guest, hoping to frame a sedated Thomas for their crimes. Unfortunately for them, they have no idea that Thomas is a NEXT, and he retaliates by beating them and departing, vowing that he'll never make the mistake of trusting people ever again, ending the episode in the same place it started. Thomas isn't the only one things go wrong for, as during the episode's final scene, a rescue at a museum has horrible results for Kotetsu and Barnaby. As Kotetsu is rescuing exhibits, an explosion sounds, and he turns to see a charred Barnaby hurtling through the air before the episode hard cuts to credits. It's a dour note to end on, and a harsh wake-up call that the light-hearted antics that have defined the first half of the season are officially over. Now comes the time for drama.
