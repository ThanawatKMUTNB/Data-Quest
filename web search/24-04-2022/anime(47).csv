I'm guessing J. Michael Tatum contracting COVID made it difficult to get him back by the 1st episode, and Emily Ernst only really comes back to voice Reine so maybe they couldn't get her back in time for the 1st episode on whatever production pipeline they have with these dubs.    I think Mallorie Rodak will be a great fit for Nia.     getchman wrote:    4th ADR director for the show, that's kinda amusing           It's basically mirroring how the show changes animation studios every season. Kind of like how Takagi jumped from Funi, to Netflix, to Sentai.

I hadn't heard that, but it would make sense why he would be unavailable for just the first episode.  Hopefully, he makes a good recovery.

Yeah, and saying it's ""temporary"" at least means they're basically saving the role for him when he's well again (and presumably they'll redub the episodes for the DVD release).    Also looks like they will use remote recording for any VA's who moved to LA like Tatum and Felicia Angelle.

I'm guessing J. Michael Tatum contracting COVID made it difficult to get him back by the 1st episode, and Emily Ernst only really comes back to voice Reine so maybe they couldn't get her back in time for the 1st episode on whatever production pipeline they have with these dubs.    I think Mallorie Rodak will be a great fit for Nia.     getchman wrote:    4th ADR director for the show, that's kinda amusing           It's basically mirroring how the show changes animation studios every season.

Yeah, and saying it's ""temporary"" at least means they're basically saving the role for him when he's well again (and presumably they'll redub the episodes for the DVD release).    Also looks like they will use remote recording for any VA's who moved to LA like Tatum and Felicia Angelle.

I'm guessing J. Michael Tatum contracting COVID made it difficult to get him back by the 1st episode, and Emily Ernst only really comes back to voice Reine so maybe they couldn't get her back in time for the 1st episode on whatever production pipeline they have with these dubs.    I think Mallorie Rodak will be a great fit for Nia.     getchman wrote:    4th ADR director for the show, that's kinda amusing           It's basically mirroring how the show changes animation studios every season.

Hopefully, he makes a good recovery.           Yeah, and saying it's ""temporary"" at least means they're basically saving the role for him when he's well again (and presumably they'll redub the episodes for the DVD release).    Also looks like they will use remote recording for any VA's who moved to LA like Tatum and Felicia Angelle.

Michael Tatum contracting COVID made it difficult to get him back by the 1st episode, and Emily Ernst only really comes back to voice Reine so maybe they couldn't get her back in time for the 1st episode on whatever production pipeline they have with these dubs.    I think Mallorie Rodak will be a great fit for Nia.     getchman wrote:    4th ADR director for the show, that's kinda amusing           It's basically mirroring how the show changes animation studios every season. Kind of like how Takagi jumped from Funi, to Netflix, to Sentai.

I hadn't heard that, but it would make sense why he would be unavailable for just the first episode.  Hopefully, he makes a good recovery.

Hopefully, he makes a good recovery.           Yeah, and saying it's ""temporary"" at least means they're basically saving the role for him when he's well again (and presumably they'll redub the episodes for the DVD release).    Also looks like they will use remote recording for any VA's who moved to LA like Tatum and Felicia Angelle.

Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 Episodes 27-28  by Christopher Farris, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 28 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5            After the premiere episode for this season of Ascendance of a Bookworm laid out the setup for the new status quo of the series moving forward, the next episode is able to move on from that and get right on…continuing to lay out the setup for the new status quo. Look, Main's only barely moved into the cathedral, and there's still a whole winter season coming that she's going to have to stay through. There's going to be an adjustment period, and the struggles therein are what we're currently following along with all the structural shifts affected by our titular tiny bookworm. The show's presentation and explanation of so many of those worldbuilding elements are as considered and thoughtful as ever. But there might be something of a balance issue in its focus on those elements alongside the more emotionally-affective material of the 28th episode.    Coming off the evocative depictions of Main's homesickness from the very end of the 27th episode, the 28th continues to utilize that vibe to great effect. There's a mildly montage-based feeling to the snippets of Main's days as she misses her family, taking what moments of affection she can from interacting with Lutz or getting to entertain a brief visit with her sister Tuuli. But it works anyway because the ennui, the melancholy of those days passing by, is precisely what this series is trying to hammer home. It's not simply the situation of being apart from her loved ones that's getting to Main; it's the sheer amount of time spent like that which increases that lonely feeling. Presenting things in that aforementioned montage style does an effective job of communicating that passage of time within a relatively short portion of the episode's runtime. Bookworm generally has a good handle on getting a lot of different stuff to fit into its episodes efficiently, and given that this is basically the emotional core of the story at this point, it's important that it lands so well.    It's also important given that it's basically the only thing carrying the audience's engagement on any personal level, as the other aspects covered in Episode 28 are pretty much all business. That's another component that's come to be expected from the Bookworm experience, of course, so we get details like Main's crew pivoting to prioritizing game production since they can't make paper in the winter, or dealing with the logistics of things like picking out a chef for her stay in the cathedral. That highlights another issue Main's dealing with: having to remain as isolated from outer elements of the Church's structure as possible to protect her from interlopers like the Ink Guild (the point of which gets more information later in this episode, and I will touch on that in a minute), which only exacerbates her lonely, disconnected feeling in this whole affair. Though we also get to see Main prioritizing teaching writing as the next phase of her education efforts, providing plenty of opportunities for her cute little chibi literary fantasies, so that lends some lighter characteristic content as well.    But then there's the other major thrust of this episode, as Benno sits down with Ferdinand so they can discuss what's actually going on with the Ink Guild's pursuit of Main, and how that speaks to the broader goings-on of the story. There are a few more funny little chibi asides from Main here, but much of this still comes off like housekeeping. The concept here is solidly well-thought-out: The point that Main's isekai-displaced knowledge and massive mana pool makes her a desirable asset for various factions and forces out there. And I can mostly buy that this was an aspect that Main herself was blissfully unaware of before now due to her being occupied with her own efforts (which ironically resulted in the very reforms that got these peoples' attention), and that Ferdinand had previously held off on telling her about it.    It can feel like a take-off on the way so many isekai stories end up with their world revolving around their protagonists. Main's efforts at revolutionizing this world may have been borne out of her simple desire to bring more books into it, but you don't affect those kinds of seismic shifts without bringing about a bunch more changes and getting the attention of higher powers most affected. So I appreciate the ultimate realization that, in this case, the isekai protagonist having all this attention and focus on them by the world is very much not a good thing. But it can also come off like a sudden dumping of massive importance onto the tiny shoulders of this girl who was already working just fine as the focal character for the show, and the exposition in getting there can feel as rote and dry as Bookworm can ever be in delivering these kinds of details, brief chibi interludes notwithstanding. There's almost a sense of tonal imbalance, like the emotional core focusing on Main's homesickness should have been closer to the actual center of this episode's story.    Thankfully, Episode 28 is able to restore that balance with more of an emotionally-focused idea at the end. With the possibility of being married/adopted into a noble family as a manner of formal protection for the pursuits of interlopers, Main has to steadfastly reiterate her dedication to her family. Her confrontation with Ferdinand here effectively springboards off the interactions with her memories from the end of the last season, reinforcing the point that her sadness at not being able to see her pre-isekai family anymore has only deepened her attachment to her 'new' family in this world. It helps connect things back to that homesickness element that drove things earlier, making the thematics of this story feel a little more like a closed circle. Not that it's completely finished here, as the writing still definitely wants us to consider the question of whether Ferdinand is trying to manipulate Main's move into nobility by saying she'd be putting her family in danger otherwise, or if he actually has a point. Ascendance of a Bookworm has always been a story with an eye firmly on the long-term, so we'll likely be considering that for a while yet. And even with the sheer amount of infodumping in these opening episodes, they still do a good enough job also seeding the emotional through-lines we'll be following for the time.

Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 Episodes 27-28  by Christopher Farris, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 28 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5            After the premiere episode for this season of Ascendance of a Bookworm laid out the setup for the new status quo of the series moving forward, the next episode is able to move on from that and get right on…continuing to lay out the setup for the new status quo. Look, Main's only barely moved into the cathedral, and there's still a whole winter season coming that she's going to have to stay through. There's going to be an adjustment period, and the struggles therein are what we're currently following along with all the structural shifts affected by our titular tiny bookworm. The show's presentation and explanation of so many of those worldbuilding elements are as considered and thoughtful as ever. But there might be something of a balance issue in its focus on those elements alongside the more emotionally-affective material of the 28th episode.    Coming off the evocative depictions of Main's homesickness from the very end of the 27th episode, the 28th continues to utilize that vibe to great effect. There's a mildly montage-based feeling to the snippets of Main's days as she misses her family, taking what moments of affection she can from interacting with Lutz or getting to entertain a brief visit with her sister Tuuli. But it works anyway because the ennui, the melancholy of those days passing by, is precisely what this series is trying to hammer home. It's not simply the situation of being apart from her loved ones that's getting to Main; it's the sheer amount of time spent like that which increases that lonely feeling. Presenting things in that aforementioned montage style does an effective job of communicating that passage of time within a relatively short portion of the episode's runtime. Bookworm generally has a good handle on getting a lot of different stuff to fit into its episodes efficiently, and given that this is basically the emotional core of the story at this point, it's important that it lands so well.    It's also important given that it's basically the only thing carrying the audience's engagement on any personal level, as the other aspects covered in Episode 28 are pretty much all business. That's another component that's come to be expected from the Bookworm experience, of course, so we get details like Main's crew pivoting to prioritizing game production since they can't make paper in the winter, or dealing with the logistics of things like picking out a chef for her stay in the cathedral. That highlights another issue Main's dealing with: having to remain as isolated from outer elements of the Church's structure as possible to protect her from interlopers like the Ink Guild (the point of which gets more information later in this episode, and I will touch on that in a minute), which only exacerbates her lonely, disconnected feeling in this whole affair. Though we also get to see Main prioritizing teaching writing as the next phase of her education efforts, providing plenty of opportunities for her cute little chibi literary fantasies, so that lends some lighter characteristic content as well.    But then there's the other major thrust of this episode, as Benno sits down with Ferdinand so they can discuss what's actually going on with the Ink Guild's pursuit of Main, and how that speaks to the broader goings-on of the story. There are a few more funny little chibi asides from Main here, but much of this still comes off like housekeeping. The concept here is solidly well-thought-out: The point that Main's isekai-displaced knowledge and massive mana pool makes her a desirable asset for various factions and forces out there. And I can mostly buy that this was an aspect that Main herself was blissfully unaware of before now due to her being occupied with her own efforts (which ironically resulted in the very reforms that got these peoples' attention), and that Ferdinand had previously held off on telling her about it.    It can feel like a take-off on the way so many isekai stories end up with their world revolving around their protagonists. Main's efforts at revolutionizing this world may have been borne out of her simple desire to bring more books into it, but you don't affect those kinds of seismic shifts without bringing about a bunch more changes and getting the attention of higher powers most affected. So I appreciate the ultimate realization that, in this case, the isekai protagonist having all this attention and focus on them by the world is very much not a good thing. But it can also come off like a sudden dumping of massive importance onto the tiny shoulders of this girl who was already working just fine as the focal character for the show, and the exposition in getting there can feel as rote and dry as Bookworm can ever be in delivering these kinds of details, brief chibi interludes notwithstanding. There's almost a sense of tonal imbalance, like the emotional core focusing on Main's homesickness should have been closer to the actual center of this episode's story.    Thankfully, Episode 28 is able to restore that balance with more of an emotionally-focused idea at the end. With the possibility of being married/adopted into a noble family as a manner of formal protection for the pursuits of interlopers, Main has to steadfastly reiterate her dedication to her family. Her confrontation with Ferdinand here effectively springboards off the interactions with her memories from the end of the last season, reinforcing the point that her sadness at not being able to see her pre-isekai family anymore has only deepened her attachment to her 'new' family in this world. It helps connect things back to that homesickness element that drove things earlier, making the thematics of this story feel a little more like a closed circle. Not that it's completely finished here, as the writing still definitely wants us to consider the question of whether Ferdinand is trying to manipulate Main's move into nobility by saying she'd be putting her family in danger otherwise, or if he actually has a point. Ascendance of a Bookworm has always been a story with an eye firmly on the long-term, so we'll likely be considering that for a while yet. And even with the sheer amount of infodumping in these opening episodes, they still do a good enough job also seeding the emotional through-lines we'll be following for the time.

Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3 Episodes 27-28  by Christopher Farris, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5                  How would you rate episode 28 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5            After the premiere episode for this season of Ascendance of a Bookworm laid out the setup for the new status quo of the series moving forward, the next episode is able to move on from that and get right on…continuing to lay out the setup for the new status quo. Look, Main's only barely moved into the cathedral, and there's still a whole winter season coming that she's going to have to stay through. There's going to be an adjustment period, and the struggles therein are what we're currently following along with all the structural shifts affected by our titular tiny bookworm. The show's presentation and explanation of so many of those worldbuilding elements are as considered and thoughtful as ever. But there might be something of a balance issue in its focus on those elements alongside the more emotionally-affective material of the 28th episode.    Coming off the evocative depictions of Main's homesickness from the very end of the 27th episode, the 28th continues to utilize that vibe to great effect. There's a mildly montage-based feeling to the snippets of Main's days as she misses her family, taking what moments of affection she can from interacting with Lutz or getting to entertain a brief visit with her sister Tuuli. But it works anyway because the ennui, the melancholy of those days passing by, is precisely what this series is trying to hammer home. It's not simply the situation of being apart from her loved ones that's getting to Main; it's the sheer amount of time spent like that which increases that lonely feeling. Presenting things in that aforementioned montage style does an effective job of communicating that passage of time within a relatively short portion of the episode's runtime. Bookworm generally has a good handle on getting a lot of different stuff to fit into its episodes efficiently, and given that this is basically the emotional core of the story at this point, it's important that it lands so well.    It's also important given that it's basically the only thing carrying the audience's engagement on any personal level, as the other aspects covered in Episode 28 are pretty much all business. That's another component that's come to be expected from the Bookworm experience, of course, so we get details like Main's crew pivoting to prioritizing game production since they can't make paper in the winter, or dealing with the logistics of things like picking out a chef for her stay in the cathedral. That highlights another issue Main's dealing with: having to remain as isolated from outer elements of the Church's structure as possible to protect her from interlopers like the Ink Guild (the point of which gets more information later in this episode, and I will touch on that in a minute), which only exacerbates her lonely, disconnected feeling in this whole affair. Though we also get to see Main prioritizing teaching writing as the next phase of her education efforts, providing plenty of opportunities for her cute little chibi literary fantasies, so that lends some lighter characteristic content as well.    But then there's the other major thrust of this episode, as Benno sits down with Ferdinand so they can discuss what's actually going on with the Ink Guild's pursuit of Main, and how that speaks to the broader goings-on of the story. There are a few more funny little chibi asides from Main here, but much of this still comes off like housekeeping. The concept here is solidly well-thought-out: The point that Main's isekai-displaced knowledge and massive mana pool makes her a desirable asset for various factions and forces out there. And I can mostly buy that this was an aspect that Main herself was blissfully unaware of before now due to her being occupied with her own efforts (which ironically resulted in the very reforms that got these peoples' attention), and that Ferdinand had previously held off on telling her about it.    It can feel like a take-off on the way so many isekai stories end up with their world revolving around their protagonists. Main's efforts at revolutionizing this world may have been borne out of her simple desire to bring more books into it, but you don't affect those kinds of seismic shifts without bringing about a bunch more changes and getting the attention of higher powers most affected. So I appreciate the ultimate realization that, in this case, the isekai protagonist having all this attention and focus on them by the world is very much not a good thing. But it can also come off like a sudden dumping of massive importance onto the tiny shoulders of this girl who was already working just fine as the focal character for the show, and the exposition in getting there can feel as rote and dry as Bookworm can ever be in delivering these kinds of details, brief chibi interludes notwithstanding. There's almost a sense of tonal imbalance, like the emotional core focusing on Main's homesickness should have been closer to the actual center of this episode's story.    Thankfully, Episode 28 is able to restore that balance with more of an emotionally-focused idea at the end. With the possibility of being married/adopted into a noble family as a manner of formal protection for the pursuits of interlopers, Main has to steadfastly reiterate her dedication to her family. Her confrontation with Ferdinand here effectively springboards off the interactions with her memories from the end of the last season, reinforcing the point that her sadness at not being able to see her pre-isekai family anymore has only deepened her attachment to her 'new' family in this world. It helps connect things back to that homesickness element that drove things earlier, making the thematics of this story feel a little more like a closed circle. Not that it's completely finished here, as the writing still definitely wants us to consider the question of whether Ferdinand is trying to manipulate Main's move into nobility by saying she'd be putting her family in danger otherwise, or if he actually has a point. Ascendance of a Bookworm has always been a story with an eye firmly on the long-term, so we'll likely be considering that for a while yet. And even with the sheer amount of infodumping in these opening episodes, they still do a good enough job also seeding the emotional through-lines we'll be following for the time.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her.

In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go.

Community score: 3.9              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother.

Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

The film's producer Daisuke Hiraga stated the staff is gradually increasing the number of theaters that are screening the film.    The film opened in 34 theaters in Japan on April 1, ranking at #10 and earning 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned.

The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime.

News Odd Taxi Anime Film Earns 130 Million Yen   posted on 2022-04-24 10:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Film opened in 34 theaters in Japan on April 1    The Mainichi Shimbun's Mantan Web site reported on Sunday that Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods, the film project of the original anime Odd Taxi, has earned 130 million yen (about US$1.01 million). The film's producer Daisuke Hiraga stated the staff is gradually increasing the number of theaters that are screening the film.    The film opened in 34 theaters in Japan on April 1, ranking at #10 and earning 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned. ASMIK Ace is distributing. Crunchyroll will stream the film.    The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale.    The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc. P.I.C.S. and OLM produced the anime. P.I.C.S. was also credited for the original work and planning.

The film opened in 34 theaters in Japan on April 1, ranking at #10 and earning 52 million yen (approximately US$4,23,685) in its first weekend.    The television anime's main cast and staff returned.

The anime premiered in Japan in April 2021 and aired for 13 episodes. Crunchyroll streamed the anime in the West.    The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime. Baku Kinoshita directed the anime with Norio Nitta as the assistant director. Kinoshita and Hiromi Nakayama designed the characters. Kohei Yoshida was the recording director at Pony Canyon Enterprise. PUNPEE VaVa OMSB were in charge of the music, and Pony Canyon was in charge of music production with collaboration by Summit, Inc.

These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.    Manga creator Kadzuya Konomoto (Seto Utsumi) wrote the anime.

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

PREVIEW: The Mecha Action-Shooter Gundam Evolution   by Jean-Karlo Lemus, Apr 14th 2022          The Gundam universe has no shortage of video game adaptations, and this past week saw the five-day-long network test for Bandai Namco's newest take on the storied franchise. Gundam Evolution stands poised to be the franchise's first-ever free-to-play shooter. We were allowed to take part in the network test for the Steam version of the game and experience it first-hand.     As the title implies, players operate as specific mobile suits from across the Gundam franchise. The selection of mech units is surprisingly eclectic: while the traditional RX-78-2 Mobile Suit is of course selectable, armed with its beam cannon and hammer, players can also control the Turn ∀  Gundam, the Gundam Exia, the Barbatos Gundam, and even non-Gundam units like the Guntank, the Zaku II, and the Dom. Each unit controls more or less the same, with the main differences being the nature of their weapons and their skills: while most units like the RX-78 focus on ranged weapons, some units like the Barbatos or the Exia focus on melee attacks. Being mechs, each unit has thrusters that allow for dashes, boosts, and hovering, adding lots of complexity to movement. Each unit also features two unique skills with cooldowns, and a chargeable G-maneuver that unleashes a special skill. During our playtime, we specialized in the Turn ∀ Gundam, which featured a charge shot for their beam canon, a personal healing skill, and a grappling attack. In all, there are 14 playable units.    Gundam Evolution's network test consisted of simple online ranked matches where teams of six compete against each other. Three gameplay modes will be featured in the full game: Point Capture, Domination, and Destruction. Each mode features teams alternating between Attackers and Defenders, tasked with either carrying out specific objectives or preventing the opposing team from carrying them out. Domination requires Attackers to capture one of three randomly-spawning objectives, Destruction requires charging a bomb at a point on the map until it detonates the point, and Point Capture involves simply occupying a point on the map in order to score points. During our time in the Network Test, we only experienced Point Capture. We also only tested out one map, but there was no shortage of excitement to be had. Further gameplay modes have been promised in the future following the full release of the title.     Matches are a good mix of hectic chaos and tense anticipation. A lack of awareness will get you destroyed in short order, thus a keen eye and quick reflexes are essential to survival. It's possible to rescue downed units before they're destroyed, albeit at the risk of leaving yourself open to attackers that are no doubt still in the area. Capture points quickly become heated clashes between teams as they're contested, the ebb and flow of the match varying as units are shot down or respawn to rejoin the fray. A well-balanced match can easily run into overtime as both teams struggle for a foothold above the other. The connections were stable, however we did experience a drop from the network during one particularly heated match. With Gundam Evolution still being tested and refined, we can hope that this problem will be smoothed over.    Gundam Evolution is free-to-play and features an in-game cash shop, as well as a battle pass, alternate skins, and player icons. Old Gundams can be customized with snazzy recolors, while players can set their profile pictures to images of beloved Gundam characters like Amuro Ray or Char Aznable. Skins can also be earned by leveling up with your battle pass; the network test featured an exclusive skin for the RX-78 attainable upon reaching level 20. For the most part, skins seem to be available through a lootbox system, which players buy into via tickets earned from the cash shop or from in-game awards.     In all, Gundam Evolution's network test was a success. While some network issues interrupted the fun and the looming threat of a lootbox system shadows the game, the moment-to-moment gameplay is fun and frantic and the sheer fanservice of zipping through the map as the White Devil, complete with classic Gundam sound effects, is undeniably charming. While a definite release date has yet to be set, players can look forward to Gundam Evolution's release later this year on PS4, Xbox One, PS5, Xbox Series S and X, and Steam.     discuss this in the forum (5 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Feature homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime.

Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol.

Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.            Yeah, Ponta using those absurdly large video game pauldrons to ride on is a great use of them lol      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Fri Apr 15, 2022 4:38 pm            This seems like it's setting up to be a fairly fun and enjoyable RPG Isekai romp, though I feel like it'll really settle into its own once we properly meet the female lead.   Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.

As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.  How much more preventing can you ask for exactly?

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.

I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.            If that's true, it's a shame. I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

On the whole, you will get way more of Arc being Arc than scenes of rape or gore. Just know there will be more of that unless they decided to tone things down in adaptation. (Doesn't seem like it. :p)   Skeletal Knight does avoid some of the usual isekai pitfalls and has more of an old school fantasy vibe if you can ignore the shlock. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of The Executioner and Her Way of Life or Ascendance of a Bookworm.

Sexual violence exists in the world, and it's absolutely legitimate to talk about it in fiction. But it should never be casually thrown around like it's some sort of narrative spice that can be sprinkled on to lend your story some ""darkness"" with a side order of titillation. I've not read the LN, so I've no idea how well it'll be handled here, but I'm not hugely optimistic. Either way, it's not really what I was looking for from this show.

I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.            I don't think the two are contradictory at all.  If he had run out there recklessly and gotten killed, the two would have been guaranteed to be raped.  Intervening and failing isn't just a risk to Arc.  It is a risk to the two women as well because nobody else is there to help.  As other have said, there is, for at least the episodes we have right now, an ongoing theme of Arc not knowing how strong he is.   In hindsight from our pov, Arc's plan didn't matter.  He could have just walked up and killed them all.  However, he didn't know that so he instead came up with the plan to take the rapists by surprise.  Again, Arc getting killed trying to help doesn't help anyone and guarantees that the two women he prevented from getting raped would have been raped.  You're penalizing Arc as a character for coming up with a higher success rate approach that does in fact prevent the rape.

I don't understand why some writers feel the need to beat audiences over the head with the most viscerally repugnant content they can imagine, especially when they know they're not going to address it in any meaningful way, let alone give it the treatment it deserves. And before someone tries to go there, yes, this applies to gore as well. Spending time to detail the process of someone getting bisected or dismembered or beheaded adds nothing to the story, demonstrates nothing, and shines no light on anything in any sense other than trying to out-shock the last shocking event you think people saw. Generally it seems like over the last 10-15 years you have a number of series saying, ""well, we can't think of any more shockingly graphic death scenes, I guess we'll shock people with sexual assaults instead.""    I'll stop ranting now. I might keep going with the series a while to see how things play out. I assumed the Ep1 situation was a one and done deal, but my hopes for the series have been diminished.

But just because the world has lots of evil in it, doesn't mean the people that live within it must disallow happiness from their lives to maintain a 'tone'.   Are we really saying that Arc and company are not allowed to lead happy and enjoyable lives, despite the evil they fight in their lives.   I can see maintaining a tone in children's entertainment, but this is anime.   I have no problem with anyone complaining about the rape scene.  We all watch anime for different reasons, and some scenes are too much for some.  Personally, I think the mix of darker and lighter scenes is more realistic to real life.  One day you can be partying with friends, the next day one of them dies from a DUI.   And yes. there is even more evil and nastier stuff going on. spoiler[nothing is implied, it simply exists.  the elves and demi-humans are being enslaved for labor, sexual slavery, and breeding children for magic ability.  For the last two items, that is through rape. ]  The anime has been faithful to the light novel considering these scenes.  Which bodes well for those of us that want a faithful adaptation.  But if the current content bothers you, I don't recommend watching anymore.  Future scenes could be just as bad, and you will know exactly what is going on.

Not amazing, but not bad either.  If Arc's look in the game was due to spoiler[a skin instead of a race choice], then maybe that's why he can do things like eat and be hungry? (not sure if that's a spoiler...)     Quote:    I'm a simple man: Ponta running laps across Arc's enormous pauldrons got a solid laugh out of me.

Things got pretty explicit in the first episode but I'm glad nothing happened to Maca and her family and it was a fairly wholesome second episode.   Tomoaki Maeno is really selling Arc's character. He has a laugh that would do Skeletor proud.    Ponta is adorable.

Aside the the dumb rape plot device that was clearly thrown in just to get shock value, not to mention the horrible way the chose to handle it, much of the rest of the first episode goes through the paces of table setting over the course of 20+ minutes that many other isekai have more recently seen fit to relegate to brief mention via monologue or narration, or at least more artfully sprinkle throughout a number of episodes.    Episode 2 is better, but still feels like it's ""uneven"". I think, however, that unevenness is deliberate and a consequence of the MC's personality. He still isn't adjusted to the fact that he's OP in this world right now, so he still acts super cautious and slow, seeming in fact to lack common sense. He isn't the typical pervy or lazy or power mad MCs we get w/ these isekais. He knows he's been isekai'd but not how. He didn't hate his past world, but doesn't seem to miss it either. So for the moment he seems more like a fantasy character lacking a background story just enjoying being a freshly minted adventurer learning everything.    Personally, as isekai MCs go, he's probably one of my favorites so far since they story isn't going out of its way to make him an absolute moron or some dark chuuni edgelord. They seem to want him to be a decent character you'll like, not force reasons for you to feel he's greasy and terrible and you gotta spend every other scene explaining away why ""he's not that bad"".

They were faithful to the light novel.  The prologue to the light novel is from the POV of the young ladies.  While the first chapter was Arc's arrival on the world and his POV from there.   Can't wait to get to the meat of the first arc, and see what everyone thinks.

It comes down to how its presented and its purpose, if its just for shock value or even worse titillation then that's annoying and even gross. It really did feel unnecessary. I think there are other ways to convey that this world can be dark and has its dangers.    The second episode was ok-ish? I'm willing to give the show another episode, because first episode complaints aside it seems like it may have the potential to be fun. However, its going to have to kick it into gear and find that funny bone some more if its going to hold my attention.

But he did do everything in his power to prevent it.  He stopped them before they could rape her, and he sliced them in half so they aren't going to be able to try that again.

It sounds like a fun show but I do not want to watch rape. Especially if it is not mitigated by the character doing everything he can to prevent it.            The rape scene is disappointing. It's longer than it needs to be, shown in unnecessary detail, with more dialog than is required. And shown twice on top of that. It's tonally out of step with the rest of the show. It could have been 5 seconds long. Some screams and the backs of a bunch of goons from a distance before Arc shows up and stops things. Even better, it could have been something else entirely - a highway robbery is still a serious enough crime to get across all the points being made (which I think are primarily ""Arc is a good but cautious guy not yet aware of his strength"")   It just speaks to the studio and the writers not treating rape as the incredibly serious and sensitive issue that is is. It's just an inconsequential shorthand for ""bad guys doing a bad thing"" and so we're not particularly conflicted when Arc straight up cleaves them in two. Which, admittedly and unfortunately, is pretty much a standard trope in anime.    But.. to loop back around to ""it's tonally out of step with the rest of the show"". It really is. The rest of the two episodes are ""Arc is a likeable doof who is pretty pleased to be a super-powered skeleton but is naturally cautious and is working hard to fit in"".   I'd suggest making full use of the +10s button to skip right though. You'll really not be missing out on anything worthwhile.

But thanks for your take on it, reading about how detailed and into the scene the show is is rather off putting.    As for your question @SilverTalon Well basicly the review descriptions and other like Thesarum have state how talked about how the scene was depicted (twice) with much detail and the reviews also talk about how the MC was struggling with risking himself to help them. I find rape abhorrent, among the most destructive acts that can be visited on a person. A hero trying to protect people from it can make it slightly less worse but hearing his hesitation takes that away just leaving the scene. I dont begrudge his desire to protect himself over others but it does nothing to help the conflictedness I experience. Horrible moments vs a fun time. What a bad mix.   I dont suppose you could provide time stamps to avoid the content? That would be cool.

That would be cool.            Honestly, you shouldn't bother picking this up for your own good. While not every arc in this series (*groan*) has scenes like the first episode, there will be at least two more instances of characters being threatened with rape. There will also be a worse scene where spoiler[Arc and company free pregnant slaves who were implied to have been raped repeatedly over a period of months, if not longer.]   Despite how jovial and even wholesome Arc can be, the actual world is much darker than his perspective usually suggests.   It is actually worse than Goblin Slayer in that it doesn't end at a singular event to set the tone, or imply it without description as in that series's LNs. It happens less as Skeletal Knight goes on, but I can't imagine how taxing it would be to watch while constantly wondering when the other shoe will drop.   It's a shame because while it is a fun story often enough, it's impossible to recommend without a list of trigger warnings.

She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party.           The thing is, spoiler[her stats stay low despite the levels rising(that fact will change later, dramatically so).]      Back to top                  TarsTarkas    Joined: 20 Dec 2007 		    Posts: 5321 		    Location: Virginia, United States 		        Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 8:23 pm            Glad this got picked up for episode reviews.   I found the review refreshing.   Anybody looking for anything good from the three heroes will be disappointed.  If they are who you care about, you are better off reading that evil tome, ""The Reprise of the Spear Hero"".  A blatant attempt by the vile Spear Hero to rewrite history.

Have to agree with most of what was said. Not sure how Risha will work as a character but as for being incompetent, she hasn't had much of a chance to do much yet and if anything, Naofumi seemingly sidelining her is uncharacteristic and annoying.

They are going to be fighting a giant turtle monster.  A monster that can flatten cities.  A monster that easily killed 10,000 trained soldiers.  I think Naofumi is entitled to be a bit worried for her, and possibly wonder if this 'particular' threat is a one way ticket to death for Risha.

There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.

I rewatched the volume 1 content of the anime, thinking maybe I misjudged it, but it really feels like the anime crew improved on the overall writing in that bit.   My question is, as someone who has read more than me... Should I expect the LN to improve? Is there anything of value you think I could get out of the LN that the anime hasn't given so far? Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party.           The thing is, spoiler[her stats stay low despite the levels rising(that fact will change later, dramatically so).]      Back to top                  TarsTarkas    Joined: 20 Dec 2007 		    Posts: 5321 		    Location: Virginia, United States 		        Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 8:23 pm            Glad this got picked up for episode reviews.   I found the review refreshing.   Anybody looking for anything good from the three heroes will be disappointed.  If they are who you care about, you are better off reading that evil tome, ""The Reprise of the Spear Hero"".  A blatant attempt by the vile Spear Hero to rewrite history.

Have to agree with most of what was said. Not sure how Risha will work as a character but as for being incompetent, she hasn't had much of a chance to do much yet and if anything, Naofumi seemingly sidelining her is uncharacteristic and annoying.

They are going to be fighting a giant turtle monster.  A monster that can flatten cities.  A monster that easily killed 10,000 trained soldiers.  I think Naofumi is entitled to be a bit worried for her, and possibly wonder if this 'particular' threat is a one way ticket to death for Risha.

What we've got less of is Maaya Uchida (although she and Sarah Emi Bridcutt are still playing sisters in DAL airing in the same season).   We do have Rishia who has joined the cast but I'm not sure if she's quite found a place for herself other than being a ball of anxiety, wearing animal costumes, and talking about ""itsuki-sama.""

There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

My question is, as someone who has read more than me... Should I expect the LN to improve? Is there anything of value you think I could get out of the LN that the anime hasn't given so far? Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           From what I heard the anime improved it. A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party.

I found the review refreshing.   Anybody looking for anything good from the three heroes will be disappointed.  If they are who you care about, you are better off reading that evil tome, ""The Reprise of the Spear Hero"".  A blatant attempt by the vile Spear Hero to rewrite history.

Have to agree with most of what was said. Not sure how Risha will work as a character but as for being incompetent, she hasn't had much of a chance to do much yet and if anything, Naofumi seemingly sidelining her is uncharacteristic and annoying.

They are going to be fighting a giant turtle monster.  A monster that can flatten cities.  A monster that easily killed 10,000 trained soldiers.  I think Naofumi is entitled to be a bit worried for her, and possibly wonder if this 'particular' threat is a one way ticket to death for Risha.

There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

Have to agree with most of what was said. Not sure how Risha will work as a character but as for being incompetent, she hasn't had much of a chance to do much yet and if anything, Naofumi seemingly sidelining her is uncharacteristic and annoying.

They are going to be fighting a giant turtle monster.  A monster that can flatten cities.  A monster that easily killed 10,000 trained soldiers.  I think Naofumi is entitled to be a bit worried for her, and possibly wonder if this 'particular' threat is a one way ticket to death for Risha.

There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           From what I heard the anime improved it. A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           From what I heard the anime improved it. A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

She seems to be rather skilled in magic, was a big help during the conflict at the end of season one, and if I was reading the game interface correctly, she is only a few levels lower than Naofumi and his party.           The thing is, spoiler[her stats stay low despite the levels rising(that fact will change later, dramatically so).]      Back to top                  TarsTarkas    Joined: 20 Dec 2007 		    Posts: 5321 		    Location: Virginia, United States 		        Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 8:23 pm            Glad this got picked up for episode reviews.   I found the review refreshing.   Anybody looking for anything good from the three heroes will be disappointed.  If they are who you care about, you are better off reading that evil tome, ""The Reprise of the Spear Hero"".  A blatant attempt by the vile Spear Hero to rewrite history.

Have to agree with most of what was said. Not sure how Risha will work as a character but as for being incompetent, she hasn't had much of a chance to do much yet and if anything, Naofumi seemingly sidelining her is uncharacteristic and annoying.

They are going to be fighting a giant turtle monster.  A monster that can flatten cities.  A monster that easily killed 10,000 trained soldiers.  I think Naofumi is entitled to be a bit worried for her, and possibly wonder if this 'particular' threat is a one way ticket to death for Risha.

What we've got less of is Maaya Uchida (although she and Sarah Emi Bridcutt are still playing sisters in DAL airing in the same season).

There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.

There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.

Personal subjective question. Anyone can answer if they have a different experience, but it seems like you and I might see alike.   I loved season one of Shield Hero. I felt like it had some pretty intentional story beats, structure, character writing, and world building, and its mystery had me on the edge of my seat.

It felt almost juvenile and overly simple in its writing. It left very little for me to appreciate. I rewatched the volume 1 content of the anime, thinking maybe I misjudged it, but it really feels like the anime crew improved on the overall writing in that bit.   My question is, as someone who has read more than me... Should I expect the LN to improve? Is there anything of value you think I could get out of the LN that the anime hasn't given so far? Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

I found the review refreshing.   Anybody looking for anything good from the three heroes will be disappointed.  If they are who you care about, you are better off reading that evil tome, ""The Reprise of the Spear Hero"".  A blatant attempt by the vile Spear Hero to rewrite history.

Have to agree with most of what was said. Not sure how Risha will work as a character but as for being incompetent, she hasn't had much of a chance to do much yet and if anything, Naofumi seemingly sidelining her is uncharacteristic and annoying.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           I think the LNs' prose has consistent issues with simplistic, repetitive sentences, delivering the same exposition multiple times in short succession, and fight scenes devolving into a dull series of people shouting ""[insert move name here!"" at each other. (This was in Japanese, so I can't speak to whether the translation did anything to smooth out the reading experience.) I like some of the ideas at play, but I don't think those aspects get enough consistent focus.   The characters aren't exactly static, but they move in fits and starts. Someone will have an arc of development and then sit around unchanged for multiple books before anything happens with them again. (And some characters, villains especially, are just always one-note.) That's partly because the cast just keeps growing, which I don't think is always a good thing. The three heroes spoiler[do eventually get redemption arcs after hitting rock bottom themselves, but it's a long time coming, and it effectively just makes them new additions to Naofumi's rotating crew of followers].   If some of the edgier bits of Naofumi's narration were bothering you, however, those basically disappear after volume 1.   I would say that the anime scriptwriters definitely made things feel more planned and consistent by adding foreshadowing, introducing setting details earlier, etc., and altering the staging of some scenes to be more dramatic. There's only one change I remember that I wouldn't call a strict improvement.   As for content, reading the LNs will give you more setting details, a slightly different timeline of events (he doesn't spoiler[become a lord] until books later, for instance), and show you some material that the anime is currently cutting, like one amusing scene with Ren and Eclair that does play into future events. Also you can read much further ahead than you can watch. More books than I'd like feel dangerously close to filler, but there are some all-right arcs if you really care, and the exposition makes skipping books fairly painless.

Or should I consider giving up on the novels and sticking to the anime? Your opinion.           From what I heard the anime improved it. A staff member or maybe the actual writer said that tv Naofumi doesn't feel like the actual Naofumi but instead the Naofumi that Raphtalia sees. Kinda similar to the writer's requests about illustrating Subaru in the Re:zero anime. I heard the novel was also more violent than the tv series with one example being two deaths from the first season being spared. Naofumi was quite edgier in the light novel while in the tv series he was rewritten to stop the execution. Hope this helps.

Though I agree that 2 episodes in, it hasn't quite roped me in as well as the previous seasons. It may be a slower build-up this time. The new girl Risha is kind of lame and I don't get the animal costumes. I don't know if expanding beyond the 4 cardinal heroes to include 7 others from some other continent or whatever is a good play. The simplicity of the 4-heroes  and then developing complexities around that would be preferable, whcih is what I initially expected, that we'd explore the other 3 guys more as the series went on...   I also don't know if the expanding cast will come at the cost of the only two characters viewers are interested in - Naofumi and Raphtalia - but those two and their relationship are what essentially made the series, so the show works best when the drama revolves around them and how they grow under developing circumstances. There was also the tragedy and conflict of the Shield Hero which made his labours and journey compelling early on as a slandered and reluctant hero who may have been the one who had to dirty his hands and reputation to accomplish things the other more pristine and celebrated heroes could not. But now that that situation was more or less solved, the show now needs something else just as compelling to keep me invested. So here's hoping we get something good.

I enjoyed the first season of Shield Hero quite a bit, but the pacing of this second one felt off and I was wondering why. Now that I know that more than half a book's content was cut, I understand what's the issue. Having this huge, epic battle happing without enough build-up left me uninvolved with what was happening on screen (I think it's also a case of bad directing with action scenes).   I hope the rest of the content this season is going to adapt won't feel as rushed, and I'll probably try reading the novels too eventually since there are some key differences with the anime from what you wrote (even in the first season).

I'm still feeling like Rishia isn't pulling her weight enough though.   Ost looks great in that China Dress. And Eclair in her armor and ponytail.   It was nice to see some of the soldiers who supported Naofumi and to see how inspiration seeing the Shield Heroes' flag was for the soldiers. Naofumi has come a long way, and just look at his face when he sees all those people looking up and admiring him.    Ost is surprisingly funny with her blunt and casual way of talking about major things ""Oh, I'm still here! I guess we didn't actually defeat the Spirit Tortoise.""

REVIEW: The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 [1/2] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," I admit I'm coming from a place of loathing the way the Shield Hero LNs structure their story (and also some elements of the writing style), but I'm very interested in where the anime is going with its adaptation choices. There were definitely a fair number of tweaks in S1, but nothing this dramatic (with maybe one exception of a major event getting moved forward multiple books).   Dialing back the number of people enslaved and playing up Naofumi's reluctance seems like they're angling to make him more sympathetic overall, although I wonder what that means for future developments involving that plot element.   While I'm on board with skipping more than half of book 6 (even if it meant losing one scene I like) in the name of getting to the action, I can't help feeling that action is still in awfully short supply. The pace these episodes are moving at makes me wonder if this season is only planned to cover through book 7, although the OP would seem to indicate otherwise.
