Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.      Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B- Art : B  + Strong sense of body language, relatable characters, heartfelt and emotional themes to liven up a familiar romantic setup − Struggles to articulate its musical elements, feels rather anticlimactic for a first volume            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Yayoi Osawa   Full encyclopedia details aboutHello, Melancholic!

Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar.

She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight. By the end of a first volume you usually want to feel like there's been at least a little bit of resolution, but very little has changed beyond Minato and Hibiki growing closer, and their first live performance looming closer. But series like these are a marathon, not a sprint, and there's plenty of charm in the small details and vibrant personalities on display here to keep you coming back. That's about all you can ask for an opening act, so here's hoping the main performance is worth the buildup.

Synopsis:             Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music.

Review:         Synopsis:        Minato Asano had one reason for picking her high school: it didn't have a concert band. Despite her life-long love of the trombone, terrible experiences through middle school left her a nervous wreck who's desperate to avoid the hierarchy of competitive music. But it seems no matter where she goes the rhythm will find her, as perky upperclassmen Hibiki Sugawa steamrolls into her life and invites Minato to join her band. Reluctant at first, Minato slowly finds herself drawn back into the world of music – and especially drawn to Hibiki herself.     Review:            Stop me if you've heard this one before: a mopey, socially anxious teenager just can't find the courage to make friends. They're kind and friendly at heart, but feel like an outcast from others who make friends much more easily. Then, out of the blue, a quirky girl their age suddenly appears to sweep them off their feet, encourage them to break out of their shell, and experience the thrills of adolescence they never believed were possible. It's about as standard a setup as you can get with this kind of coming-of-age romantic drama, and I'm certainly not going to pretend it's suddenly fresh and new just because the awkward lead in Hello, Melancholic! is also a girl. This is by and large an extremely familiar story – but that doesn't mean it can't be a good one if told well, and through this first volume, this series is a firmly charming riff on the formula.    A lot of that comes from Minato herself, and specifically how the series makes her character feel real and relatable beyond her archetypal traits. Her tall figure, uncombed mop of hair, and stiff body language make her stand out among the clean and casual cast around her, perfectly emphasizing her anxiety over attracting attention. Pretty much any time she's standing up, she's also hunched over, arms hugging into her chest as if to take up as little space as possible – there's even mention of the awkwardly fast walk that seems to be universal among clumsy nerds across the world. The only time she ever stands up straight, unashamed of her full size, is when she's lost in playing her trombone, excellently articulating how music allows her to express herself where words fail. While on a purely technical level Yayoi Ohsawa's art is fairly average, the attention to body language goes a long way in characterizing Minato and her compatriots, and making them feel real to the reader.    Which is good, because this is a comic book about music, which is a pretty challenging thing to get by in a purely visual medium, especially with the frankly eclectic makeup of Hibiki's band – drums, trombone, flute, bass, and a single member pulling triple duty on piano, saxophone, and guitar. It's an odd mix of instruments that I imagine would end up sounding like some kind of jazz fusion, but the series never really gets into the nitty and/or gritty of them composing or practicing music. About the deepest you're really going to get here is the first chapter title being a possible reference to a song by The Pillows, because otherwise music here is strictly a means of building character relationships. Band or music nerds looking for a deep dive into the particulars of high school musicians composing or practicing music should best look elsewhere.    Not that that's a bad thing – it's honestly a pretty good idea for the series, considering the limitations of its own medium. The key theme of this volume is stated outright by Hibiki in her first jam session with Minato: music is a conversation, and more important than talent or skill or precision is the desire to say something with your music. Whether it's to blend in and follow others' sounds, to experiment with your own, or to simply mix yours with others and see what happens, the important thing is that you're playing at all. For Minato, who's spent years trying to blend into the background to avoid judgment, and it's an important reminder of what makes music special to her, and sells the conceit of a band-themed romance better than any minutiae about chord structure ever could.    It's a touching sentiment that builds out into the broader hijinks the characters get into outside of their band, too. Whether they're hanging out at a restaurant, sneaking out of the house for late night band practice, or running from the cops while hauling all their gear, the key is for Minato to put herself out there with them rather than shrinking into the background out of fear. It's a simple and familiar moral, but one delivered with tons of heart and care. There are moments that border on cliché, but nonetheless capture the exuberance of doing something new for the first time, or following an impulse against your better judgment. In those pages, Hello, Melancholic! positively shines.    And while the overall plot in this first volume is sparse, we do thankfully get some insight into Hibiki's personality beyond a bright and inviting girlfriend fantasy. She's grown up with music for just as long as Minato, but her familial history has left her with a bitter distaste for competitive music, alongside a passionate desire to pursue music her own way. She's also stubborn to a fault, playing through a wrist injury that only Minato's sharp ears catch, and having to be strong-armed into laying off practices. The volume ends before we get any resolution on that – or any real development of our central relationship beyond Minato's blushy lovesickness – but it does a great deal to flesh her out as a character, to feel as real and rounded as our lead.    Still, that does leave this volume feeling a bit slight.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up?   by Matthew Roe, Apr 23rd 2022          Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.

Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do.

But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.

Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

24-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-22/paranoia-agent-how-does-it-hold-up/.184902,Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up? - Anime News Network:SEA,"    Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was.

At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors.

Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations.

Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.    Both Japanese and English voice casts are strong enough to propel their respective storylines without the need for over-intrusive musical accompaniment, and I love that. It doesn't mean I prefer musicless animation — I grew up in the '90s, you really couldn't escape music in animation if you lived in America, though I am thoroughly thankful that more and more animated movies in the US are generally breaking away from the musical. The phenomenal voicework manages to augment the natural power of each scene. I feel for these characters, and the more I learn about them, the more I empathize. I may not always like what I find in them, with a couple being outright despicable, but I always seem to find something to understand about them, due in large part to the raw emotional core of everyone's performances.    So as we wind down, how does Paranoia Agent fair all these years later? Well, considering Satoshi Kon remains my favorite animation director, you know I can be biased when approaching anything the man made. Even when I take the messy visual inconsistencies into account, as well as the slightly underwhelming musical score (again, a relative point since all of Hirasawa's soundtracks that I have experienced are anything but pedestrian), the series manages to remain just as fresh, entertaining, and thoughtful as it ever was. Unsettling ideas about humanity thrown into a blender with wry wit, vantablack humor, and a love for all things art, make Paranoia Agent something which can almost defy categorization. Sure, it won't be for every casual anime fan off the street, but I'd honestly recommend any self-identified anime fan watch this series at least twice — once really won't be good enough.    While sociologically-charged stories come around each year, wanting to say something profound about our experience here on earth, Paranoia Agent may be the one anime that managed to capture that debate, nearly perfectly. It is a series which tells its audience, ""It is never too late to correct your path and find a positive way out of your corner. We all hurt, we all experience trauma, and we all have the potential to heal.""    Thank you to everyone who's watched this video essay to the end, you make this job really worth it. I know I didn't touch on the OP and ED in this video, just wasn't able to squeeze it in with the 3700+ other words in this script, so I'll at least say that both are awesome. They give away a lot of great nuggets of the story without being overly blatant like a lot of modern opening and closing sequences. Kind of reminds me of Monster, which has one of my favorite OPs. I also did a review on that anime a while back, exploring the thriller genre, over on my personal channel Criticlysm. So you check that out.

24-04-2022,anime,8,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/watch/2022-04-22/paranoia-agent-how-does-it-hold-up/.184902,Paranoia Agent - How Does It Hold Up? - Anime News Network:SEA,"   Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe (@TheCriticlysm) heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.      What is Paranoia Agent? Is it a dark comedy with satirical social overtones? Is it a human melodrama, propelled by the lies we tell ourselves and those around us? Is it a crime drama, using sprees to dissect the generational gap and the inevitable worldly changes which we all must face? Or is it a fever dream of psycho-surreal imagery that'll either set your teeth on edge, or will seem too looney to take seriously? Well, it's all of these things.    The works of Satoshi Kon straddle the line between arthouse abstruseness and mainstream appeal. His dream-fueled visual and narrative elements are grounded through very human aspects such as isolation, loss, and how macro changes in the world impact us as individuals. He manages to transform the mundane into something spectacular, while also presenting the fantastic as a tool for discovering simple truths. And if you were already thinking it, there is something to it when people compare Kon's filmography to that of Christopher Nolan, another largely successful mainstream filmmaker who marries intellectualism and social examination with mind-bending plots and visuals.    The large significance that separates the two — that I find, anyhow — is that Nolan focuses on meticulously layering his big ideas through his narratives to a point that many of his characters are simply plot vehicles, and their interactions are just to espouse the cool concepts which Nolan wants to talk about. That isn't to say that Nolan doesn't direct his actors well, or that these characters are not written to have relatable motivations and emotional responses. Matthew McConaughey in Interstellar and Guy Pearce in Memento easily make us believe they are who they say they are. Nolan's approach to his subjects has been referred to as ""cold"" and ""distant"" — based on the calculated precision in which he extrapolates on his themes — whereas Kon is almost his inverse.    Kon's eye for storytelling involves as many big ideas as Nolan — so much so that Nolan is still called a rip-off artist in some circles because of the similarities between Paprika and Inception. However, what sets their dichotomy firmly in place is Kon's attention to emotional reality, despite the very evident unreality which infects his stories.    Kon's genius — obviously among other things — was the ability to create a vivid, thriving world (with a matching cast of characters) where minute and seemingly inconsequential elements all add up to form a magnificent final image, one that you'd rarely fully understand until the work's final moments. While Kon's movies all play with this expectation, his series Paranoia Agent is the petri dish which allowed him to fully realize an ideal marriage between surrealism, absurdism, intellectualism, and the human experience. We're given these huge ideas and comments on society, culture, and our progression as a species, while focusing on a smattering of loosely connected vignettes around a plethora of contrasting individuals.    As a result, what starts as a simple mystery surrounding a supposed mugging, evolves through family dramas and extortion rackets into an apocalyptic fever dream. So without any more preamble, let's jump through a quick synopsis before we get to the meat of this analysis.    Tsukiko Sagi, a character designer who created an immensely popular pink dog named Maromi, is walking home one night when she is attacked by an elementary school boy riding golden inline skates, and carrying a twisted metal baseball bat. The following day, the detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa are assigned to the case, and soon thereafter a series of mugging victims crop up all spouting the same story. The attacker, named Lil' Slugger by the press and gossiping public, is increasingly credited for a wave of violence snaking its way through Tokyo. However, while Ikari and Maniwa pull out every stop to track down and stop Lil' Slugger, the case becomes continually convoluted and seemingly devoid of logic — a fact which weighs heavily on the detectives, forcing them down separate paths as a means of coping. One lamenting at his loss of purpose and place within a new world he doesn't understand, and another adapting so extremely to these new times that he loses sense of the man he once was. The series concludes with typical Kon zaniness, blending reality and fantasy — you may notice that similar ideas echo in the climax of his final feature film, Paprika.    I know that this synopsis hardly scratches the surface of some of the major details which occur throughout 13 episodes, and that's kind of the point. Kon went on record, stating that Paranoia Agent was the byproduct of unused ideas which had been left over after his previous films were completed. None of these were large enough for him to turn into full stories on their own, so he took this compost heap of leftovers, and created a ""relay race"" of smaller instances where seemingly unconnected individuals are all brought together by the actions of one little mugger. Probably the best overt example of this is in the episode ""ETC,"" where a group of women gossip about increasingly ridiculous rumors surrounding Lil' Slugger, trying to constantly one-up each other while hazing the newest tenant of their building — the wife of a screenwriter, who is trying to fit in. At least, that's how it all appears when looking at its individual parts. What we end up getting is an involute character study of how people react to change, and whether ignorance is truly bliss or is fuel to a dumpster fire raging behind closed doors. Kinda reminds me a bit of Shadow of a Doubt, which is just another reason to sink your teeth into this show.    Within the initial frames of the first episode, ""Enter Lil' Slugger,"" we get a montage of people going about their day as we listen in to their conversations. We witness excuses, deflections and situational projections which ordinary people spin into their normal day without much thought as to their consequence. They range from those simply refusing to acknowledge their own part in whatever they are railing against, to those openly lying through their teeth as to their present predicaments. Whether genuine or deceptive, all in all, everyone seems to be having a pretty typical Monday. While this small sequence lasts just under two minutes, it does a considerable amount of heavy lifting. Not only does it set the tone for nearly every major plot point moving forward, as well as fully encapsulating the main themes of the series, it also works to establish a completely understandable stasis without a single character providing exposition.    The dictionary definition of ""stasis"" is a period or state of inactivity or equilibrium. In the screenwriting sense, it refers to the state of the world, both at the beginning and end of the story. With the initial stasis, we need to establish the world and rules of the narrative, and to adhere to them as we go along.    While Paranoia Agent doesn't start fully off the chain, as when the world is being swallowed by darkness, the inner and outer conversations blend into a cacophony of bruised egos, reactionary emotions, and distracted minds. It then quickly dips into a scrawl of seemingly nonsensical equations. This moment's pause introduces the characters of the crazed master, who currently resides in a hospital, and Tsukiko Sagi, on a bus on her way to work. Several small children ride by on rollerblades before the bus moves and reveals the episode title spray-painted on a wall. We know the time and place of the story, the scattershot perspectives from which the narrative will be woven together, and many subtle clues as to how this episode, and likewise the series, will approach conflict. All within two minutes, and not an info dump in sight.    Now, that isn't to say Paranoia Agent doesn't have expository scenes or dialogue. Almost every fictional narrative needs them in order to function, and we get plenty within this series. However, their use is reserved for moments like police interrogations, where a string of questions and answers is expected. But when this isn't the case, most of the characters simply speculate on what is happening, or contemplate it in solitude. Either way, Paranoia Agent relies largely on sleight-of-hand misdirections during these barrages of information, and the devil is really in the details, as the truth of each segment is buried in the minutiae. Slight tells are written across people's faces, and background details further elaborate on the situation and the relationships of those involved. As aforementioned, this series is designed around subtle details, even while the world implodes. So this time, you've got to put the laundry away and pay attention while you're watching it, otherwise you'll be even more lost than Ikari.    While every episode is strong in its own right when utilizing minuscule elements and misdirection — and I really had a hard time choosing one episode in particular to showcase this, because so many episodes are fantastic examples — where I think this really pays off is probably in Episode 10, ""Mellow Maromi,"" which follows the exploits of Naoyuki Saruta.    Throughout the episode, Saruta acts as production coordinator for a Maromi anime trying to get its first episode out the door. While this episode also acts as a great metatextual introduction to the ins and outs of anime production for anyone who wants to know about the industry, we bear witness to how one incompetant person can throw the whole production into jeopardy. Saruta cannot seem to get a solitary thing right. Among his greatest hits is losing an entire cut of the episode because he carelessly trips over a power cord, ruining a scene's background art by folding it into squares, or simply forgetting to tell people vital information about due dates, thus throwing the whole production schedule into disaster mode in order to clean up the mess. But throughout all of these events, Saruta never once claims responsibility for his very evident fault, insisting that everyone else is to blame for his actions or inaction, as the case may be. By this point in the anime, we are well acquainted with the fact that Lil' Slugger seemingly goes after individuals who consider themselves emotionally cornered and are looking for a way out. While Saruta may be overtly in denial over his complicity in his own failures, he cannot outrun the truth of the matter. Which is exactly why I believe the episode is structured as it is. The framing device of Saruta driving the tape of the first episode to the network in time for it to air that night is a fantastic pace-setter. While he keeps an eye on the clock, with only minutes to spare, he continually dozes off while driving, his dreams reliving major moments of the production.    Throughout the story, key members of the anime staff are picked off by Lil' Slugger nearly one by one, and eventually Saruta is among the only ones left. But as the work piles on for those remaining on the project, we see how violent their reactions to Saruta become — from mild irritation and exasperation, to straight-up assault seasoned with verbal abuse. As he becomes more defiant against these constant claims, his co-workers find him more and more unbearable. When he tries to vent his frustrations in a bit of a positive way, away from prying eyes, he still manages to ruin key frames of the animation because he's not paying attention to the boxes he's hitting, or that he simply doesn't care.    Though, in all honesty, by the halfway point through the episode, I was surprised he hadn't been fired. Speaking as someone who makes a living as a freelancer – I've worked on film and television sets of all sizes, in various positions, and this guy wouldn't have lasted a solitary day on the projects I've been on, especially if he were in an important leadership role like a production coordinator. But, for the sake of the vignette, I still think it works well enough to prove its point. Because the idea of Saruta's incompetence is also a projection of the other characters as well, using him as a lightning rod for other aspects of the production which can lie outside their realm of control, or because they themselves screwed the pooch. This is most notable within an earlier moment when the producer Oda is on a hunt to replace the series writer, and Saruta outs him in front of the whole crew that he had no other options because everyone notable had already turned him down.    But while the plot of this episode isn't anything strikingly unique, the manner in which we experience it absolutely is. Because Kon has such an interest in minor details building a major picture of the people we're observing, we get a lot out of the setting and scenario. We see how the appearance of each character slowly degrades over the course of the narrative as they succumb to sleeplessness and poor morale, with the backgrounds artist literally leaving a note telling people not to search for him — that he was so traumatized by the experience (whether or not it was because of Saruta or Lil' Slugger remains oblique) he's literally gone AWOL.    The whole episode is likewise shrouded by Maromi, and not just because they are working on the anime. While they have things like key chains and coffee mugs, it is when they are all gifted a ton of huggable pillows by the company responsible that things really start going downhill. The staff clearly doesn't want a thing to do with the pink dog more than they already do, with this situation being so obviously ironic because of the massive time crunch they are all currently under. While the others know there isn't going to be much sleep between them, Saruta almost immediately uses the new pillow to take a nap. As the deadline approaches, more and more Maromi merch fills cabinets, with boxes sitting atop shelves overflowing with even more lidless eyes of the omnipresent dog. Honestly, the crew probably could have side-hustled as Maromi resellers.    This overabundance of plushies — along with Maromi's little animated interludes, and repeating of the phrase ""take a rest"" in the final moments — works to enhance the uncanny valley vibes to reach critical mass by the episode's end, while also retaining the overall trajectory of the main arc. Saruta is finally fired by Oda when the color director is thinned from the crew. But if that is the case, why have we been following Saruta as he drives to the network? How'd he get a hold of the tape? Did he get rehired?    Well, the series doesn't answer those questions in a way we may initially anticipate. Maybe it's because Oda snapped his tether — murdering the final crew member as soon as the episode is finished — and when Saruta thwacks him with a bat, it was because he was trespassing in the studio so that he could steal the credit for getting the tape to the network on time. Or maybe Saruta is the murderer of the other crew members, as they all seem to disappear or violently die after some kind of altercation or interaction with him. Or maybe because that Lil' Slugger has truly been systematically killing each of these people, working his way to the one person who feels the most trapped, savoring the sweetness of the hunt like the deranged serial killer the rumors are turning him into.    There are a number of valid theories, with each one relying on different details to prove their point. Which is exactly why Paranoia Agent's many stories remain as timeless as they do. With each revisit, the characters we follow either reinforce our feelings toward them, or make us see things in a different light, depending on where we are in life. We uncover more buried tid bits which provide further context or complexity to the story, and continually are given a sickly thrilling and darkly comic journey through dreams, excuses, and paranoia. It's beautiful — in a very demented way.    While I have gushed about the narrative elements and devices for considerably longer than I had originally intended, how does the actual anime hold up on a technical level? Well, the answer is equally complicated. Kon's feature films are often a sea of rich animation, art direction, and character design, and his collaborators — most notably the brilliant screenwriter Seishi Minakami — usually manage a cohesive experience which marries the visuals to the narrative with expert allocation of their resources and craft. But with Paranoia Agent, even with his longtime partner, Studio Madhouse, backing the production, this remains the most visually inconsistent of Kon's work besides Perfect Blue. Now I'm not saying that there isn't visual splendor in either this series, or in Kon's iconic first film — far from it. What I am saying is that with Paranoia Agent, its visual experience ranges from jaw-droppingly gorgeous, to eerily creepy and atmospheric, to washed out, bland, and stiff. And while there are absolutely moments which call for particular shifts in visual language, these notable differences aren't always because of that particular intention. I normally chalk up these inconsistencies to the television format, and you can reference the ""Mellow Maromi"" episode to understand again why these shortcuts were probably taken.    Having said this, the soundscapes are solid. Sound director Masafumi Mima really hits it out of the park when needing to construct a bustling city street with an elevated train roaring by, or a small room with a character pulling down a bookcase, along with any sense of safety. Hammering at construction sites, radio feedback cutting against the whistle of passing wind, the crunch of metal as Lil' Slugger proves he ain't so little anymore — when the sound needs to hit, it certainly pulls its weight. This is compounded by the original score by Susumu Hirasawa — yup, we're back talking about his awesome musical talents yet again (see my Berserk video to get up to speed). Full of rattling cymbals and droning synths crashing against scaling background vocals and thrumming baselines, the score is dependable to get any mood across when needed. Is it as iconic as his score for the 97-98 Berserk? No. Does it have the same emotional resonance as his score for Millennium Actress, the only animated movie which has ever made me cry? No. But, like most of Kon's films, the use of score is very economical — it is only used when absolutely necessary, and is employed to maximum effect. I really appreciate that.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.      Back to top                     danpmss    Joined: 30 May 2015 		    Posts: 629       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 9:25 am            Loved his art, quite the old school sexy style. Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).

But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).

But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).

The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.     Quote:    Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).           One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

24-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/cms/discuss/184844,NEWS: Manga Creator Mio Murao Passes Away at 69 - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," Loved his art, quite the old school sexy style. Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is real golf. I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1                  How would you rate episode 3 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?                     Community score: 4.1           This is real golf. I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 21st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- ?

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible.

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers. Your tees are the scrimshawed bones of any loser who ever hit above par. You've never even seen par. You're an ornithologist of the outward nine. You clobbered the ancient mariner in the ribs and slung that albatross around your neck like a feathered boa. They'll need to invent new birds for the kinds of shots you've been sinking. This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings. It's big enough that Eve gets an overwrought sepia-toned montage in which she poses for the camera like an indie rock frontwoman staring into the distance in deep contemplation—and this all happens in episode ONE. There are no breaks on this golf train.    Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!. It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.  In fact, its strong fundamentals make its ridiculousness soar that much higher. I've been pierced by Eve's Blue Bullet, and I'm begging for more. Let the season of the golf girls commence. Fore!

It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player. It's big enough that Eve is able to support a gaggle of adorable orphans purely through her illegal winnings.

It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution. It all comes down to execution, and while Birdie Wing can't hold a candle to his directorial eye (and precious few modern anime can), the spirit remains. There's even a nod to Dezaki's trademark “postcard memory” style towards the end of the premiere, accompanied by Eve's deadpan confession that she's not a pro, she just “hit[s] a ball with a stick to make money.” I can't tell you how much I love this stupid anime.    While the premiere is a beast all on its own, the two follow-up episodes haven't been slouches either. Aoi in particular has been a fun addition and a good foil to Eve's purposeful abrasiveness. She's no less of a golf monster, but Aoi kills with her ever-effervescent kindness. This contrast extends to their playing styles too, with Eve favoring brute force daredevil drives while Aoi executes pinpoint strategic lobs. Again, the exaggeration is key here, because it transmutes golf from a plodding and esoteric experience into a blood-pumping duel between gladiators on the green. It also leads to fun moments like Aoi introducing herself and her 4-foot-long club with striking, hentai-specific framing. Meanwhile, Eve's gimmick is rainbow colored, and she can't stop talking about penetrating her opponent and/or being penetrated by her. Like any sports anime worth its salt, Eve and Aoi's rivalry is just as much a romance as anything else. I don't care if they've already heavily hinted that the two are long lost sisters. Subtext is always more powerful than text.    Furthermore, I hope the series never stops plumbing the depths of this golf-obsessed crime syndicate, and my hopes are high considering Eve made a mysterious Faustian bargain to play in the tournament against Aoi. Rose, who seems to be a rough capo in multiple senses, apparently has her own agenda, and I wouldn't trust her as far as I can chip her. My best guess right now is that she's using the tournament as a means of “advertising” Eve's existence to other golf weirdos across the globe, with the ultimate aim of using Eve as her lackey to fleece them for as much money as possible. And considering we've already seen Eve short-circuit the brain of every normal golfer she's come into contact with, it makes sense that the story would need to introduce characters who are unhinged enough to pose a challenge. This plot would also have some nice ironic synergy with Eve's immediate willingness to sell her body for a chance to golf a single round with Aoi. That really happened, and it's just one of dozens of insane things to have happened this week.    I don't know who out there was asking for an anime version of Happy Gilmore, but your prayers have somehow been answered with one of the most promising women's sports series I've watched in years. And I'm not joking. For as much as I've lauded its absurdity, Birdie Wing is a tightly written and legitimately engrossing narrative full of colorful characters and a world that just keeps expanding. It's liberally borrowing broad thematic strokes about rivalry and fulfilment from other successful sports shows and movies, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with cribbing from the classics.

I'm talking back-alley ball divot backspin beat-em-ups. This isn't your dad's golf. Take your putters and plaid pants to the municipal course and bury them and yourself six feet under the fairway. This is the sport of kings, writ in the blood of your enemies. Flay their limbs. Splay them on flagpoles like the Vlad of the sun visor. You are the lord of the links. Your wedge was tempered in Hephaestus' forge. Your driver was hewn from the trunk of Yggdrasil. Your irons are irrational numbers.

This is real golf. I'm talking quicksand traps pushing grit and shit through clenched teeth. Pull a polo shirt over your crown and paint your face with caddy entrails. You've got a sack full of wood and 18 holes to fill. Go club up and smack some balls into oblivion. You're the fell apparition that strikes fear into every pitiful soul who ever bogeyed out of a bunker. You're golfing now. God help us all.    The prior paragraph was my feeble attempt at emulating the experience of watching the premiere episode of Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story-. If you enjoyed that, read no further and give the show a whirl. I promise it's worth your time, regardless of your relationship to the sport. And if you're already caught up, or if you just want to read on anyway, then I bid you a humble welcome to the high octane world of the underground LPGA.    Birdie Wing, in a sentence, is about the electric intersection of two putting prodigies from opposing ends of the links life. One on end, we have Aoi Amawashi, born and bred into sports royalty, who represents the zenith of sheer privilege and raw talent in one witheringly chipper package. On the other end, we have Eve, an orphan who's learned to survive the mean streets by peddling her incredible athleticism against other players looking to make a quick buck in the seedy world of illegal golf betting. When these unlikely rivals meet, sparks fly, and so do the golf balls.    The anime, smartly, focuses on Eve in its opening act, because hers is by far the more ridiculous, more amusing, and more accessible story. You don't need to know anything about the rules and protocol of golf to enjoy the sight of her grinding her opponents down with drives powerful enough to shatter bone. It's hilarious, but it's only as funny as it is due to how absolutely straight the show plays it. The audience is forced to care about golf, because golf is the single most important activity in this series' world. It's big enough that Eve is outfitted with state-of-the-art spy technology in order to substitute for an injured star player.

It's a show I wish I were more familiar with (i.e. I've been dying for somebody to license it), but its impact has trickled down into everything from Gunbuster to Keijo!!!!!!!! Dezaki's trademark is his florid encapsulation of melodramatic extremes. He treats sorority drama with the same gravitas he lends to the French Revolution.

News xxxHOLiC: Rei Manga's Return Slated for Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-21 16:09 UTC-8 by Egan Loo           The print edition of the Kōshiki Comic Guide xxxHOLiC: Rei (Official Comic Guide  xxxHOLiC: Rei) book announced on Wednesday that the return of manga creator circle CLAMP's xxxHOLiC: Rei manga series is slated for next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    In an interview that Kadokawa had published in the May issue of Da Vinci magazine on April 6, CLAMP had stated that the group was still planning to continue their xxxHOLiC: Rei manga, which is currently on hiatus. CLAMP added that while they could not say (at that time) when the manga would continue, they always thought of xxxHOLiC as a work that exists ""in the background"" of other CLAMP works, and that they have been trying to write the story as the center of all interconnected CLAMP works in mind.   xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga in CLAMP's xxxHOLiC series, and it launched in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in 2013 after an initial delay. The series went on hiatus in July 2014 and returned in April 2015. The manga has since been serialized irregularly. The manga last published chapters from June 2016 to March 2017. Kodansha released the manga's third compiled book volume in October 2016.    The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.

News xxxHOLiC: Rei Manga's Return Slated for Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-21 16:09 UTC-8 by Egan Loo           The print edition of the Kōshiki Comic Guide xxxHOLiC: Rei (Official Comic Guide  xxxHOLiC: Rei) book announced on Wednesday that the return of manga creator circle CLAMP's xxxHOLiC: Rei manga series is slated for next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    In an interview that Kadokawa had published in the May issue of Da Vinci magazine on April 6, CLAMP had stated that the group was still planning to continue their xxxHOLiC: Rei manga, which is currently on hiatus. CLAMP added that while they could not say (at that time) when the manga would continue, they always thought of xxxHOLiC as a work that exists ""in the background"" of other CLAMP works, and that they have been trying to write the story as the center of all interconnected CLAMP works in mind.   xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga in CLAMP's xxxHOLiC series, and it launched in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in 2013 after an initial delay. The series went on hiatus in July 2014 and returned in April 2015. The manga has since been serialized irregularly. The manga last published chapters from June 2016 to March 2017. Kodansha released the manga's third compiled book volume in October 2016.    The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects. The manga is inspiring an upcoming live-action film that will open on April 29.

News xxxHOLiC: Rei Manga's Return Slated for Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-21 16:09 UTC-8 by Egan Loo           The print edition of the Kōshiki Comic Guide xxxHOLiC: Rei (Official Comic Guide  xxxHOLiC: Rei) book announced on Wednesday that the return of manga creator circle CLAMP's xxxHOLiC: Rei manga series is slated for next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    In an interview that Kadokawa had published in the May issue of Da Vinci magazine on April 6, CLAMP had stated that the group was still planning to continue their xxxHOLiC: Rei manga, which is currently on hiatus. CLAMP added that while they could not say (at that time) when the manga would continue, they always thought of xxxHOLiC as a work that exists ""in the background"" of other CLAMP works, and that they have been trying to write the story as the center of all interconnected CLAMP works in mind.   xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga in CLAMP's xxxHOLiC series, and it launched in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine in 2013 after an initial delay. The series went on hiatus in July 2014 and returned in April 2015. The manga has since been serialized irregularly. The manga last published chapters from June 2016 to March 2017. Kodansha released the manga's third compiled book volume in October 2016.    The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects. The manga is inspiring an upcoming live-action film that will open on April 29.

News Live-Action 'HiGH&LOW The Worst X' Sequel Film's Teaser Reveals More Cast, September 9 Opening   posted on 2022-04-21 12:51 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Yuta Nakamoto, Ryoki Miyama, Ikuya Naganuma, Suzuki Higa join cast    The official website for HiGH&LOW The Worst X (pronounced ""cross""), the sequel film to the HiGH&LOW THE WORST crossover film, unveiled a new teaser trailer and visual on Thursday. The teaser reveals the film's September 9 opening date, and the new cast members for the film.        The new cast members play the new rival team from Senomon Technical High School. They include (left to right in image above) Ikuya Naganuma as Amahisa ""Saboten"" Sabō, Ryoki Miyama as the gang leader Kōhei Amagai, NCT 127 member Yuta Nakamoto as Senomon's strongest gang member Ryō Suzaki, and Suzuki Higa as Numa Tsuda.    The sequel brings back cast members from the first film. EXILE HIRO is producing the sequel film, and Norihisa Hiranuma is returning to direct with Daisuke Ninomiya as a general director. Masaki Suzumura is the action director, and Takahito Ouchi is supervising the action. Shoichiro Masumoto, Kei Watanabe, and Hiranuma are writing the screenplay.    6 from HiGH&LOW THE WORST, the sequel series to the HiGH&LOW THE WORST crossover film, premiered on NTV in November 2020. The story centers around the six childhood friends from Kibōgaoka. Kazuma Kawamura, Jin Shirasu, Yuta Nakatsuka, Hayato Komori, Miu Tomita, and Masato Yano all reprise their roles from the film as the characters Fujio Hanaoka, Seiji Kirihara, Shinya Orochi, Masaya Orochi, Madoka Ishii, and Arata Maekawa, respectively. The story begins with these friends digging up a time capsule they buried at a nearby park 10 years ago.    Shigeaki Kubo, Hiranuma, and Daisuke Kamijō directed the series, with scripts by Crows and Worst manga creator Hiroshi Takahashi himself, Hiranuma, Shōichirō Masumoto, Kei Watanabe, and Kamijō. The series had six episodes.    The HiGH&LOW THE WORST film opened in Japan in October 2019. The movie centers on a conflict between the students of Hōsen Academy from Crows and Worst, and the students of Oya High School from HiGH&LOW. Hōsen Academy is often called a ""pack of killers,"" who are all bald except for their leader. Oya High School are one of five in the ""SWORD"" area where delinquents gather. In the film, the uneasy peace maintained by Hōsen Academy's new generation crumbles, with many gangs now seeking supremacy over one another in a new age of conflict. Ameno launched HiGH&LOW THE WORST - Hōsen Gakuen Nisshi (Hōsen Academy Log), a manga based on the film, in Akita Shoten's Monthly Shōnen Champion magazine in April 2020, and ended it in October 2020.    Takahashi's Crows manga ran for 26 volumes, and inspired a two-episode anime OVA adaptation. The manga also inspired three live-action films, with Takashi Miike directing the first two films, Crows Zero and Crows Zero II. Crows Explode, the third film, opened in Japan in April 2014. Tokyo Shock released the first film on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America, and video label MVM released both Crows Zero and Crows Zero II in the United Kingdom.    Takahashi began Worst as a continuation of his earlier Crows series in 2001, and ended it with 33 compiled volumes in 2013. The story follows a delinquent named Hana Tsukishima as he rises to the top of the gangs at the notorious Suzuran Boys' High School. A single-volume side story titled Worst Gaiden ran in Monthly Shōnen Champion in 2009. The franchise launched a new spinoff manga titled Worst Gaiden: Dokuro (Worst Side Story: Skull) in February 2019, as well as another spinoff titled Worst Gaiden: Guriko (Worst Side Story: Guriko) that launched in January 2019.    The HiGH&LOW live-action entertainment project, launched by Japanese supergroup Exile Tribe, began as a 10-episode drama series titled HiGH&LOW: The Story of S.W.O.R.D. that premiered on television and Hulu in Japan in October 2015. A second drama series titled HiGH&LOW Season 2 ran from April to June 2016. The Road to HiGH&LOW film premiered in theaters in May 2016. A second film titled HiGH&LOW The Movie premiered in theaters in July 2016, followed by the HiGH&LOW The Red Rain film, which opened in Japan in October 2016. A series of live performances titled HiGH&LOW The Live ran from July through October 2016 across Japan. HiGH&LOW The Movie 2: End of Sky opened in theaters in August 2017. The franchise's ""final chapter"" film, titled HiGH&LOW The Movie 3: Final Mission, opened in November 2017.    CLAMP launched a manga for the HiGH&LOW franchise in March 2017, and ended it in August 2017. The manga inspired a series of Flash anime.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

The Best and Worst of Winter 2022   by Daniel DeLorme, Apr  6th 2022            Let's have a look at what ANN readers consider the best (and worst) of the season, based on the polls you can find in our Daily Streaming Reviews and on the Your Score page with the latest simulcasts.   Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating.

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.

ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Weekly Ranking homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulze_method': 1}"

Keep in mind that these rankings are based on how people rated individual episodes of the current season, not on the overall quality or popularity of the series. Only the titles legally streaming in North America and popular enough are being ranked, so the bottom of the list might represent 'watchable' rather than 'bad'. See the notes for further details.   For the last week we're comparing all the final episodes With the week of March 26-31, the Winter 2022 season is now over. But many of the series already ended the previous week, so we're adding an extra ""final"" week where all the last episodes are ranked against each other. With this we can see which series ended on a strong note and which ones ended more weakly. That means the ""final ep."" column is a repeat of the last episode from Mar 19-25 or Mar 26-31. And the ""prev week change"" is the difference in position between the ""final ep."" column and the penultimate episode.  Episode Rankings for the final episodes Along the actual ranking for this week's episodes, this graph chronicles the change in position from week to week. While some series are stable, others swing wildly in the rankings depending on the strength of each episode. When a series has no episode for a given week, the previous week's episode is used instead as a placeholder. The first episode of each series is considered as part of the first week, even if it really streamed during the second week.

With the last episode duplicated in the ""final ep."" column, it means that the votes for the last episode of each series are counted twice, which intentionally gives a boost to series that ended strongly. This somewhat compensates for the fact that the first episode of each series has more votes, which favors series that started strongly.  So this is it, the final ranking, the winners and losers of the Winter 2022 season.

Platinum End  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 24          Notes  Disclaimer: the rankings are just an average of opinions, published for entertainment and information purposes. ANN makes no claims regarding statistical significance or invulnerability to spam.   The rankings are computed using the Schulze method, with the variation that unrated titles are considered as abstentions instead of lower than the rated titles. This roughly means that if, out of all people who rated both A and B, 60% preferred A, it will be ranked higher than B.   The rankings indicate relative quality (A is preferred to B), not absolute quality (B is good/bad). While the titles are ranked from 'best' to 'worst', sometimes the difference between #1 and #10 can be very thin. So if your favorite is near the bottom of the list, don't take it personally. It doesn't mean it's a bad show, it just means that ANN readers, on average, have preferred the ones above.   If a series has no episode for a given week, we use the rating data for the previous week's episode in order to compute the weekly ranking. This is not officially counted as a position in the ranking (it has no impact on the cumulative ranking), but it makes it easier to compare weeks if they each have the same number of series ranked.   It should be noted that long-running series (and sequels) have an advantage in the sense that only people who like the series are still watching it, and they are likely to give each episode a high rating. But if such a series is going through a low-quality filler arc, the season will get low rankings that are not indicative of the true overall quality of the series.
