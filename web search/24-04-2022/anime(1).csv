The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide I'm Quitting Heroing   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out.

It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either.

In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
24-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode.

Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode. Doesn't help that while some of the Generals at least sass him back, a couple of them just roll with Leo's obnoxious personality. Jokes like this one need some real friction to be funny, and that's in short supply across too much of this premiere. I'm especially not a fan of the underage beast-girl who's declared she wants to marry him. The show hasn't yet used her for obvious fanservice, but the prospect of seeing more of that is a pretty good motivator to not watch another episode.    And it didn't really need more help in that endeavor. While there's nothing particularly bad about this premiere, it also just doesn't do much that's interesting or compelling. Maybe it's the generic art style and character designs, maybe it's just the show splitting itself too much between a wacky comedy and a serious story of a banished hero joining the “dark side” –  either way, not being bad or objectionable isn't the same as being good, and I can't give much enthusiasm for a show that leaves such little impression.

24-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/im-quitting-heroing/.183521,I'm Quitting Heroing - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of I'm Quitting Heroing ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Leo is a hero who once saved the world from a demon army's invasion. However, he was feared and ostracized by people afterward, and ended up with no job. Feeling that his skills would be better appreciated elsewhere, he joins the demon lord's army that he once fought. Now in a new work environment, Leo strives to use his skills and revive the demon army that is on the brink of collapse.    I'm Quitting Heroing is based on Quantum and Hana Amano's fantasy light novel series and streams on HIDIVE on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to give I'm Quitting Heroing some credit. It's not a premise I've encountered before, which can be very valuable when it feels like half the series that come out each season are variations on the same three themes. It also gets off to a strong start, with Leo marching himself into the Demon Lord's castle and proudly presenting his resume. His blunt, arrogant, and somewhat abrasive personality kind of sucks and he knows it, but he's also confident that his skills more than make up for his social deficiencies.    With the first few minutes dedicated to some solid physical comedy and character-based gags, I was ready to lean in and accept that hey, maybe this isn't the anime for me, but it's still pretty fun. The character designs are attractive and varied without being totally hackneyed; plus, one of them has very similar energy to Iskander from Fate/Zero, and I kind of love that. By the time Leo was meeting with the Four Generals in the boardroom, I had settled in for a good, solid 3.5 star premiere. Not my thing necessarily, but a solid recommendation for people who read the summary and think it sounds like something they'd enjoy.    But then the flashbacks start. Leo talks about how he defeated each of the Four Generals while black and white depictions of what he's describing play on screen. It's half showing, half telling, all redundancy, and it really sucks all the oxygen out of the room. It's too abbreviated for any kind of decent action, but there aren't really any jokes there either. It gives us a little information about each character, but mostly shows off what kind of archetype they are, along with reiterating that Leo is really, really strong. My eyes started to glaze over but hey, at least it handled Lily's crush on Leo without being really creepy about it.    And then! And then! It slides straight into melodrama as Leo tells the Four Generals how he ended up deciding to join them in yet another gray-tinged flashback and by now I am checked out. We've gone straight from “fun romp” to “whiny slog” in the space of less than an episode, and I need someone to go out and buy me a neck brace because I am seriously suffering from tonal whiplash. It's a real galaxy-brained choice to make the first episode almost entirely backstory, and I don't mean that in the good way. It stops the story in its tracks before it can even get going. It has the stink of an overly-faithful adaptation of an under-edited light novel to it, and I'm not holding my nose for it.        James Beckett  Rating:               Watching a premiere like the one we get with I'm Quitting Heroing is like eating a Hot Pocket for dinner. You know that it isn't going to be very healthy, or filling, or even very tasty. As you spend two-to-three minutes watching the little meat-and-cheese pastry spin around on the microwave plate, secure in its patented “crispy sleeve” or whatever the hell it's called,  you will have plenty of time to ask yourself the important questions: “Is this really what I'm going to settle for?” “Surely, there must have been something better to choose from than this?” “How many years is eating this mass-produced and possibly irradiated junk food going to take off my life, anyways?” Then you eat the thing, and it's…fine. It's technically food. It contains plenty of sugars and empty calories to keep your body functioning for a few hours more. It could have been worse, probably. It could have been a Lean Pocket.    Anyways, you all know the drill with these overlong food metaphors: They indicate that the subject being reviewed is too bland and featureless to inspire much thought-provoking criticism, so the writer in question had to reach just to find an interesting way of saying that they were mildly but not offensively bored by the whole experience. Also, I'm very hungry as I'm writing this.    I didn't hate I'm Quitting Heroing. It's just that, as a generic workplace comedy twist on even more generic anime fantasy tropes, there is literally nothing about the cast or the story that we haven't seen done ten thousand times before already. The main character is named “Leo Demonheart” for crying out loud. He and all of the Demon Queen's generals look and sound like they were yanked right out of the Default Templates folder you'd find on a vanilla install of RPG Maker.    A couple of the jokes in this episode made me laugh, and at no point did the main guy behave in a way that was creepy or irritating. The episode didn't feel any longer than its 23-minute runtime (though it didn't exactly breeze by, either). So, while I didn't like anything about I'm Quitting Heroing, I didn't actively hate my time with it either. It just sort of exists, designed to be consumed and immediately forgotten, like so many of the cheap frozen dinners that have come and gone throughout the college dorms of the world.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               The premise of this series boils down to a single question: “What happens to the hero after they win?” You may want the legendary hero around when there's an army of invading demons led by an all-powerful Demon Lord, but the moment the hero is triumphant, the whole situation changes. Now you have someone powerful enough to take down the ultimate evil—without the evil part of the equation. This begets fear in the general population which then turns to anger. Soon they will want him gone—if not dead then at least out of sight and out of mind.    This is doubly true in the case of Leo who is a hero so overpowered, he single-handedly took out not only the Demon Lord's army but the Demon Lord and her four generals as well. So what does he do when he is abandoned by all those he worked to save? He sets off to join the remnants of the Demon Lord's army. After all, they will surely accept him since they've seen how effective he is—won't they?    It's a solid premise with a lot of potential for both comedy and drama. But in setting it up, this whole episode becomes little more than a giant backstory dump. We meet the Demon Lord (however briefly) and get introduced to the four generals. Each of the four are walking fantasy stereotypes but this is played for comedy by showing how easily Leo beat them by exploiting their obvious weaknesses. Normally that alone is not enough to carry the episode, but thankfully Leo himself is able to pick up the slack.    Leo is a deeply flawed person. He has ungodly amounts of power and an ego to match. Because of this, he just expects things to work out in his favor and seems more than a little confused when they don't (though he rebounds quickly). But what makes Leo interesting is the simple fact that he doesn't seem to care about anything. He doesn't care about his fellow humans or the things they hold dear. He likewise doesn't care about the demons and all the pain and suffering he has personally put them through.    He doesn't even really seem to care about himself. Even when he is exiled, he doesn't get angry or go on a killing spree like the people fear, he just kind of becomes aimless. It's not like he forgives the people for casting him aside but it seems to roll off of him like something that can't be helped. This is equal parts intriguing and unsettling. Behind the jokes, we have this mystery of a broken man and what made him become this way. And for me, that's enough to give it another watch next week.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Even if you don't admire Leo's chutzpah for waltzing into the castle of the very demon lord he just defeated and asking for a job, you have to give him credit for realizing that he was fighting on the wrong side before. This wouldn't be the first title to posit that humans are the real monsters, and while it isn't necessarily going to be expanded upon here, that line of reasoning is very much open in this first episode. That Leo, after realizing that he wasn't doing great work with a party, took it upon himself to fight Echidna the Demon Queen and her four generals, only to be completely rejected by the very humans he was fighting for after defeating them, is a good demonstration of what's wrong with the story's world. In another show, I might say that it was an indication of what's wrong with the basic narrative of good versus evil, but I honestly don't think that's what this series is going for.    What it does appear to be working towards is a simple role reversal: Leo wasn't respected as a hero, so he's going to try his luck as a villain. He knows the road will be a tricky one, seeing as how he was the instrument of the demons' defeat, but he's also tired, emotionally wounded, and really, really sick of living in a cave since he was banished from the very kingdom he saved. I wouldn't blame him if he had a serious grudge; that he doesn't appear to seems to indicate that this is going to be more of a lighthearted piece – or at least as lighthearted as it can be when there's war involved. Not that anyone seems all that keen on attacking the humans again, Leo included. In part that may be due to the drubbing the demons took, but it's just as likely to be because absolutely nobody involved has any taste for logistics. Since Leo came equipped with handouts, graphs, and a resumé, I think we can assume that planning and other logistical tasks are in his wheelhouse.    Despite all of this relatively interesting information and a decent premise, the episode is kind of dull. Most of it is Leo explaining things, both to his prospective employers and to us in the audience, and while there's some animation, it's not very exciting. Lily's constantly wagging tail is cute, and the scene where Leo returns to town after defeating Echidna has the right uncomfortable balance, but if you don't love exposition, this may be a real slog. It has potential in Leo using his skills to turn things around for the people he previously defeated, but I could see the drag of this episode turning people off.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Just off the bat, I hate this title. Sure, it's succinct enough and doesn't have an overlong subtitle, but “Heroing” is such a clunky word that just never looks right when I read it. The show itself is perfectly alright so far – maybe a little too muddled on whether it wants to take its premise seriously or treat it entirely as a farce – but overall this premiere isn't a bad sit. But that title? Terrible. Awful. My phone keeps auto-correcting it to “I'm Quitting Heroin” and I don't need that kind of mistake in my work e-mails. As protest I'm going to call this one I Quit for the rest of time.    Anyway, the actual premise of I Quit is a solid enough one, though I can't shake the feeling of having seen so many parts of it done better in other shows. I'm also just really tired of over-powered heroes wallowing in how being a LVL 99 Übermensch isn't as fun as they always thought it would be. So Leo himself is kind of a bore throughout this premiere whenever he's supposed to be taken seriously. Thankfully he's a lot more charming when he's played as an obtuse jerk who can't stop talking about how he's so much stronger than the demon army he's trying to get a job at. He's a jerk, sure, but his casual ego gives him some personality and lets him bounce off the other characters in this episode in a way that's funny more often than not.    Though there aren't really any laugh-out-loud moments in this episode, mostly because a lot of it is used for building up the same joke four or five times in a row. Yep, Leo sure is way stronger than everyone else and he totally punked out the demon generals! We definitely needed to see that gag run through the wash multiple times across the episode.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 3:16 pm            I figured Kaguya season 3 was inevitable. I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

I guess Funi VA's are going to be busier than ever. I think Alexis Tipton is in, like, 3-4 shows this season (although she was always pretty busy) and same goes for a lot of Funimation's big name VA's.

So, why now might Funi and Sony Pictures be hesitant to have more remote recording done for the premiering Spring 2022 anime simuldubs, even if it was just 2 shows? Note that I am talking about shows that are not sequel, side stories, or prequels to other shows. Not sure how much of an the idea of more union dubs would be an issue.

Because, y'know.           ? He does anime all the time. He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan. And he was just the narrator in last season's Tokusatsu parody, Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, which was an even smaller show.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether. The dubbing medium had a wonderful thing going on then the sky started to fall where every active Funimation ADR Director embraced mediocrity for their casting methods.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 3:16 pm            I figured Kaguya season 3 was inevitable. I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

I guess Funi VA's are going to be busier than ever. I think Alexis Tipton is in, like, 3-4 shows this season (although she was always pretty busy) and same goes for a lot of Funimation's big name VA's.

He's voicing characters in every major shonen right now, was just the main character in Blue Period, and still has time to take up smaller roles such as Akane in Horimiya, or Kikaku in Life Lessons with Uramichi-Oniisan. And he was just the narrator in last season's Tokusatsu parody, Miss Kuroitsu From the Monster Development Department, which was an even smaller show.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether. The dubbing medium had a wonderful thing going on then the sky started to fall where every active Funimation ADR Director embraced mediocrity for their casting methods.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.      Back to top                  MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 3:16 pm            I figured Kaguya season 3 was inevitable. I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

On one hand (and full disclosure, these were my feelings more so before I knew Aaron's vocal rest period was around 4-6 weeks rather than one or two), I think it says a lot that they weren't willing to wait given that it's a lead reprisal and it's the premiere of a new season. It would be one thing for someone filling in unexpectedly midway through, but the fact is that in the case of an actor's injury/illness, the need to have a weekly, timely simuldub outweighs just delaying it for however long is needed or even just doing a full dub drop later on in a worst case scenario.   But on the other hand, a 4-6 week break is a valid reason to have that discussion nowadays. And it's not even really a judgement call in this case (where as it would have been if it was just a much shorter break). Because I know there are issues with potentially having to divert the creative team if production was paused. Or putting too much vocal work at once on Aaron if he had to catch-up quickly after everyone else. And the fact that fans have gotten to the point where they feel entitled to get dubs fast and unfortunately that's something a company does have to take into account as much as I wish it wasn't the case. And while I think it is a very reasonable discussion to have here given it's a potentially long term issue and there's some uncertainty, it does set a precedence that just concerns me a bit.   Especially compared to past workarounds like the situation with Trina Nishimura in Deca-Dence where they paused production for weeks while her partner was hospitalized/allowed her to record in the hospital itself or delaying Black Clover for Dallas Reid's vocal rest period.   Ultimately, I hope Aaron recovers quickly, and it sounds like this was the best decision for them to give him recovery time for as long as he needs, outside of a potentially indefinite delay.

I do hope that Aaron has a good rest and I'm sure Clifford will do a good job as Miyuki until Aaron is back.

I'm not really a fan of some of the creative liberties they've taken with the dub (I'm probably the few who don't love Ian Sinclair as the narrator) but I'm happy for fans of said dub.    As for Aaron, I hope he's taking the time and rest he needs and he can safely return to Shirogane. I like Clifford, but I also think it kind of sucks that because they now seem to have a timetable of needing to churn these dubs out again at a steady rate that they had to temporarily recast one of the main characters (literally the male lead) because of a medical issue because they need this to come out. But I guess that's how it goes.    As far as Love after World Domination, I think Lindsay Seidel will be suitably adorable as Desumi, and I'm glad Anthony DiMascio is getting a major lead role and the rest of the Gelato 5 look great. Jad Saxton will probably do a great job directing it.    I guess if I was more of a pure dub fan I would appreciate the rate they're producing these again and that we have steady dubs but I kind of miss the variety and at its own pace nature of the past few season, even if I know it was because of COVID. Also kind of feel bad for the LA VA community.

One of the unintentional benefits of the last couple of years of recording was that gaps between episodes were normal enough that a delay would likely go unnoticed.  But on the other hand, actors are signing up for a period of availability, and it's not necessarily fair to them to have to wait, especially if they need to move onto other projects.  Add in that the next round of shows starts right after the last round ends, and I could see where waiting a month to start recording or having to carve out time for one character to get caught up could throw other schedules out of whack.

If this trend insists on advancing into future broadcast dub seasons I can honestly see a ton of dub fans just not watching their dub content altogether. The dubbing medium had a wonderful thing going on then the sky started to fall where every active Funimation ADR Director embraced mediocrity for their casting methods.

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    column          12 comments       This Week in Games - Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?

Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    column          12 comments       This Week in Games - Nintendo and Sega, How Could You?

News Live-Action xxxHOLiC Film Posts New Trailer Featuring Movie-Original Character Akagumo   posted on 2022-04-22 19:45 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Film opens in Japan on April 29    ASMIK Ace's official YouTube channel began streaming a video on Friday for it and Shochiku's live-action film of CLAMP's xxxHOLiC manga. The video includes clips featuring Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character, before featuring a trailer for the film.      The original xxxHOLiC manga's story follows Yuuko — a witch who grants people's wishes, but in return the person has to give up something precious — and Kimihiro Watanuki, a man who has visions. One day, Watanuki encounters Yuuko and she promises to get rid of the spirits that torment him. In return Watanuki must work in Yuuko's shop and help her grant other people's wishes.    Ryunosuke Kamiki (left in visual right) plays Kimihiro Watanuki, while Kou Shibasaki (right) plays Yuuko Ichihara.    Other cast members include:     Hokuto Matsumura as Shizuka Doumeki   Tina Tamashiro as Himawari Kunogi   Daoko as Marudashi ""Maru""   Serena Motola as Morodashi ""Moro""   Shuri as Misaki   Nanase Nishino as Nekomusume   Sakurako Ōhara as a guest who is possessed by an ayakashi   Tenchim as a customer at Yuuko's shop who wants her wish granted  Ai Hashimoto as a Zashiki-Warashi spirit in love   Riho Yoshioka as Jorо̄gumo  Hayato Isomura as Akagumo, a movie-original character    Mika Ninagawa (live-action Sakuran, Helter Skelter) is directing the film, with a script by Erika Yoshida. Keiichirō Shibuya is composing the musical soundtrack. The band SEKAI NO OWARI performs the theme song ""Habit.""    The film will open in Japan on April 29.    CLAMP serialized the original xxxHOLiC manga in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine and Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from 2003 to 2011, although it was renamed xxxHOLiC: Rō in 2009. xxxHOLiC: Rei is the latest manga, which launched in 2013 but is currently on hiatus. The manga is slated to return next spring in Kodansha's Weekly Young Magazine.    The franchise spawned an anime film, two television anime seasons, and several original video anime projects.    The manga inspired a stage play adaptation that ran in Tokyo and Kyoto in September and October.

Interest Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-Sensei Inspires Adorable Paw Brush   posted on 2022-04-22 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy           Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-sensei is no stranger to adorable merch. His latest is a paw-shaped ""Kumanofude"" brush, used here for applying makeup.     The Kumanofude is a brand of brush that originated in Hiroshima's Kumano City. Historically renowned as makers of calligraphy and art brushes, the Kumanofude's distinctively soft texture also makes for ideal makeup brushes.    Utensil maker Kiddy Land opened orders for the Nyanko-sensei paw brush in Japan through Yahoo! Shopping on Wednesday. Brushes cost 4,180 yen (approximately US$32). Kiddy Land is also reissuing previous popular Nyanko-sensei goods, such as aprons, frying pans, and mittens as part of its latest lineup.

Interest Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-Sensei Inspires Adorable Paw Brush   posted on 2022-04-22 03:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy           Natsume's Book of Friends' Nyanko-sensei is no stranger to adorable merch. His latest is a paw-shaped ""Kumanofude"" brush, used here for applying makeup.     The Kumanofude is a brand of brush that originated in Hiroshima's Kumano City. Historically renowned as makers of calligraphy and art brushes, the Kumanofude's distinctively soft texture also makes for ideal makeup brushes.    Utensil maker Kiddy Land opened orders for the Nyanko-sensei paw brush in Japan through Yahoo! Shopping on Wednesday. Brushes cost 4,180 yen (approximately US$32). Kiddy Land is also reissuing previous popular Nyanko-sensei goods, such as aprons, frying pans, and mittens as part of its latest lineup.

His latest is a paw-shaped ""Kumanofude"" brush, used here for applying makeup.     The Kumanofude is a brand of brush that originated in Hiroshima's Kumano City. Historically renowned as makers of calligraphy and art brushes, the Kumanofude's distinctively soft texture also makes for ideal makeup brushes.    Utensil maker Kiddy Land opened orders for the Nyanko-sensei paw brush in Japan through Yahoo! Shopping on Wednesday. Brushes cost 4,180 yen (approximately US$32). Kiddy Land is also reissuing previous popular Nyanko-sensei goods, such as aprons, frying pans, and mittens as part of its latest lineup.

News iCONTACT Soccer Manga's 1st Part Ends   posted on 2022-04-21 02:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          The Knight in the Area manga duo launched new manga in August 2021    This year's 21st issue of Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine published the ending of the first part of Hiroaki Igano and Kaya Tsukiyama's iCONTACT soccer manga on Wednesday. The manga's fourth compiled book volume will ship on June 17, and will be the final volume for the first part.    The manga centers on Shishi Sakurazaka, a soccer player in his third year of middle school. He has speed that puts dedicated track runners to shame, but has no talent for shooting a goal, which has led to him being an eternal benchwarmer. But one day, while playing an online soccer game, he meets a genius gamer.    Igano and Tsukiyama launched the manga in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in August 2021. Kodansha published the manga's third volume on March 17.    Igano and Tsukiyama most notable previously collaborated on The Knight in the Area, another soccer manga. That manga launched in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in 2006, and ended in 2017. Kodansha published the manga's 57th and final compiled book volume in 2017. The spinoff manga Area no Kishi Bangai-hen: Enokō Early Days about the high school days of Coach Iwaki debuted in 2007, and Kodansha's Manga Box app released the series. The original manga also inspired a four-panel gag comedy manga. A television anime adaptation premiered in 2012, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.    Tsukiyama and Igano also collaborated on the Kami-sama no Koibito manga, which launched in March 2019, and ended in February 2020.    Igano's other pseudonyms include Yuya Aoki (GetBackers), Tadashi Agi (The Drops of God), Ryō Ryūmon (Bloody Monday), Seimaru Amagi (Kindaichi Case Files original idea), and Yuma Ando (Psychometrer, Psychometrer Eiji, Sherlock Bones).

News iCONTACT Soccer Manga's 1st Part Ends   posted on 2022-04-21 02:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          The Knight in the Area manga duo launched new manga in August 2021    This year's 21st issue of Kodansha's Weekly Shōnen Magazine published the ending of the first part of Hiroaki Igano and Kaya Tsukiyama's iCONTACT soccer manga on Wednesday. The manga's fourth compiled book volume will ship on June 17, and will be the final volume for the first part.    The manga centers on Shishi Sakurazaka, a soccer player in his third year of middle school. He has speed that puts dedicated track runners to shame, but has no talent for shooting a goal, which has led to him being an eternal benchwarmer. But one day, while playing an online soccer game, he meets a genius gamer.    Igano and Tsukiyama launched the manga in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in August 2021. Kodansha published the manga's third volume on March 17.    Igano and Tsukiyama most notable previously collaborated on The Knight in the Area, another soccer manga. That manga launched in Weekly Shōnen Magazine in 2006, and ended in 2017. Kodansha published the manga's 57th and final compiled book volume in 2017. The spinoff manga Area no Kishi Bangai-hen: Enokō Early Days about the high school days of Coach Iwaki debuted in 2007, and Kodansha's Manga Box app released the series. The original manga also inspired a four-panel gag comedy manga. A television anime adaptation premiered in 2012, and Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired.    Tsukiyama and Igano also collaborated on the Kami-sama no Koibito manga, which launched in March 2019, and ended in February 2020.    Igano's other pseudonyms include Yuya Aoki (GetBackers), Tadashi Agi (The Drops of God), Ryō Ryūmon (Bloody Monday), Seimaru Amagi (Kindaichi Case Files original idea), and Yuma Ando (Psychometrer, Psychometrer Eiji, Sherlock Bones).

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ingram-73542921/': 1}"

It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them.

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line.

Interest 2nd Bubble Making-Of Video Highlights the Attack on Titan Connection   posted on 2022-04-22 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Both anime use parkour as a reference for their action scenes    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming its second staff interview video on Wednesday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. In the ""Action Section"" video, director Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) and producer Genki Kawamura (your name., BELLE) commented on how they developed the parkour-inspired action, while also highlighting the Attack on Titan connection.      According to Araki, Bubble and Attack on Titan are alike in that they both use parkour as a reference for their action scenes. He said that his previous exposure to the athletic discipline inspired him to create something based entirely around it, so he consulted with a professional parkour athlete, Zen, for Bubble's choreography.    Zen pointed out some specific things about the characters that are expressed visually: Uta has naturalistic movements like a graceful animal, while Hibiki has very controlled movements that express his persistent efforts. Kawamura said that he couldn't think of a better director than Araki to express the relationship between characters through the physicality of their movements.    Other tidbits from the interview: Araki told Hibiki's voice actor Jun Shison to act naturalistically, and he was given the room to put down his mic and move his entire body. For Uta's voice actress Riria., the idea was that the singer's debut as a voice actress would complement the character's newfound discovery of what it is like to be human.    In the first making-of video, Araki and Kawamura explained how they developed the plot and assembled the film's ""star"" creative team.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.

Interest 2nd Bubble Making-Of Video Highlights the Attack on Titan Connection   posted on 2022-04-22 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Both anime use parkour as a reference for their action scenes    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming its second staff interview video on Wednesday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. In the ""Action Section"" video, director Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) and producer Genki Kawamura (your name., BELLE) commented on how they developed the parkour-inspired action, while also highlighting the Attack on Titan connection.      According to Araki, Bubble and Attack on Titan are alike in that they both use parkour as a reference for their action scenes. He said that his previous exposure to the athletic discipline inspired him to create something based entirely around it, so he consulted with a professional parkour athlete, Zen, for Bubble's choreography.    Zen pointed out some specific things about the characters that are expressed visually: Uta has naturalistic movements like a graceful animal, while Hibiki has very controlled movements that express his persistent efforts. Kawamura said that he couldn't think of a better director than Araki to express the relationship between characters through the physicality of their movements.    Other tidbits from the interview: Araki told Hibiki's voice actor Jun Shison to act naturalistically, and he was given the room to put down his mic and move his entire body. For Uta's voice actress Riria., the idea was that the singer's debut as a voice actress would complement the character's newfound discovery of what it is like to be human.    In the first making-of video, Araki and Kawamura explained how they developed the plot and assembled the film's ""star"" creative team.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.

Interest 2nd Bubble Making-Of Video Highlights the Attack on Titan Connection   posted on 2022-04-22 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Both anime use parkour as a reference for their action scenes    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming its second staff interview video on Wednesday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. In the ""Action Section"" video, director Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) and producer Genki Kawamura (your name., BELLE) commented on how they developed the parkour-inspired action, while also highlighting the Attack on Titan connection.      According to Araki, Bubble and Attack on Titan are alike in that they both use parkour as a reference for their action scenes. He said that his previous exposure to the athletic discipline inspired him to create something based entirely around it, so he consulted with a professional parkour athlete, Zen, for Bubble's choreography.    Zen pointed out some specific things about the characters that are expressed visually: Uta has naturalistic movements like a graceful animal, while Hibiki has very controlled movements that express his persistent efforts. Kawamura said that he couldn't think of a better director than Araki to express the relationship between characters through the physicality of their movements.    Other tidbits from the interview: Araki told Hibiki's voice actor Jun Shison to act naturalistically, and he was given the room to put down his mic and move his entire body. For Uta's voice actress Riria., the idea was that the singer's debut as a voice actress would complement the character's newfound discovery of what it is like to be human.    In the first making-of video, Araki and Kawamura explained how they developed the plot and assembled the film's ""star"" creative team.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.

Interest 2nd Bubble Making-Of Video Highlights the Attack on Titan Connection   posted on 2022-04-22 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy         Both anime use parkour as a reference for their action scenes    Warner Bros. Japan began streaming its second staff interview video on Wednesday for Bubble, the new original anime film by Wit Studio. In the ""Action Section"" video, director Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) and producer Genki Kawamura (your name., BELLE) commented on how they developed the parkour-inspired action, while also highlighting the Attack on Titan connection.      According to Araki, Bubble and Attack on Titan are alike in that they both use parkour as a reference for their action scenes. He said that his previous exposure to the athletic discipline inspired him to create something based entirely around it, so he consulted with a professional parkour athlete, Zen, for Bubble's choreography.    Zen pointed out some specific things about the characters that are expressed visually: Uta has naturalistic movements like a graceful animal, while Hibiki has very controlled movements that express his persistent efforts. Kawamura said that he couldn't think of a better director than Araki to express the relationship between characters through the physicality of their movements.    Other tidbits from the interview: Araki told Hibiki's voice actor Jun Shison to act naturalistically, and he was given the room to put down his mic and move his entire body. For Uta's voice actress Riria., the idea was that the singer's debut as a voice actress would complement the character's newfound discovery of what it is like to be human.    In the first making-of video, Araki and Kawamura explained how they developed the plot and assembled the film's ""star"" creative team.    Tetsuro Araki (Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress) is directing the film at Wit Studio, with a script by Gen Urobuchi (Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero novel, Psycho-Pass), and character designs by Takeshi Obata (Death Note, Platinum End). Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, 86) is composing the music.    The film will debut worldwide on Netflix on April 28, and will open in Japanese theaters on May 13. The film played as an official selection of the Generation 14plus section at the 72nd Berlin International Film Festival on February 10-20.

News Guilty Gear -Strive- Game's 'Another Story' DLC Launches on April 29   posted on 2022-04-23 04:20 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         DLC launches for season pass 1 holders    Arc System Works announced on Friday that it will launch the new ""Another Story"" DLC story for its Guilty Gear -Strive- fighting game on April 29. The game will launch for season pass 1 holders on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam.     The DLC will feature characters that did not appear in the main story.    The company describes the DLC:  While the incident in America triggered by Asuka R. Kreutz's surrender unfolds…   Special Brigade Commander Ramlethal Valentine heads to the outskirts of Illyria after receiving report of an emergency.    There she finds a girl who closely resembles “Bedman”, who once worked with the Universal Will against mankind.    The company also describes the new character Delilah (pictured above):  A young girl who has awoken from a long slumber.She's lived within a dream since her birth due to a unique condition caused by her brain's inability to withstand her exceptional intellect and abilities.As she's only just woken up, she doesn't have a solid grasp on common sense and social skills. Her one and only motive is to get revenge for her brother's life.  The game launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in June 2021, delayed from April 2021. Arc System Works previously delayed the release of the game from late 2020 due to the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Daisuke Ishiwatari is the game's general director, and Akira Katano is directing the game. The game's initial roster includes Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, May, Axl Low, Chipp Zanuff, Potemkin, Faust, Millia Rage, Zato-1, Ramlethal, Leo Whitefang, Nagoriyuki, Giovanna, Anji, and I-NO. The game's first DLC character Goldlewis Dickinson launched in July 2021. The second DLC character Jack O' launched last August. The third DLC character Happy Chaos launched on November 30 along with the game's new “Room Customization” feature. The fourth DLC character Baiken launched on January 28 along with the game's free ""Combo Maker"" update and an additional Battle Stage. The fifth DLC character Testament launched with the game's free ""Digital Figure Mode"" on March 28.    The first season pass of the game features five new characters, five colors for each character, two stages, and an extra story.     The game's ""Season 2"" DLC is in development and will include 4 additional characters.

News Guilty Gear -Strive- Game's 'Another Story' DLC Launches on April 29   posted on 2022-04-23 04:20 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         DLC launches for season pass 1 holders    Arc System Works announced on Friday that it will launch the new ""Another Story"" DLC story for its Guilty Gear -Strive- fighting game on April 29. The game will launch for season pass 1 holders on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam.     The DLC will feature characters that did not appear in the main story.    The company describes the DLC:  While the incident in America triggered by Asuka R. Kreutz's surrender unfolds…   Special Brigade Commander Ramlethal Valentine heads to the outskirts of Illyria after receiving report of an emergency.    There she finds a girl who closely resembles “Bedman”, who once worked with the Universal Will against mankind.    The company also describes the new character Delilah (pictured above):  A young girl who has awoken from a long slumber.She's lived within a dream since her birth due to a unique condition caused by her brain's inability to withstand her exceptional intellect and abilities.As she's only just woken up, she doesn't have a solid grasp on common sense and social skills. Her one and only motive is to get revenge for her brother's life.  The game launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in June 2021, delayed from April 2021. Arc System Works previously delayed the release of the game from late 2020 due to the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).    Daisuke Ishiwatari is the game's general director, and Akira Katano is directing the game. The game's initial roster includes Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, May, Axl Low, Chipp Zanuff, Potemkin, Faust, Millia Rage, Zato-1, Ramlethal, Leo Whitefang, Nagoriyuki, Giovanna, Anji, and I-NO. The game's first DLC character Goldlewis Dickinson launched in July 2021. The second DLC character Jack O' launched last August. The third DLC character Happy Chaos launched on November 30 along with the game's new “Room Customization” feature. The fourth DLC character Baiken launched on January 28 along with the game's free ""Combo Maker"" update and an additional Battle Stage. The fifth DLC character Testament launched with the game's free ""Digital Figure Mode"" on March 28.    The first season pass of the game features five new characters, five colors for each character, two stages, and an extra story.     The game's ""Season 2"" DLC is in development and will include 4 additional characters.
