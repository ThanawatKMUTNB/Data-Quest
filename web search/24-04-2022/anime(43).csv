News Even if Tempest Switch Game Launches on June 9   posted on 2022-04-24 14:53 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Visual novel developer Voltage streams new promotional trailer for game    The official website for the even if Tempest visual novel announced on Tuesday that the game will launch for Nintendo Switch digitally on June 9. Visual novel developer Voltage began streaming a promotional trailer for the game on its YouTube channel on Wednesday.      The game will be Voltage's first original release for Switch. The release will include both Japanese and English text. Voltage describes the game:    In a world where witch trials and witch hunts are commonplace.   Though born the daughter of a marquess, the heroine suffers physical and spiritual violence at the hands of her stepmother day in and day out. In the midst of her suffering, a witch offers her a terrific power.    The Fatal Rewind.    Through death, she can go back in time. And though she succeeds in changing her life, she invites upon herself an even greater tragedy.    The curtain rises on the Carnival, and this witch trial shall herald the end.   Ayane Ushio (Norn9) is directing the game and writing the scenario. Norita (Runlimit) is drawing the illustrations. Minoru Akiba is drawing the background art. Shunsuke Tsuchiya (Another Eden) is composing the soundtrack. Shihoko Hirata is performing the game's theme song.    The game will be fully voiced (excluding the heroine), and stars: Shōya Chiba, Yu-ki Fujisawa, Makoto Furukawa, Tasuku Hatanaka, Naomi Iida, Kaito Ishikawa, Yuichi Jose, Tetsuya Kakihara, Ryūichi Kijima, Suzuko Mimori, Sho Nogami, Natsume Oki, Noriaki Sugiyama, Shunsuke Takeuchi, and Hiroyuki Tsunakawa.

News Even if Tempest Switch Game Launches on June 9   posted on 2022-04-24 14:53 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         Visual novel developer Voltage streams new promotional trailer for game    The official website for the even if Tempest visual novel announced on Tuesday that the game will launch for Nintendo Switch digitally on June 9. Visual novel developer Voltage began streaming a promotional trailer for the game on its YouTube channel on Wednesday.      The game will be Voltage's first original release for Switch. The release will include both Japanese and English text. Voltage describes the game:    In a world where witch trials and witch hunts are commonplace.   Though born the daughter of a marquess, the heroine suffers physical and spiritual violence at the hands of her stepmother day in and day out. In the midst of her suffering, a witch offers her a terrific power.    The Fatal Rewind.    Through death, she can go back in time. And though she succeeds in changing her life, she invites upon herself an even greater tragedy.    The curtain rises on the Carnival, and this witch trial shall herald the end.   Ayane Ushio (Norn9) is directing the game and writing the scenario. Norita (Runlimit) is drawing the illustrations. Minoru Akiba is drawing the background art. Shunsuke Tsuchiya (Another Eden) is composing the soundtrack. Shihoko Hirata is performing the game's theme song.    The game will be fully voiced (excluding the heroine), and stars: Shōya Chiba, Yu-ki Fujisawa, Makoto Furukawa, Tasuku Hatanaka, Naomi Iida, Kaito Ishikawa, Yuichi Jose, Tetsuya Kakihara, Ryūichi Kijima, Suzuko Mimori, Sho Nogami, Natsume Oki, Noriaki Sugiyama, Shunsuke Takeuchi, and Hiroyuki Tsunakawa.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?

Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?

That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan. I blame my obsession for Ranma 1/2 back then (which honestly, wasn't really much of an ecchi thing, much more of a battle shounen parody with romcom and nudity usually played for comedy) haha     Quote:      I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

I haven't read Tokimeki no Jin yet, but the other early 80s romcoms I've mentioned before were rather generic in my opinion and nowhere as good as those by Adachi Mitsuru or Rumiko Takahashi. The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.

One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

Read my fair share of old school manga while researching the history of ecchi manga in Japan.

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.   I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.

The whole plot device in Kekkon Game for example is a high schooler who starts living together with his crush, his new homeroom teacher, because she turns out to be his fiancee, and now he has to keep that a secret at school. How many times have we seen and read tropes like that? More than we can count, I guess. Nevertheless, I was fascinated to find such ""old"" manga back in the late 90s in Japan and I couldn't resist to buy them, just to have a glimpse in early 80s shounen romcoms besides the most well-known ones.             These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

These shortcomings have hit shounen manga harder than the other demographics back then. A lot of shoujo manga were surprisingly mature and realistic despite overdramatic, and the demographic was rather indistinguishable from seinen manga at one point (while shounen was basically some sort of an evolution from Tezuka's manga for children rather than his adult works, then deconstructed by Nagai's own influence into over-the-top sexual display (the problematic Harenchi Gakuen for starters) and hyper violence, which as it escalates later on with Hokuto no Ken and alike, it also became a problem, and are not exactly the mature counterpart one would expect from the demographic), which already had a bigger variety of subjects and also usually much better developed bildungsroman stories than it, since much earlier.   In the case of shounen romcoms, they were very new and rough around the edges for the most part, even ones that aged like wine are not exactly free from some usual storytelling shortcomings.    Adachi and Rumiko were actually not-as-derivative golden standards to this day despite that (Adachi breaking the shounen mold with a ""herbivore kind of protagonist"", probably the first of the many that came after in the harem genre particularly, compared to the ongoing theme of manliness that shounen has had since Ashita no Joe and Ring ni Kakero, which were usually quite the contrast lol).    The 80s shounen romcoms (something that we didn't really have before just then, except maybe some obscure Tezuka manga or Urusei Yatsura before it actually applied, in the late 70s) are what actually started a bigger interest in shounen manga that have more sentimentality (taken notes from shoujo manga), like your other great example, Hatsukoi Scandal, and case in point, Mio Murao's manga works (which actually were also on the ecchi side, which made them extra unique).     Quote:      One author of an early 80s romcom, who definitely had that sentimental touch in his writing you're describing, was Akira Ôze with Hatsukoi Scandal.   Interestingly enough, one of Murao's earliest shounen romcoms was called Kimagure my Road. There is no way Izumi Matsumoto wasn't influenced by Murao in some way or another.       That one is likely one of the earliest examples of romcom in shounen manga, much like Murao's early works (but as I said above, what impresses me the most is that even before Orange Road, he already had ecchi works that had that sort of sentimentality applied to them, in a sea of souless unidimensional riské mangas, and applying some genuine sentimentality to many of those ecchi works, which is actually rare even nowadays).    But I must say I actually was not aware of Murao's Kimagure my Road, depending on how it goes, that would explain a whole lot, considering how many right notes I've seen Orange Road take from his early manga works, I will definitely check it whenever I can.     Quote:      I totally agree, it's a shame that he passed away. He was a very prolific author and virtually unknown outside Japan.            I'm just sad that considering how many 80s romcoms got translated in several countries, his were never considered as far as I'm concerned in the West.

They have been part of my collection ever since, like a dozen manga by Azuma Hideo, another important creator who passed away at age 69 a few years ago.  Rest in peace, Murao-sensei.

Circle Game is severely underappreciated, despite being one of his longest manga series (behind only ""S to M"" iirc, which was a big reason for me to even attempt a 69 joke). His works never got anime adaptations, and the ones that did get adaptations at all, were usually movies or mini TV series, likely the reason he is rather unknown outside Japan.   He was an author that actually used ecchi in a rather ""classier"" way, with a focus on a more sentimental note with the character's interactions, instead of the usual unidimensional fap-bait 70s to early 90s ecchi manga used to be like (a particularly infamous one as per today's standards would be Maicching Machiko-sensei, which is from where the whole ""sexual assault as a funny prank"" trope people complained in series like Mushoku Tensei, came from), and that's considering a lot of those were also romcom manga with a rather brainless plot (like Cash Boy).   When it came to ecchi in his shounen manga series he sure was very light on them though, unlike for example Go Nagai, which around the time Mio was starting his long-running publishing, was pumping out stuff like the rape-y Hanappe Bazooka. It wasn't even close to the likes of the pervert voyeur Oh! Toumei Ningen manga either.   For starters, while Tokimeki no Jin still had the more generic characterization manga in the early 80s usually had, even as early as that (his first weekly serialization), you could already see some rather avant-garde chemistry from the cast than what you would usually get in romcom, at least as far as shounen manga went (those were more in the lines of shoujo manga of the time, except without the overdramatic embelishment those used to have, courtesy of Rose of Versailles, for better and for worst).   In short, he was sort of an early Rumiko Takahashi figure when it came to sexy shounen rom-coms... though in Rumiko's case, the sentimental writing would only really come around from Maison Ikkoku (her monthly seinen manga published at the same time from 1980 onwards, which also had quite a few shoujo elements integrated in terms of character interactions) a few years later, Urusei Yatsura was more of a cynical comedy with ""romance"" sprinkled here and there for a while.   Naturally, Mio Murau was overshadowed by Orange Road, much like most other non-Rumiko shounen romcoms and copycats it gathered since, despite him arguably, possibly having been a positive influence on it and Urusei Yatsura alike (which despite starting in the late 70s, only really got itself going with proper characterization later, and not the same sort as the more mature one from Maison Ikkoku).   Anyway, a shame such a big name left us, and most people outside Japan won't even know much about him (except for maybe some few scanlations of some of his manga series, like aforementioned Cash Boy).

News Nintendo of America Responds After Worker Files Labor Complaint   posted on 2022-04-23 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anonymous employee accused Nintendo of concerted activities, coercive actions, discharge, surveillance    Nintendo of America responded in a statement to news website Kotaku on Thursday after an anonymous employee filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in Redmond, Washington against Nintendo and contracting company Aston Carter on April 15. The complaint accuses Nintendo and Aston Carter of ""concerted activities,"" discharge, surveillance, and making ""coercive actions"" against an employee - interfering with their right to unionize - within the past six months.    Nintendo's response reads:   ""We are aware of the claim, which was filed with the National Labor Relations Board by a contractor who was previously terminated for the disclosure of confidential information and for no other reason. Nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the NLRB.   Nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for all our employees and contractors. We take matters of employment very seriously.""

News Nintendo of America Responds After Worker Files Labor Complaint   posted on 2022-04-23 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anonymous employee accused Nintendo of concerted activities, coercive actions, discharge, surveillance    Nintendo of America responded in a statement to news website Kotaku on Thursday after an anonymous employee filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in Redmond, Washington against Nintendo and contracting company Aston Carter on April 15. The complaint accuses Nintendo and Aston Carter of ""concerted activities,"" discharge, surveillance, and making ""coercive actions"" against an employee - interfering with their right to unionize - within the past six months.    Nintendo's response reads:   ""We are aware of the claim, which was filed with the National Labor Relations Board by a contractor who was previously terminated for the disclosure of confidential information and for no other reason. Nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the NLRB.   Nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for all our employees and contractors. We take matters of employment very seriously.""

News Nintendo of America Responds After Worker Files Labor Complaint   posted on 2022-04-23 01:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anonymous employee accused Nintendo of concerted activities, coercive actions, discharge, surveillance    Nintendo of America responded in a statement to news website Kotaku on Thursday after an anonymous employee filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board in Redmond, Washington against Nintendo and contracting company Aston Carter on April 15. The complaint accuses Nintendo and Aston Carter of ""concerted activities,"" discharge, surveillance, and making ""coercive actions"" against an employee - interfering with their right to unionize - within the past six months.    Nintendo's response reads:   ""We are aware of the claim, which was filed with the National Labor Relations Board by a contractor who was previously terminated for the disclosure of confidential information and for no other reason. Nintendo is not aware of any attempts to unionize or related activity and intends to cooperate with the investigation conducted by the NLRB.   Nintendo is fully committed to providing a welcoming and supportive work environment for all our employees and contractors. We take matters of employment very seriously.""   Aston Carter is a staffing agency that has recruited customer service and administrative contractors for Nintendo.    Nintendo of America recently closed its offices in Redwood City, California and Toronto, Ontario in November. Kotaku reported that according to its sources, Nintendo's California office closing displaced about 100 employees.    The hybrid home and handheld console debuted on March 3, 2017. Nintendo released the new OLED model of its Nintendo Switch console on October 8. As of February, Nintendo has moved a total of 103.54 million Switch units worldwide, surpassing the Nintendo Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Game Boy Advance's lifetime numbers.

News Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   posted on 2022-04-24 11:01 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures     The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.      Takashi Matsuyama will play the character Ace in the anime. The character is unvoiced in the game.    Yuki Watanabe is directing the anime at Yostar Pictures, with Masataka Nishikawa as assistant director. Both have previously worked on the smartphone game's ""Holy Knight Light"" first anniversary anime short, and Watanabe has worked on the game's numerous animated promotional video shorts. Aya Takafuji (key animator for Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, SSSS.Gridman) is adapting the character designs for animation.    Yostar Pictures described the anime as a ""season one"" when it announced the show in October 2021.    Chinese developers Studio Montagne and Hypergryph released the game in China in May 2019, and then Yostar launched the game worldwide in January 2020. The game already inspired several animated promotional videos since 2019 and a nine-minute animated ""Holy Knight Light"" short in December 2021 to mark the game's first anniversary.    The game is set in a fantasy world called Terra with modern science-fiction motifs. Terra is plagued by rare but devastating Catastrophes that force most people to live in nomadic cities. Catastrophes also bring forth the rare mineral Originium, which yields high energy and is thus a valuable resource, but also consumes everything around it as it grows. Those with prolonged exposure to Originium easily develop a wasting disease known as Oripathy. The story centers around the lives of Oripathy-infected individuals. A roving medical company known as Rhodes Island offers a helping hand and a place to belong for the often-shunned Infected. However, Rhodes Island has often had to conduct ad-hoc paramilitary actions against the Reunion Movement, a terrorist organization that conducts violent action aimed at governments that oppress the Infected.

News Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   posted on 2022-04-24 11:01 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures     The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.      Takashi Matsuyama will play the character Ace in the anime. The character is unvoiced in the game.    Yuki Watanabe is directing the anime at Yostar Pictures, with Masataka Nishikawa as assistant director. Both have previously worked on the smartphone game's ""Holy Knight Light"" first anniversary anime short, and Watanabe has worked on the game's numerous animated promotional video shorts. Aya Takafuji (key animator for Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, SSSS.Gridman) is adapting the character designs for animation.    Yostar Pictures described the anime as a ""season one"" when it announced the show in October 2021.    Chinese developers Studio Montagne and Hypergryph released the game in China in May 2019, and then Yostar launched the game worldwide in January 2020. The game already inspired several animated promotional videos since 2019 and a nine-minute animated ""Holy Knight Light"" short in December 2021 to mark the game's first anniversary.    The game is set in a fantasy world called Terra with modern science-fiction motifs. Terra is plagued by rare but devastating Catastrophes that force most people to live in nomadic cities. Catastrophes also bring forth the rare mineral Originium, which yields high energy and is thus a valuable resource, but also consumes everything around it as it grows. Those with prolonged exposure to Originium easily develop a wasting disease known as Oripathy. The story centers around the lives of Oripathy-infected individuals. A roving medical company known as Rhodes Island offers a helping hand and a place to belong for the often-shunned Infected. However, Rhodes Island has often had to conduct ad-hoc paramilitary actions against the Reunion Movement, a terrorist organization that conducts violent action aimed at governments that oppress the Infected.

News Arknights: Prelude to Dawn TV Anime's Teaser Promo Video Streamed   posted on 2022-04-24 11:01 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins          Takashi Matsuyama stars in anime at Yostar Pictures     The official website for Arknights: Prelude to Dawn, the television anime adaptation of the Arknights smartphone game, began streaming a teaser video for the anime on Saturday.      Takashi Matsuyama will play the character Ace in the anime. The character is unvoiced in the game.    Yuki Watanabe is directing the anime at Yostar Pictures, with Masataka Nishikawa as assistant director. Both have previously worked on the smartphone game's ""Holy Knight Light"" first anniversary anime short, and Watanabe has worked on the game's numerous animated promotional video shorts. Aya Takafuji (key animator for Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia, SSSS.Gridman) is adapting the character designs for animation.    Yostar Pictures described the anime as a ""season one"" when it announced the show in October 2021.    Chinese developers Studio Montagne and Hypergryph released the game in China in May 2019, and then Yostar launched the game worldwide in January 2020. The game already inspired several animated promotional videos since 2019 and a nine-minute animated ""Holy Knight Light"" short in December 2021 to mark the game's first anniversary.    The game is set in a fantasy world called Terra with modern science-fiction motifs. Terra is plagued by rare but devastating Catastrophes that force most people to live in nomadic cities. Catastrophes also bring forth the rare mineral Originium, which yields high energy and is thus a valuable resource, but also consumes everything around it as it grows. Those with prolonged exposure to Originium easily develop a wasting disease known as Oripathy. The story centers around the lives of Oripathy-infected individuals. A roving medical company known as Rhodes Island offers a helping hand and a place to belong for the often-shunned Infected. However, Rhodes Island has often had to conduct ad-hoc paramilitary actions against the Reunion Movement, a terrorist organization that conducts violent action aimed at governments that oppress the Infected.

Catastrophes also bring forth the rare mineral Originium, which yields high energy and is thus a valuable resource, but also consumes everything around it as it grows. Those with prolonged exposure to Originium easily develop a wasting disease known as Oripathy. The story centers around the lives of Oripathy-infected individuals. A roving medical company known as Rhodes Island offers a helping hand and a place to belong for the often-shunned Infected. However, Rhodes Island has often had to conduct ad-hoc paramilitary actions against the Reunion Movement, a terrorist organization that conducts violent action aimed at governments that oppress the Infected.

The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Funimation's best strength was their ability to play loose with the script and have the dialogue more accessible to an American audience.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Is that still the case or have the scripts become more literal? I ask because I would be deeply saddened if English Dubbed anime lost something that, when done right, can make a dub truly shine.   This might just be me having an ""Okay Boomer"" moment though. I haven't watched any recent dubs (like, none from the last two years I'd say) so I'm just making assumptions.           I feel like I'm a weird guy where I don't really need a script to be loose or accessible so long as it's true to the source and the characters and the VA's are well-cast/directed well.            You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles. Its nice to see Houston voice actress Chelsea McCurdy in her first official Funimation dub I suppose as well.

Funimation's best strength was their ability to play loose with the script and have the dialogue more accessible to an American audience.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

You're not alone. I've long disliked FUNimation's dubs, primarily because I never thought the quality of their dialogue, adaptation choices, or directing were very good (there's also a weird uniformity/blandness to the way their actors often sound, but given how I've heard many of them elsewhere, I'm suspecting its more of a direction thing). You can have a faithful script and it still be perfectly understandable and good, but something like Bang Zoom/Alex Von David's Kill la Kill dub outdid FUNi at their own game: an adaptation very loose, but very well-written and still faithful (in wording and spirit) to the original. Sometimes, as well, FUNi's dubs can sound like a ""fantasy camp"" or a vehicle for the script writer and their own dreams of being a writer for their very own show.

Its a travesty to think how truly sub par and predictable the casting as been from every ADR Director working this dub season from the Dallas/Ft. Worth area. I always loved the Texas dubbing talent pool but I'm not going to get excited or have much interest in seeing voice actors like Travis Mullenix or Joe Cucinotti on display. These guys are about as unremarkable as voice actors can become in terms of vocal presence and acting ability. The only real positive here is seeing Jeremy Inman pushing the up and coming Josh Putnam into more roles.

I'm just hoping this doesn't make life more...                    column          40 comments       Shelf Life - Angel Cop   2018 Oct 15, 23:00 40 comments                 anime    This cyberpunk '80s OVA may be nostalgic for some fans, but it's hardly angelic.

I'm just hoping this doesn't make life more...                    column          40 comments       Shelf Life - Angel Cop   2018 Oct 15, 23:00 40 comments                 anime    This cyberpunk '80s OVA may be nostalgic for some fans, but it's hardly angelic.

That actually happened to me ...                    column          14 comments       Shelf Life - Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!
