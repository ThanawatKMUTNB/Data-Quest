The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it. r=1-sinθ   Apr  2nd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It. r=1-sinθ (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 3.8              What is this?   Yukimura and Himuro are both graduate students working in the same lab and a prospective couple. However, despite feelings that seem obvious to their lab mates, the pair insist on scientifically quantifying ""love"" in order to empirically prove their attraction to one another. Their quest expands beyond their own lab and into their college's natural science department.    Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it is based on Alifred Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Fridays.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While this may be a season premiere, it sure doesn't feel like it—though that's not to say our characters haven't changed since we last saw them. The first season ended on an exceedingly high note with our main couple achieving the scientificly perfect romantic kiss. While the data for said kiss may be lost, the emotional effect on Yukimura and Himuro is all too evident. The two are more driven than ever to not only prove their “love formula,” but assert their love for each other through it.    The thing is, the perfect kiss has given the two a bit of an ego—after all, it was the single most romantic moment of their (romantically inexperienced) lives. Up until this point, Yukimura and Himuro have studied the love lives of those they had access to—e.g., Kotsuke's love for his 2D girlfriend and Kanade's unrequited love for her teacher, but the only truly reciprocal relationship they've been able to use as a reference point is their own—which neither are sure is “love” in the first place.    Enter Chris and Suiu. Our newest eccentric pair of scientists are a couple made up of a submissive yet passionate man and an extremely sensual and provocative woman. Not only have they been in a long-term relationship of four years, they are as into each other as Gomez and Morticia Addams. Threatened by a couple so obviously in love, what should be nothing more than a gathering of samples turns into a contest between the couples to determine which is more in love based on oxytocin levels.    While this makes for some of the worst science the two have been involved in, it shows just how desperate Yukimura and Himuro are—and how inexperienced. They completely forget that their goal is to simply prove that they are in love, instead of being the most in love couple in the world. While data from Chris and Suiu is important, it is not the baseline for romantic relationships. They would need to do a similar experiment with much tighter controlled variables and a sample size of hundreds to establish that. However, this doesn't stop Yukimura and Himuro from giving into the irrational fear that  Chris and Suiu might be the baseline. And should they fail to match up to the lovey-dovey pair, then they would be forced to choose between their feelings and the scientific truth to which they have devoted their lives. The whole situation is both good character-building and solid setup for comedic moments. And hopefully, after cooling down a bit, they'll be able to realize this and continue on with their scientific exploration of love.       Lynzee Loveridge  Rating:                It's been about two years since we last saw Ayame Himuro and Shinya Yukimura attempt to quantify their feelings for one another and honestly, I feel a little bad that this show has to compete with a somewhat similarly-themed (but immensely more popular) Kaguya-sama. Like that show, we have a primary couple that has caught the doki-dokis for each other but will not outright admit it. Himuro and Yukimura are dead set on gathering evidence to support their feelings, leading to smooching under the pretense of science.    The show has about one joke in its roster and the animation, both in terms of movement and color design, is a little lackluster. Science Fell in Love instead rides purely on charm and for the most part, I'd say it's successful. Himuro and Yukimura's awkwardness isn't overplayed; it could have easily devolved into ""oh god get on with it already"" but neither party is in denial and despite not putting a label on it, both are also enthusiastic about the relationship's romantic progression. They want to kiss and cuddle and thankfully the story finds ways to let them even if its under the guise of a scientific pretense.    The introduction of Chris and Suiu also helps shake things up. The saliva-obsessed ""courtesan"" and her lovestruck English boyfriend make for a fun counter to the less confident couple. I mean, I could do without the glittering, highly-detailed spit but since this episode centers entirely around the fluid and how to measure different hormones in it, I can let it go. Also glad to see the ""edutainment"" aspect return in order to teach us all how elaborate scientific equipment is used (and how your dryer is just another version of a centrifuge).    Science Fell in Love is a cute show. It's not going to do anything amazing, but there are worse ways to spend your time than with a group of dorks fumbling through their romance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

REVIEW: Aharen-san wa Hakarenai             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        Tanteikingdomkey    Joined: 03 Sep 2008 		    Posts: 2294       Posted: Sat Apr 16, 2022 11:45 pm            Sooo just figured I'd ask, since based on the first episode it seemed very obvious.    Is Aharen San supposed to be viewed as being on the autism spectrum? Because a lot of her behavior reminds me a lot of people who are on the spectrum      Back to top                   MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Sun Apr 17, 2022 11:36 am            This show is really sold on the comedic interplay between Raido and Aharen, with Raid's wholesome personality, ditziness, and flights of fancy, and Aharen being so stoic, exaggerated, and yet oddly sweet. Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2 ‒ Episodes 1-3   Apr 19, 01:30 3 comments                 anime    The new introductions have actually done quite a lot to address some of Nijigasaki's biggest weaknesses. Lanzhu of course made a hell of an entrance in the season opener, and I'm eager to learn more about what her deal is.                    ep. review          28 comments       Spy×Family ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 19, 00:30 28 comments                 anime    Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions?

I think all of us need to know that.                    ep. review          81 comments       Akebi's Sailor Uniform ‒ Episodes 10-11   Mar 26, 01:30 81 comments                 anime    There's this lovely everyday tension in episode 11 that really makes it a solid penultimate episode. It's subtle, almost mundane, yet is the cream of slice of life this season because of the emotionality of Komichi's world.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 00:30 47 comments                 anime    Eri reveals her big plot and what set her on the path of villainy this week.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ SERIES FINALE   Mar 25, 23:30 107 comments                 anime    Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 03:30 18 comments                 anime    Slow Loop brings us a Koi-centric episode that's all about reminiscing while in the moment.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 02:30 19 comments                 anime    Our lord and savior Lord Ojiro is ready to make an appearance after definitely doing a murder, but first, it Minato Tribe must be deemed worthy enough to face off against our bemasked liege.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 01:30 48 comments                 anime    Now that Vizzd and Maid-chan have dropped the act and revealed their evil intentions, I'm glad to report they're just as funny – and stupid – as our heroes.                    ep. review          16 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 10   Mar 25, 00:30 16 comments                 anime    At this point you don't need me to keep coming in and telling you that Tokyo 24th Ward's sociopolitical analyses are as fundamentally broken as the corpse-powered computer at the center of its narrative.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    The season's climactic battle against the reanimated and Kurokawa-possessed Tetsujin continues into its second week, with both predictable and surprising developments.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 00:30 89 comments                 anime    Now that we're in the middle of the final arc of the season, we get introduced to another flaw of our titular genius prince: his lack of experience.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 23, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom addresses a refugee crisis and childbirth in one episode with mixed results.                    ep. review          77 comments       Princess Connect!

It's subtle, almost mundane, yet is the cream of slice of life this season because of the emotionality of Komichi's world.                    ep. review          47 comments       Arifureta - From Commonplace to World's Strongest Season 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 26, 00:30 47 comments                 anime    Eri reveals her big plot and what set her on the path of villainy this week.                    ep. review          107 comments       Platinum End ‒ SERIES FINALE   Mar 25, 23:30 107 comments                 anime    Y'know, in hindsight, maybe electing a suicidal 12-year-old to become God was a bad idea.                    ep. review          18 comments       Slow Loop ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 03:30 18 comments                 anime    Slow Loop brings us a Koi-centric episode that's all about reminiscing while in the moment.                    ep. review          19 comments       Tribe Nine ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 02:30 19 comments                 anime    Our lord and savior Lord Ojiro is ready to make an appearance after definitely doing a murder, but first, it Minato Tribe must be deemed worthy enough to face off against our bemasked liege.                    ep. review          48 comments       Life with an Ordinary Guy Who Reincarnated into a Total Fantasy Knockout ‒ Episode 11   Mar 25, 01:30 48 comments                 anime    Now that Vizzd and Maid-chan have dropped the act and revealed their evil intentions, I'm glad to report they're just as funny – and stupid – as our heroes.                    ep. review          16 comments       Tokyo 24th Ward ‒ Episode 10   Mar 25, 00:30 16 comments                 anime    At this point you don't need me to keep coming in and telling you that Tokyo 24th Ward's sociopolitical analyses are as fundamentally broken as the corpse-powered computer at the center of its narrative.                    ep. review          51 comments       Sabikui Bisco ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 01:30 51 comments                 anime    The season's climactic battle against the reanimated and Kurokawa-possessed Tetsujin continues into its second week, with both predictable and surprising developments.                    ep. review          89 comments       The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt ‒ Episode 11   Mar 24, 00:30 89 comments                 anime    Now that we're in the middle of the final arc of the season, we get introduced to another flaw of our titular genius prince: his lack of experience.                    ep. review          145 comments       How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Part 2 ‒ Episode 11   Mar 23, 01:30 145 comments                 anime    How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom addresses a refugee crisis and childbirth in one episode with mixed results.                    ep. review          77 comments       Princess Connect!

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.           That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

I would be very surprised if they did but after following these things for years I've learned to not expect anything until it actually happens and then you won't be disappointed when nothing happens.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.
