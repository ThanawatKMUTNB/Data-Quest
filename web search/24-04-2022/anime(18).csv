The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.3            After two episodes that mostly amounted to exposition about a new random threat that we barely got the chance to see or understand, this week's episode should have been rewarding; all the setup is out of the way, and now it's time to tackle the threat of this giant turtle head-on. But I gotta be honest: I feel very disconnected from a lot of the turmoil that was going on in this episode. It's an inevitable consequence of being told constantly about how destructive the turtle is but never getting to actually see any of that destruction happen or get a better visual sense of how prominent the threat was. It seems like the showrunners have been saving all that carnage for the battle in this episode, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode only makes a lot of the devastation come across as very passive, and as a result, none of the deaths on screen feel like they carry any significant weight. When one of the prominent political figures goes out in a blaze of glory or when hundreds of soldiers die on the battlefield, it just makes them feel like fodder, even if that was never the intention.    That said, this episode does have its moments, accompanied by some nice animation cuts here and there. The way the turtle's head is cut off is appreciably creative. I also liked the beginning of this episode where Naofumi was actually seen as someone to be revered with a lot of respect and authority. Again, it's nice seeing the difference between how he is treated now versus how he was treated before. It even got to the point where his very presence seemed to boost morale amongst soldiers and despite the casualties, his plans did seem to work. Obviously things aren't that simple and I immediately called that there was a catch when the turtle was “killed”. We still don't know who's been controlling this turtle behind the scenes, and the turtle's presence still feels foreboding even without its head. Let's hope the conflict gets more engaging and streamlined next week.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.3            After two episodes that mostly amounted to exposition about a new random threat that we barely got the chance to see or understand, this week's episode should have been rewarding; all the setup is out of the way, and now it's time to tackle the threat of this giant turtle head-on. But I gotta be honest: I feel very disconnected from a lot of the turmoil that was going on in this episode. It's an inevitable consequence of being told constantly about how destructive the turtle is but never getting to actually see any of that destruction happen or get a better visual sense of how prominent the threat was. It seems like the showrunners have been saving all that carnage for the battle in this episode, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode only makes a lot of the devastation come across as very passive, and as a result, none of the deaths on screen feel like they carry any significant weight. When one of the prominent political figures goes out in a blaze of glory or when hundreds of soldiers die on the battlefield, it just makes them feel like fodder, even if that was never the intention.    That said, this episode does have its moments, accompanied by some nice animation cuts here and there. The way the turtle's head is cut off is appreciably creative. I also liked the beginning of this episode where Naofumi was actually seen as someone to be revered with a lot of respect and authority. Again, it's nice seeing the difference between how he is treated now versus how he was treated before. It even got to the point where his very presence seemed to boost morale amongst soldiers and despite the casualties, his plans did seem to work. Obviously things aren't that simple and I immediately called that there was a catch when the turtle was “killed”. We still don't know who's been controlling this turtle behind the scenes, and the turtle's presence still feels foreboding even without its head. Let's hope the conflict gets more engaging and streamlined next week.

That said, this episode does have its moments, accompanied by some nice animation cuts here and there. The way the turtle's head is cut off is appreciably creative. I also liked the beginning of this episode where Naofumi was actually seen as someone to be revered with a lot of respect and authority. Again, it's nice seeing the difference between how he is treated now versus how he was treated before. It even got to the point where his very presence seemed to boost morale amongst soldiers and despite the casualties, his plans did seem to work. Obviously things aren't that simple and I immediately called that there was a catch when the turtle was “killed”. We still don't know who's been controlling this turtle behind the scenes, and the turtle's presence still feels foreboding even without its head. Let's hope the conflict gets more engaging and streamlined next week.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Interview: How the Staff of She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man Made An Old Man Cute   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 13th 2022          Among the genre of VRMMORPG novels, She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man presents an interesting world shaped by the players in its past. The main character, Danblf, transforms into a young girl and journeys through a changed world set 30 years later. ANN spoke to the novel author Hirotsugu Ryusen, as well as director Keitaro Motonaga and screenwriter Takamitsu Kouno about how they brought the virtual world to life.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For author Hirotsugu Ryusen) The protagonist enters the game world only to realize that many years have passed within the game. What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time. By referring to the knowledge and experiences I accumulated from that MMO, I was able to work out my ideal world for a game. I've also enjoyed creating worlds for a long time. I note down the details of a fictional game when I think of them, and when I combined them on this opportunity, this is what I got.     Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

Are you the kind of writer who begins thinking about the world or the characters first?   RYUSEN: If I had to say, I suppose I start with the world… My ideal world. The people who live there. And the characters who stand out among them. I suppose that's how it goes.     What is the appeal of young girls who refer to themselves as ""washi""?   RYUSEN: I wonder, indeed… When I think about it, I never actually considered what was the appeal. I was just drawn to it hazily. I don't quite get it, but I like it. That can happen, right?    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   (For director Keitaro Motonaga)  Regarding the depiction of the VRMMORPG world, did you use any existing MMORPGs or other games as references?   MOTONAGA: I tried out a few titles my friend recommended to me and used them as references. For the things I referenced inside the game, I made sure not to make the resemblance too strong.     What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.

What inspired this part of the story's premise?   RYUSEN: I like pure fantasy, but I also like it when modern technology has been arranged in a fantasy-like way. As I was thinking about how to create a setting where it wouldn't be strange for those elements to exist, I took inspiration from other novels I was reading at the time. I thought it would be neat to create a time skip and make the former players, who already possess modern knowledge, accomplish various feats ahead of time.    Also, because of the influence of those players, special modern words have spread throughout society in those 30 years. It gave me some looseness to play with words to an extent.     The novel explains the VRMMORPG setting in a lot of detail. What was your approach to creating the world?   RYUSEN: The foundation was built on the MMORPG I was engrossed in at the time.

What sort of things did you keep in mind in order to depict Mira's cuteness?   MOTONAGA: I didn't want her to just be cute. Since she used to be Danblf, I kept Danblf's movements in mind, like how she carries herself when she stands. For example, she puts her hands on her hips or crosses her arms. Through those Danblf-like mannerisms, I tried to show Mira's cuteness.     How did you decide on the worldview of the anime? What kind of directions did you give to the art director?   MOTONAGA: That's a secret! (laughs) Anyway, I wanted the world to look beautiful, with a crisp and clean air. I asked him to be conscious of beautiful European streets and the World Heritage sites, and to capture the vibes around those places. That's all I asked for.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project    What inspired the montage at the end of episode 1?   MOTONAGA: I wanted to make Mira's signature line “I am cute” (said with an old man's first-person pronoun “washi”) stand out. I wondered if there was a way I could express it, and the montage was what I came up with.    That wasn't the only thing, of course. Like I mentioned before, I asked the art director to convey the vibes of beautiful European streets. By not having any spoken lines, we could show off the world and its atmosphere.    (For series composition writer Takamitsu Kouno) What was your first impression of the original work?   KOUNO: I thought it was wonderful. What makes it outstandingly original is that it's a game world where the existing skills, magic, towns, and kingdoms have all been shaped by the hands of players. I also think it's great how the story is based around the actions of the protagonist Danblf/Mira.     What did you keep in mind this time when writing the script?   KOUNO: The protagonist Mira is a beautiful and lovely girl. However, she was originally the dignified wise sage Danblf. And behind that is a player acting out a role. What was the best way to depict this amusing, peculiar, complicated, and mysterious figure? That was the first thing I turned my attention to. Specifically, I took care not to make Mira exhibit “girlish” mannerisms, words, or actions.    When the player is presenting himself as the wise sage Danblf, he is taking care to roleplay in a dignified manner. That doesn't change even when he turns into Mira. That's why the biggest thing I kept in mind when writing the script was how to act out Mira.    ©2021 Hirotsugu Ryusen,Fuzichoco/MICRO MAGAZINE/I'm cute Project   How did you balance the amount of information in the novel with the action? The series also has a lot of characters, so what did you keep in mind to make each of them stand out in the anime?   KOUNO: The amount of material you can cover in 12 anime episodes that are 20 minutes long is limited, no matter how you slice it. Because of this, we consulted with the original creator's side at the script meetings in order to decide on the most absolutely essential information and scenes to prioritize. In order to ensure that the numerous guest characters have impact in the anime, we took care to depict not just their dialogue but also to give them action that leaves an impression.     Which characters did you particularly enjoy writing the lines for?   KOUNO: I especially enjoyed writing Mira and Solomon's interactions. Before Mira became known as one of the nine sages or Solomon established the kingdom of Arkite, they were both friendly in the real world. That makes their conversations very amusing. Even though they're in the dreadful situation of being stuck in a game world, I think the fact that Mira, Solomon, and the others can smile through it all is rooted in how they've stuck together through thick and thin. Through their conversations, I depicted them as not just game friends, but as real-life friends.    She Professed Herself Pupil of the Wise Man is streaming on Funimation.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

It generally makes sense, but just feels kind of wordy at times. Maybe it's an Aniplex thing?   I started playing the game a few weeks ago and the dialogue there seems more polished and easier to follow than the anime series.

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize. I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

It generally makes sense, but just feels kind of wordy at times. Maybe it's an Aniplex thing?   I started playing the game a few weeks ago and the dialogue there seems more polished and easier to follow than the anime series.

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize. I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious.

I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.            Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.

When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.  No mysteries or revalations make any impact if you don't have a solid footing.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done.

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize. I also didn't like how she didn't fully commit to it (saying 'servant' instead of 'friend' because I guess that's what an asshole who's also shy does?), but Kaede and Rena seem to fully intend to get better at their dynamic, if with baby steps.

Also, as I seemingly must constantly remind people for this franchise, they are, at most, fourteen. And they were recruited by a scheming alien specifically for their immaturity and emotional instability. I don't know why people keep expecting these kids to be wiser and more rational than the average adult.   I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done.

Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.

When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.

When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.

(I promise I'll be nice and wont spoil anything. But I will say that the timeline of the game story & how it relates to the main one is almost immediately clear in the tutorial phase if anyone is really that curious)   The world of PMMM and how anyone can be a magical girl was really my favorite aspect of it so that's what makes me love the game so much. It's like a secret society of magical girls and I think that's neat.   As an adaptation of that story I think it's really been a big improvement to me. There's also been little details that are different from the game that I know Inu Curry's taken in consideration on purpose - so really there's a mystery in how everything will unfold for me too, it could go in a completely different direction than what I'm thinking! And I think that uncertainty is still a big strength that remains from the original PMMM too.   But anyway, I'm looking forward to the rest of these reviews!

So, it's pure speculation.   The ui thing strikes me as not as simple, because either iroha had a pretyt weird wish where ui does not really exist or someone else (including ui) wished ui out nof existence; in episode 3 it also bothered me that iroha hasui's memories. (and thanks to k-on I feel very tempted to call iroha ""yui"").

As for the show... it's decent. It thread well the line between being its own things while alos being obviously related. I gotta say none of the character are particularly interesting as of right now but they're not annoying either.

I wasn't sure I'd watch it, given that Madoka is one of my favorite anime, not to mention that it's a mobile game adaption which typically don't have very good stories, but I'm glad I did. I have a guess as to what happened to Ui based solely on a scene from the opening sequence. In the opening sequence, we see two pink-haired girls wearing different outfits, combine in a flash of light and turn into a magical girl. This leads me to guess that for some reason the wish that Iroha made, rather than curing Ui's illness, actually combined the both of them into one entity, hence why at the beginning of the series Iroha had forgotten her. I could be wrong, but if I'm not that's one huge spoiler in the opening sequence.

Yeah, I didn't like the resolution in episode 3, and so far I find the show to be pretty boring. I agree that they totally nailed the Witch Labyrinth aesthetic, and the city backgrounds are gorgeous, but everything else is kinda lacking. The direction in particular leaves a lot to be desired: never mind the CGI, the decision to start off episode 3 with a flashback to Ui's time at the hospital was really disorienting considering how episode 2 ended.   I'm gonna keep watching 'cause I wanna see what Yachiyo has to bring to the table (and 'cause I'm a slave to this franchise), but I hope the show gets better now that the first arc is done. Also, less sitting around talking, please.

It generally makes sense, but just feels kind of wordy at times. Maybe it's an Aniplex thing?

Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

I'm sort of confused by how the review acknowledges that since this is a Madoka show, it's bound to have unexpected twists and turns, but also doesn't see any reason to think that Ui will be one of them. Maybe I'm misremembering, but didn't the anime already show her spoiler[appearing to magical girls in a Christmas Carol ghost sort of way, to invite them to Kamihama?] That, on top of how only Iroha remembers her, certainly seems suspicious. There's a scene in the game where she spoiler[infiltrates Homura's time-stop field], which will probably come up in the anime eventually. I don't think the English version of the game has explained Ui yet, but she's clearly got some Stuff going on. spoiler[Most likely she's one of the Magius, if not their overlord.]      Back to top                  Everlasting Coconut    Joined: 22 Jul 2019 		    Posts: 150       Posted: Mon Jan 20, 2020 9:58 pm              killjoy_the wrote:      Kaede waited for Rena to (finally) apologize.

Yeah, the ""servant"" thing ticked me off too.   And I'm sure they'll get better cause that's what the ending of the episode was trying to imply (I guess?), it just failed to make me like these characters or want to follow their journey.

It's not like we're gonna have fully fledged characters, everyone in the series is completely shallow, since they expect you to play the game for getting to know about the characters.  The adaptation is dry, as it's only meant to please the players, and provoke some interest among those who don't, so they'll try the game too.   But really, it isn't working, if nothing else then solely because aside from being pretty, this series has nothing to offer to someone not familiar with the games.

The problem with the review is not only to avoid the game to avoid spoilers, but to ignore that lore. The opening scene of episode 3, for example, is very significant for those who saw the original series (perpetual motion! entropy!), but the review only mentions it in a footnote and for the aesthetic aspect.

It is not to be expected fully fledged characters from the beginning, but misteries, surprising revelations and plot twists. In the original series, it was only possible to understand who  Homura really was in the tenth episode and Madoka in the last.spoiler[ For those who do not know the game, Ui and the two friends who appear at the beginning of the third episode will be even greater surprises.]      Back to top                  BSW    Joined: 22 Jun 2012 		    Posts: 116       Posted: Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:41 am            I think knowing PMMM lore isn't enough to enjoy what we're seeing, it might be enough to understand it, but the characters will still be ultimately unlikable and shallow, because as I stated above, it relies on you knowing them, and their circumstances, the anime never shows us anything of those. When it's so obvious they're checking boxes of what they need to adapt instead of focusing on making the anime enjoyable in itself too, it becomes dry like this, or you could call it ""soulless"".  Thing is, Magia Record is a pretty bad series because of this, and almost a sacrilage on the franchise.   There's a difference in being slice of life, and giving us a minimal amount of information to care about characters and the world they're living in - PMMM did the latter, whereas Magi Reco fails at it.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day.

In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop.

The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that.

Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.

24-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/thermae-romae-novae/.183660,Thermae Romae Novae - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week.

It feels like forever since we first saw the game revealed. Surprise, surprise – it's suffering from COVID-related development setbacks. ― Here we are, on the final day of 2021.

Just a heads-up: This Week in Games is probably going to be a Friday thing from now on.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 6  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 6 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.3            It's back! Delicious Party♡Precure has returned to remind everyone that you need to be careful on social media, because you never know if the bad guys are going to follow your Instagram feed to pick their targets. It's actually kind of a clever way to more fully introduce the girl who will become Cure Yum-Yum next week – we've seen her in most episodes, she sits between Yui and Kokone in class, but apart from that, there's not really been any good reason for her to join the team. Not that that's a necessity, but it does feel like just another way this iteration of the franchise is doing a particularly good job: she has to be Cure Yum-Yum because she's inadvertently been involved in what's going on from the beginning.    That little revelation aside, this is another very solid episode that continues the work of developing Kokone. Yui's a great character and I love that she attacks Ubau-zo with whatever she's got to hand since she can't transform until Mari shows up with Kome-Kome, but Kokone has a lot more going on internally. Yui is the first real friend she's ever had, and it's clear that she's having a hard time adjusting to what that means. While she's not overtly over-enthusiastic, we still see the markers of her joy and worry. The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place. Certainly the girls' inner strength attracted Kome-Kome and Pam-Pam, and I'd argue that it even helped Mari to come out of his slump. In Kokone's case, it's an ongoing give-and-take – her transformation is possible because of the reserves of strength she has, and that strength can come out because she's shown her own possibilities via transformation.    All of this builds on the previous episodes, but also the tongue-in-cheek use of the old-school rumor trope. The girls' school may not have seven school mysteries (yet), but watching the rumor about the monster in the home ec room (which uses the myth of the tsukumogami as its root, a great touch, especially since one girl heard it from her grandmother) spread completely out of control is one of the most realistic middle school moments I've seen recently. That's exactly how those things happen, and a shout-out to that one kid who counters “It has 7,000 teeth!” with “Isn't that too many?”    How Cure Yum-Yum fits into Kokone's growth, the overall battle, and a potential plotline about social media is going to start to come clear next week. Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place. Certainly the girls' inner strength attracted Kome-Kome and Pam-Pam, and I'd argue that it even helped Mari to come out of his slump. In Kokone's case, it's an ongoing give-and-take – her transformation is possible because of the reserves of strength she has, and that strength can come out because she's shown her own possibilities via transformation.    All of this builds on the previous episodes, but also the tongue-in-cheek use of the old-school rumor trope. The girls' school may not have seven school mysteries (yet), but watching the rumor about the monster in the home ec room (which uses the myth of the tsukumogami as its root, a great touch, especially since one girl heard it from her grandmother) spread completely out of control is one of the most realistic middle school moments I've seen recently. That's exactly how those things happen, and a shout-out to that one kid who counters “It has 7,000 teeth!” with “Isn't that too many?”    How Cure Yum-Yum fits into Kokone's growth, the overall battle, and a potential plotline about social media is going to start to come clear next week. Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 6  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 6 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.3            It's back! Delicious Party♡Precure has returned to remind everyone that you need to be careful on social media, because you never know if the bad guys are going to follow your Instagram feed to pick their targets. It's actually kind of a clever way to more fully introduce the girl who will become Cure Yum-Yum next week – we've seen her in most episodes, she sits between Yui and Kokone in class, but apart from that, there's not really been any good reason for her to join the team. Not that that's a necessity, but it does feel like just another way this iteration of the franchise is doing a particularly good job: she has to be Cure Yum-Yum because she's inadvertently been involved in what's going on from the beginning.    That little revelation aside, this is another very solid episode that continues the work of developing Kokone. Yui's a great character and I love that she attacks Ubau-zo with whatever she's got to hand since she can't transform until Mari shows up with Kome-Kome, but Kokone has a lot more going on internally. Yui is the first real friend she's ever had, and it's clear that she's having a hard time adjusting to what that means. While she's not overtly over-enthusiastic, we still see the markers of her joy and worry. The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place.

Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

Delicious Party Precure Episode 6  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 6 of Delicious Party♡Precure ?                     Community score: 4.3            It's back! Delicious Party♡Precure has returned to remind everyone that you need to be careful on social media, because you never know if the bad guys are going to follow your Instagram feed to pick their targets. It's actually kind of a clever way to more fully introduce the girl who will become Cure Yum-Yum next week – we've seen her in most episodes, she sits between Yui and Kokone in class, but apart from that, there's not really been any good reason for her to join the team. Not that that's a necessity, but it does feel like just another way this iteration of the franchise is doing a particularly good job: she has to be Cure Yum-Yum because she's inadvertently been involved in what's going on from the beginning.    That little revelation aside, this is another very solid episode that continues the work of developing Kokone. Yui's a great character and I love that she attacks Ubau-zo with whatever she's got to hand since she can't transform until Mari shows up with Kome-Kome, but Kokone has a lot more going on internally. Yui is the first real friend she's ever had, and it's clear that she's having a hard time adjusting to what that means. While she's not overtly over-enthusiastic, we still see the markers of her joy and worry. The basket of unending sandwiches is a very good indicator of her emotions: it's obviously overkill, but it's just as clearly the only way she can really think of to show Yui that she appreciates and admires her – by using the skill Yui taught her to make her a gift. And if we consider that Kokone's lived in what looks an awful lot like excess (at least for one kid), she doesn't know any other way to do things. The little bento of prosciutto-wrapped melon is her attempting to do something even more special and to share some of what she knows with Yui. I'm not 100% sure that she doesn't have a bit of a crush on Yui as well, but if she does, who could blame her – the way that Yui treats her as a person while everyone else at school acts as if she's royalty made of blown-glass is in some ways even more important than their shared job of protecting the town.    Though their duty as Pretty Cures does help with Kokone's friend-making skills too. While Yui is attacking the salad spinner monster with a soccer ball, Kokone's equally busy, and it's through her actions that she shows the other girls that she's not that different from them. Being a magical girl has given Kokone the courage to step up, and that's really what I love about the genre – it's empowering in the way that it shows that while having magical powers can help, it's really about the power inside yourself that's the most important. Magical girls need to care before they transform, and in some ways that's what enables the transformation in the first place. Certainly the girls' inner strength attracted Kome-Kome and Pam-Pam, and I'd argue that it even helped Mari to come out of his slump. In Kokone's case, it's an ongoing give-and-take – her transformation is possible because of the reserves of strength she has, and that strength can come out because she's shown her own possibilities via transformation.    All of this builds on the previous episodes, but also the tongue-in-cheek use of the old-school rumor trope. The girls' school may not have seven school mysteries (yet), but watching the rumor about the monster in the home ec room (which uses the myth of the tsukumogami as its root, a great touch, especially since one girl heard it from her grandmother) spread completely out of control is one of the most realistic middle school moments I've seen recently. That's exactly how those things happen, and a shout-out to that one kid who counters “It has 7,000 teeth!” with “Isn't that too many?”    How Cure Yum-Yum fits into Kokone's growth, the overall battle, and a potential plotline about social media is going to start to come clear next week. Whether or not she also thinks that 7,000 teeth on a kettle monster is too many remains to be seen, but either way, I'm excited to see what she brings to the story.

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

GN 1                     Synopsis:             Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?      Review:         Synopsis:        Oogami has just been transferred to the planning department of the bedding company he works for. Since he was never all that keen on sales where he was before, this doesn't really bother him, even if he's the only carnivore working there. But he's also got a raging crush on Mitsuji, his new boss – and since she's an herbivore, that means that he has to really work at controlling himself. Is his love doomed before it even gets started?     Review:            It's not entirely fair to say that this is essentially BEASTARS Lite, but it's also a little hard to shake that feeling. Shino Shimizu's I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! takes a just-similar-enough premise to tell its workplace romantic comedy: in its world, people have animal characteristics and are divided between herbivore and carnivore. They're not full-on animals, but rather people somehow descended or evolved from animals, with everyone having ears, tails (if applicable), and general tendencies inherited from their ancestors. There's a definite sense that the whole carnivore/herbivore classification isn't just about ancestry, however; it's also part of Japanese slang for how aggressive (or perhaps just interested) someone is in romantic or sexual encounters. Therefore Oogami, our hero, is going to have more trouble holding himself back from pursuing Mitsuji, our heroine, because he is a wolf and she's a sheep.    Part of this feeling stems from the fact that Shimizu's deliberately blurring the lines when it comes to carnivores talking about things like “biting” herbivores. Based on the context, it could be either a literal bite or a form of sexual behavior, and that mostly comes from some of Oogami's new coworkers and his job change. Before the story starts, Oogami was a salesman in the same company, and pretty much the entire sales team is composed of carnivores – a black leopard, a lion, a cat, another wolf, et cetera. Oogami remarks that he was basically herded into sales because of his wolf heritage, with the implication that that really wasn't where his interest lay at all. Meanwhile the product development team is, prior to Oogami's arrival, entirely made up of herbivores, and mostly sheep at that. Alice, one of the women in the department, notes that other carnivores have been brought into the department only to be run right out when they couldn't control themselves around all of the sheep – something that Alice and two of her friends are very interested in replicating so that they can get rid of Oogami. They make attempts to railroad him into “biting” them, but none of them work because he's so invested in Mitsuji, which, somewhat ironically, is a large part of why Alice and the others want him gone. As sheep, they're very protective of their leader, Mitsuji, and that makes Oogami a threat to her safety in their eyes.    Part of the light humor of the book comes from the fact that despite their protestations of “I'm like this because I'm a wolf/sheep/cat/whatever,” most of the characters are acting against type. Oogami might want Mitsuji desperately, but he's also able to behave like a decent person around her because he doesn't want to ruin his chance with her. Mitsuji may find herself shaking in meetings with carnivores or inclined to take up as little space as possible, but she's also incredibly capable and actually pretty comfortable around just about everyone, regardless of species. Alice is certainly no wilting wallflower and is more proactive than Hyoukawa the black leopard when it comes to getting what she wants. The animal natures feel more like societal assumptions than anything more primordial, stand-ins for gender and social class markers dressed up with ears and tails in order to lightly poke at them.    And it is a light form of social parody, so much so that you could easily ignore that entire aspect in favor of simply focusing on the romantic comedy elements. Things like the way Oogami's tail wags enthusiastically without his awareness when he's talking to Mitsuji or Alice tracking down Mitsuji's whereabouts from a piece of tail fluff work with the animal factors nicely while still keeping things lighthearted and a little goofy, and plenty of the staples of office romance are in place, such as getting locked in the reference room (workplace manga's equivalent of the gym storage room), going out drinking with colleagues, and interdepartmental competition. Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.             Grade:      Overall : B Story : B Art : B-  + Cute story and budding relationship, good use of tails to show emotions. − Art can be inconsistent, a bit thin on plot.            discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Shino Shimizu   Full encyclopedia details aboutI'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep!

Oogami's crush on Mitsuji is more or less an open secret (even Mitsuji has at least an idea that he likes her) and serves to not only drive the plot, but to allow the characters to air all of their ingrained assumptions about themselves and others in the same way that someone's work record determines their worth in non-animal-based office rom coms. The animal bits and pieces pop up in odd moments to remind us they're there, such as Mitsuji's latest project being a pillow for people with horns.    Interestingly enough, there really isn't much made of the fact that some of the sheep have horns and others don't, which, if you're as inclined to overthinking as I am, could have easily been used as a marker of breed; instead, it is treated here like curly versus straight hair – some people have one and some people have the other. Of course, there isn't a ton of artistic consistency across the book as horned sheep are sometimes drawn without their horns, so it may be less intentional than it at first appears. It's very nice to look at otherwise, and I definitely appreciate that Shimizu explains why characters have both animal ears and human ears; basically the animal ears are nonfunctional in terms of hearing, but are an evolutionary leftover that can serve as emotional expressions.    All in all, I'm a Wolf, but My Boss is a Sheep! is a fun little story. It isn't reinventing the office rom com wheel, but it also doesn't need to – it's just a variation on the theme with cute animal elements, which includes a bit of wordplay with the characters' names and their respective animal ancestors. Largely devoid of mean humor and mostly fluffy, it's a nice light read when you just want a book to relax with.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episode 4  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.5            Something that's been bouncing around in my brain since this show started is what, if anything, the people around Raido and Aharen think of their strange little friendship. After all, these kids are getting up to weird shit in the middle of class on a near-daily basis, so it stands to reason somebody would take notice of the two quiet kids in the back building pillow forts out of their desks, right? I assumed that was just something the show was glossing over for the sake of getting more gags in, the better to not get bogged down in explaining the inherent humor of its jokes, but it would seem Aharen-san was just holding its cards close to its chest before it revealed Tobaru-sensei.    Teacher characters in these shows typically work as the disciplinarian. You know, the ones who catch the over-reacting character right after the punchline and reprimand them for being distracted at school. (For example, the teacher was basically the third most prominent character at the start of Teasing Master Takagi-san.) But since our central couple are too quiet to actually disturb the class, Tobaru instead winds up as an audience surrogate, reacting to their antics from afar but unable to call them out because they're technically not causing any disturbance. Of course she's also a named character in this show, with a wacky quirk of her own as a classical literature nerd, so she somehow sees echoes of ancient, cordial courtships in these two kids' slapstick routine. It's honestly pretty cute, and reminds me of teachers I'm friends with who like to tell stories about their students' obvious crushes on each other.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episode 4  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.5            Something that's been bouncing around in my brain since this show started is what, if anything, the people around Raido and Aharen think of their strange little friendship. After all, these kids are getting up to weird shit in the middle of class on a near-daily basis, so it stands to reason somebody would take notice of the two quiet kids in the back building pillow forts out of their desks, right? I assumed that was just something the show was glossing over for the sake of getting more gags in, the better to not get bogged down in explaining the inherent humor of its jokes, but it would seem Aharen-san was just holding its cards close to its chest before it revealed Tobaru-sensei.    Teacher characters in these shows typically work as the disciplinarian. You know, the ones who catch the over-reacting character right after the punchline and reprimand them for being distracted at school. (For example, the teacher was basically the third most prominent character at the start of Teasing Master Takagi-san.) But since our central couple are too quiet to actually disturb the class, Tobaru instead winds up as an audience surrogate, reacting to their antics from afar but unable to call them out because they're technically not causing any disturbance. Of course she's also a named character in this show, with a wacky quirk of her own as a classical literature nerd, so she somehow sees echoes of ancient, cordial courtships in these two kids' slapstick routine. It's honestly pretty cute, and reminds me of teachers I'm friends with who like to tell stories about their students' obvious crushes on each other.    Though that gag in and of itself isn't all that strong, so thankfully the show moves on from her introduction pretty swiftly. That's something I appreciate with the show in general, really. With material like this there's risk of dragging out bits past their breaking point to fill time, but Aharen-san continues to move at a breezy pace, so the painfully cringy (on purpose!) segment about Aharen and Raido communicating through freestyle rapping doesn't outstay its welcome. We get in, we get some amazing fashion choices courtesy of Raido's imagination, hear some decently funny bars from our leads, and then we get out before anyone starts having Hypnosis Mic war flashbacks.    Speaking of flashbacks, if you needed any hint that the original manga started running in 2017, look no further than the goddamn Fidget Spinner sequence that comes right after. There's not a more perfect media time capsule than seeing that green hunk of plastic and ball bearings flick back and forth across the screen, and I'm ashamed to admit that just the image of our leads holding the thing had me cracking up. It's like when Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card had Tomoyo using a drone camera – something about the absurdity of seeing these cute little anime characters interacting with something I so heavily associate with overexcited kids in a toy aisle just had me in stitches. I can't really explain it, but they found the dopamine button in my brain and hit it real hard. Again, it lasts just long to enough to get some good jokes in and then moves on, and the episode is better for it.    Things do slow down in the final segment, as the introduction of some little kids characters just feels a little rote. There's still some funny gags, thanks to Raido's bizarre worry about “wild beasts” and losing to a grade schooler at Reversi. But overall seeing these two deal with bratty kids just isn't as interesting compared to when they're getting up to nonsense on their own. We do at least end things with a good gag about Aharen riding her mighty steed (read: big dog) to close it all out, but Aharen-san is at its best when it's delivering deadpan absurdity. Arguing with little kids is something I could get from a bunch of different comedies, and I'd much rather see Tobaro or Oshiro return before these kids.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episode 4  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.5            Something that's been bouncing around in my brain since this show started is what, if anything, the people around Raido and Aharen think of their strange little friendship. After all, these kids are getting up to weird shit in the middle of class on a near-daily basis, so it stands to reason somebody would take notice of the two quiet kids in the back building pillow forts out of their desks, right? I assumed that was just something the show was glossing over for the sake of getting more gags in, the better to not get bogged down in explaining the inherent humor of its jokes, but it would seem Aharen-san was just holding its cards close to its chest before it revealed Tobaru-sensei.    Teacher characters in these shows typically work as the disciplinarian. You know, the ones who catch the over-reacting character right after the punchline and reprimand them for being distracted at school. (For example, the teacher was basically the third most prominent character at the start of Teasing Master Takagi-san.) But since our central couple are too quiet to actually disturb the class, Tobaru instead winds up as an audience surrogate, reacting to their antics from afar but unable to call them out because they're technically not causing any disturbance. Of course she's also a named character in this show, with a wacky quirk of her own as a classical literature nerd, so she somehow sees echoes of ancient, cordial courtships in these two kids' slapstick routine. It's honestly pretty cute, and reminds me of teachers I'm friends with who like to tell stories about their students' obvious crushes on each other.    Though that gag in and of itself isn't all that strong, so thankfully the show moves on from her introduction pretty swiftly. That's something I appreciate with the show in general, really. With material like this there's risk of dragging out bits past their breaking point to fill time, but Aharen-san continues to move at a breezy pace, so the painfully cringy (on purpose!) segment about Aharen and Raido communicating through freestyle rapping doesn't outstay its welcome. We get in, we get some amazing fashion choices courtesy of Raido's imagination, hear some decently funny bars from our leads, and then we get out before anyone starts having Hypnosis Mic war flashbacks.    Speaking of flashbacks, if you needed any hint that the original manga started running in 2017, look no further than the goddamn Fidget Spinner sequence that comes right after. There's not a more perfect media time capsule than seeing that green hunk of plastic and ball bearings flick back and forth across the screen, and I'm ashamed to admit that just the image of our leads holding the thing had me cracking up. It's like when Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card had Tomoyo using a drone camera – something about the absurdity of seeing these cute little anime characters interacting with something I so heavily associate with overexcited kids in a toy aisle just had me in stitches. I can't really explain it, but they found the dopamine button in my brain and hit it real hard. Again, it lasts just long to enough to get some good jokes in and then moves on, and the episode is better for it.    Things do slow down in the final segment, as the introduction of some little kids characters just feels a little rote. There's still some funny gags, thanks to Raido's bizarre worry about “wild beasts” and losing to a grade schooler at Reversi. But overall seeing these two deal with bratty kids just isn't as interesting compared to when they're getting up to nonsense on their own. We do at least end things with a good gag about Aharen riding her mighty steed (read: big dog) to close it all out, but Aharen-san is at its best when it's delivering deadpan absurdity. Arguing with little kids is something I could get from a bunch of different comedies, and I'd much rather see Tobaro or Oshiro return before these kids.

Arguing with little kids is something I could get from a bunch of different comedies, and I'd much rather see Tobaro or Oshiro return before these kids.

Aharen-san wa Hakarenai Episode 4  by Nicholas Dupree, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 4 of Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ?                     Community score: 4.5            Something that's been bouncing around in my brain since this show started is what, if anything, the people around Raido and Aharen think of their strange little friendship. After all, these kids are getting up to weird shit in the middle of class on a near-daily basis, so it stands to reason somebody would take notice of the two quiet kids in the back building pillow forts out of their desks, right? I assumed that was just something the show was glossing over for the sake of getting more gags in, the better to not get bogged down in explaining the inherent humor of its jokes, but it would seem Aharen-san was just holding its cards close to its chest before it revealed Tobaru-sensei.    Teacher characters in these shows typically work as the disciplinarian. You know, the ones who catch the over-reacting character right after the punchline and reprimand them for being distracted at school. (For example, the teacher was basically the third most prominent character at the start of Teasing Master Takagi-san.) But since our central couple are too quiet to actually disturb the class, Tobaru instead winds up as an audience surrogate, reacting to their antics from afar but unable to call them out because they're technically not causing any disturbance. Of course she's also a named character in this show, with a wacky quirk of her own as a classical literature nerd, so she somehow sees echoes of ancient, cordial courtships in these two kids' slapstick routine. It's honestly pretty cute, and reminds me of teachers I'm friends with who like to tell stories about their students' obvious crushes on each other.    Though that gag in and of itself isn't all that strong, so thankfully the show moves on from her introduction pretty swiftly. That's something I appreciate with the show in general, really. With material like this there's risk of dragging out bits past their breaking point to fill time, but Aharen-san continues to move at a breezy pace, so the painfully cringy (on purpose!) segment about Aharen and Raido communicating through freestyle rapping doesn't outstay its welcome. We get in, we get some amazing fashion choices courtesy of Raido's imagination, hear some decently funny bars from our leads, and then we get out before anyone starts having Hypnosis Mic war flashbacks.    Speaking of flashbacks, if you needed any hint that the original manga started running in 2017, look no further than the goddamn Fidget Spinner sequence that comes right after. There's not a more perfect media time capsule than seeing that green hunk of plastic and ball bearings flick back and forth across the screen, and I'm ashamed to admit that just the image of our leads holding the thing had me cracking up. It's like when Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card had Tomoyo using a drone camera – something about the absurdity of seeing these cute little anime characters interacting with something I so heavily associate with overexcited kids in a toy aisle just had me in stitches. I can't really explain it, but they found the dopamine button in my brain and hit it real hard. Again, it lasts just long to enough to get some good jokes in and then moves on, and the episode is better for it.    Things do slow down in the final segment, as the introduction of some little kids characters just feels a little rote. There's still some funny gags, thanks to Raido's bizarre worry about “wild beasts” and losing to a grade schooler at Reversi. But overall seeing these two deal with bratty kids just isn't as interesting compared to when they're getting up to nonsense on their own. We do at least end things with a good gag about Aharen riding her mighty steed (read: big dog) to close it all out, but Aharen-san is at its best when it's delivering deadpan absurdity.

(For example, the teacher was basically the third most prominent character at the start of Teasing Master Takagi-san.) But since our central couple are too quiet to actually disturb the class, Tobaru instead winds up as an audience surrogate, reacting to their antics from afar but unable to call them out because they're technically not causing any disturbance. Of course she's also a named character in this show, with a wacky quirk of her own as a classical literature nerd, so she somehow sees echoes of ancient, cordial courtships in these two kids' slapstick routine. It's honestly pretty cute, and reminds me of teachers I'm friends with who like to tell stories about their students' obvious crushes on each other.    Though that gag in and of itself isn't all that strong, so thankfully the show moves on from her introduction pretty swiftly. That's something I appreciate with the show in general, really. With material like this there's risk of dragging out bits past their breaking point to fill time, but Aharen-san continues to move at a breezy pace, so the painfully cringy (on purpose!) segment about Aharen and Raido communicating through freestyle rapping doesn't outstay its welcome. We get in, we get some amazing fashion choices courtesy of Raido's imagination, hear some decently funny bars from our leads, and then we get out before anyone starts having Hypnosis Mic war flashbacks.    Speaking of flashbacks, if you needed any hint that the original manga started running in 2017, look no further than the goddamn Fidget Spinner sequence that comes right after. There's not a more perfect media time capsule than seeing that green hunk of plastic and ball bearings flick back and forth across the screen, and I'm ashamed to admit that just the image of our leads holding the thing had me cracking up. It's like when Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card had Tomoyo using a drone camera – something about the absurdity of seeing these cute little anime characters interacting with something I so heavily associate with overexcited kids in a toy aisle just had me in stitches. I can't really explain it, but they found the dopamine button in my brain and hit it real hard. Again, it lasts just long to enough to get some good jokes in and then moves on, and the episode is better for it.    Things do slow down in the final segment, as the introduction of some little kids characters just feels a little rote. There's still some funny gags, thanks to Raido's bizarre worry about “wild beasts” and losing to a grade schooler at Reversi. But overall seeing these two deal with bratty kids just isn't as interesting compared to when they're getting up to nonsense on their own. We do at least end things with a good gag about Aharen riding her mighty steed (read: big dog) to close it all out, but Aharen-san is at its best when it's delivering deadpan absurdity. Arguing with little kids is something I could get from a bunch of different comedies, and I'd much rather see Tobaro or Oshiro return before these kids.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank.

I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.

24-04-2022,anime,3,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/in-the-heart-of-kunoichi-tsubaki/.183647,In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort.

(Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them?
