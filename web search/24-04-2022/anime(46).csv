Never seemed to have much staying power even when all branches were in it.  People I know largely stopped playing after a month or two of release.

Back to top                  omoikane    Joined: 03 Oct 2005 		    Posts: 472       Posted: Sat Apr 23, 2022 1:35 pm            I think the monetization strategy early on was a huge turn-off and many Producers stopped caring.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?

He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.

I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.

Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.

24-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aoashi/.183645,Aoashi - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Aoashi ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.

He was 69. His family held a private funeral.    According to the Asahi Shimbun's source, Murao had been fighting an unspecified illness for the past three years.    Murao was born in Tokushima prefecture in 1952. He made his manga creator debut with the ""Kappa Love Love Daisakusen"" manga in Shueisha's Bessatsu Shonen Jump magazine in 1972.    Murao's Futago Banzai manga earned an honorable mention in Shueisha's Tezuka Award in 1974. His other notable manga include Mune Sawagi no Hōkago, Binetsu My Love, Circle Game, Virgin Mama, Women, and S to M. Murao was also a character designer for the ""Bedroom Suburb"" and ""Theater of Life"" shorts for the 1986 anime anthology Seishun Anime Zenshu.    Murao launched the Dorei Sensei (seen right) manga with artist Hiro Tomono in Nihon Bungeisha's Manga Goraku Special magazine last year. The manga's first volume only recently shipped on March 19.

Review   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 17th 2022       Odd Taxi: In the Woods                      Synopsis:             The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.      Review:         Synopsis:        The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.     Review:            Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week. Now it's back as a (mostly) recap film, which mainly serves to tie up some loose ends from the TV anime's ending. Is it worth the full price of a cinema admission ticket? Well, perhaps not, but it's a fun way to revisit the series if it ends up streaming on Crunchyroll.    The original Odd Taxi was a meticulously plotted television serial, which slowly built up its mystery over the course of its run. Obviously, a film retelling can't capture the deliberate sense of pacing, nor can it recreate the atmosphere inside Odokawa's taxi, where the characters have hesitant, rambling, and inadvertently revealing conversations. Nevertheless, by cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right.    If Odd Taxi was a crime drama, then Odd Taxi: In the Woods evokes the feeling of a true crime documentary. The characters offer their subjective commentary on the events, recontextualizing the accompanying footage from the original TV anime. It's also a deft way of providing a coda to the saga without engaging in an extended epilogue sequence. ""What are these characters up to now?"" is answered in how they carry themselves in the interviews: whether they look back on their involvement with shame or confusion, or if they've come to terms with themselves in the meantime. Little details like how the characters sit or what kind of beverage they order add to the non-verbal storytelling.    Under this format, the film zips along at a good pace, telling a digest version of the story without spoiling the mystery. It makes its intentions clear from the start that it's about finding answers regarding the incident (i.e. the original anime's climax). Instead of teasing viewers for weeks about where all of these seemingly disconnected events will eventually lead to, the film quickly and efficiently begins threading it all together—but not so obviously that all the answers are immediately evident from the start.    The omissions and abridgements aren't too glaring in this narrative structure. Character interactions inevitably suffered the most cutting, but enough banter remains that the emotional beats still land. Even returning viewers who are reluctant to revisit a mystery they already know the answers to will probably find something fresh about the presentation here. The most disorienting part of the film is probably the start, as it flits rapidly through multiple character perspectives before eventually finding its pace. It's two hours long, but the time goes by in a flash.    As for the new epilogue, it shows what happens immediately after the TV anime's final scene. The ending credits also show snippets of the characters' lives afterwards. It's a bit of extra closure to a series that originally had an open-ended conclusion, but not anything that a viewer couldn't have imagined for themselves. Those who go into this film expecting surprises will probably be the most disappointed.    Ultimately, a recap film with only a bit of extra new footage is hard to evaluate. It's a perfectly reasonable way to experience the story of Odd Taxi for the first time, which is the most one could ask for. While it gets maximum mileage out of just a handful of new drawings, it still mainly exists as an alternate revenue stream for dedicated fans to support the series. New viewers should still default to the TV anime as the most complete telling, but by all means, check out this film if you're in the mood to rewatch a great series with a fresh perspective.

Review   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 17th 2022       Odd Taxi: In the Woods                      Synopsis:             The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.      Review:         Synopsis:        The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.     Review:            Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week. Now it's back as a (mostly) recap film, which mainly serves to tie up some loose ends from the TV anime's ending. Is it worth the full price of a cinema admission ticket? Well, perhaps not, but it's a fun way to revisit the series if it ends up streaming on Crunchyroll.    The original Odd Taxi was a meticulously plotted television serial, which slowly built up its mystery over the course of its run. Obviously, a film retelling can't capture the deliberate sense of pacing, nor can it recreate the atmosphere inside Odokawa's taxi, where the characters have hesitant, rambling, and inadvertently revealing conversations. Nevertheless, by cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right.    If Odd Taxi was a crime drama, then Odd Taxi: In the Woods evokes the feeling of a true crime documentary. The characters offer their subjective commentary on the events, recontextualizing the accompanying footage from the original TV anime. It's also a deft way of providing a coda to the saga without engaging in an extended epilogue sequence. ""What are these characters up to now?"" is answered in how they carry themselves in the interviews: whether they look back on their involvement with shame or confusion, or if they've come to terms with themselves in the meantime. Little details like how the characters sit or what kind of beverage they order add to the non-verbal storytelling.    Under this format, the film zips along at a good pace, telling a digest version of the story without spoiling the mystery. It makes its intentions clear from the start that it's about finding answers regarding the incident (i.e. the original anime's climax). Instead of teasing viewers for weeks about where all of these seemingly disconnected events will eventually lead to, the film quickly and efficiently begins threading it all together—but not so obviously that all the answers are immediately evident from the start.    The omissions and abridgements aren't too glaring in this narrative structure. Character interactions inevitably suffered the most cutting, but enough banter remains that the emotional beats still land. Even returning viewers who are reluctant to revisit a mystery they already know the answers to will probably find something fresh about the presentation here. The most disorienting part of the film is probably the start, as it flits rapidly through multiple character perspectives before eventually finding its pace. It's two hours long, but the time goes by in a flash.    As for the new epilogue, it shows what happens immediately after the TV anime's final scene. The ending credits also show snippets of the characters' lives afterwards. It's a bit of extra closure to a series that originally had an open-ended conclusion, but not anything that a viewer couldn't have imagined for themselves. Those who go into this film expecting surprises will probably be the most disappointed.    Ultimately, a recap film with only a bit of extra new footage is hard to evaluate. It's a perfectly reasonable way to experience the story of Odd Taxi for the first time, which is the most one could ask for. While it gets maximum mileage out of just a handful of new drawings, it still mainly exists as an alternate revenue stream for dedicated fans to support the series. New viewers should still default to the TV anime as the most complete telling, but by all means, check out this film if you're in the mood to rewatch a great series with a fresh perspective.

Review   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 17th 2022       Odd Taxi: In the Woods                      Synopsis:             The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.      Review:         Synopsis:        The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.     Review:            Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week. Now it's back as a (mostly) recap film, which mainly serves to tie up some loose ends from the TV anime's ending. Is it worth the full price of a cinema admission ticket? Well, perhaps not, but it's a fun way to revisit the series if it ends up streaming on Crunchyroll.    The original Odd Taxi was a meticulously plotted television serial, which slowly built up its mystery over the course of its run. Obviously, a film retelling can't capture the deliberate sense of pacing, nor can it recreate the atmosphere inside Odokawa's taxi, where the characters have hesitant, rambling, and inadvertently revealing conversations. Nevertheless, by cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right.    If Odd Taxi was a crime drama, then Odd Taxi: In the Woods evokes the feeling of a true crime documentary. The characters offer their subjective commentary on the events, recontextualizing the accompanying footage from the original TV anime. It's also a deft way of providing a coda to the saga without engaging in an extended epilogue sequence. ""What are these characters up to now?"" is answered in how they carry themselves in the interviews: whether they look back on their involvement with shame or confusion, or if they've come to terms with themselves in the meantime. Little details like how the characters sit or what kind of beverage they order add to the non-verbal storytelling.    Under this format, the film zips along at a good pace, telling a digest version of the story without spoiling the mystery. It makes its intentions clear from the start that it's about finding answers regarding the incident (i.e. the original anime's climax). Instead of teasing viewers for weeks about where all of these seemingly disconnected events will eventually lead to, the film quickly and efficiently begins threading it all together—but not so obviously that all the answers are immediately evident from the start.    The omissions and abridgements aren't too glaring in this narrative structure. Character interactions inevitably suffered the most cutting, but enough banter remains that the emotional beats still land. Even returning viewers who are reluctant to revisit a mystery they already know the answers to will probably find something fresh about the presentation here. The most disorienting part of the film is probably the start, as it flits rapidly through multiple character perspectives before eventually finding its pace. It's two hours long, but the time goes by in a flash.    As for the new epilogue, it shows what happens immediately after the TV anime's final scene. The ending credits also show snippets of the characters' lives afterwards. It's a bit of extra closure to a series that originally had an open-ended conclusion, but not anything that a viewer couldn't have imagined for themselves. Those who go into this film expecting surprises will probably be the most disappointed.    Ultimately, a recap film with only a bit of extra new footage is hard to evaluate. It's a perfectly reasonable way to experience the story of Odd Taxi for the first time, which is the most one could ask for. While it gets maximum mileage out of just a handful of new drawings, it still mainly exists as an alternate revenue stream for dedicated fans to support the series. New viewers should still default to the TV anime as the most complete telling, but by all means, check out this film if you're in the mood to rewatch a great series with a fresh perspective.

Review   by Kim Morrissy, Apr 17th 2022       Odd Taxi: In the Woods                      Synopsis:             The film is a ""reconstruction"" of the television anime episodes, but it also depicts what happens after the television anime's finale. The story follows Odokawa, an eccentric, reticent 41-year-old taxi driver who has no relatives and does not have much to do with others. He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.

He does have conversations with his customers, including a college student who wants to go viral, a nurse hiding a secret, an unsuccessful comedian, a street rough, and an up-and-coming idol. These conversations lead him to a girl who has disappeared.     Review:            Odd Taxi was 2021's sleeper anime hit, telling an intricate, original mystery that kept viewers guessing every week. Now it's back as a (mostly) recap film, which mainly serves to tie up some loose ends from the TV anime's ending. Is it worth the full price of a cinema admission ticket? Well, perhaps not, but it's a fun way to revisit the series if it ends up streaming on Crunchyroll.    The original Odd Taxi was a meticulously plotted television serial, which slowly built up its mystery over the course of its run. Obviously, a film retelling can't capture the deliberate sense of pacing, nor can it recreate the atmosphere inside Odokawa's taxi, where the characters have hesitant, rambling, and inadvertently revealing conversations. Nevertheless, by cleverly reframing its narrative around a series of interviews with the supporting cast, Odd Taxi: In the Woods succeeds where most recap films fail: it's an artistically cohesive film in its own right.    If Odd Taxi was a crime drama, then Odd Taxi: In the Woods evokes the feeling of a true crime documentary. The characters offer their subjective commentary on the events, recontextualizing the accompanying footage from the original TV anime. It's also a deft way of providing a coda to the saga without engaging in an extended epilogue sequence. ""What are these characters up to now?"" is answered in how they carry themselves in the interviews: whether they look back on their involvement with shame or confusion, or if they've come to terms with themselves in the meantime. Little details like how the characters sit or what kind of beverage they order add to the non-verbal storytelling.    Under this format, the film zips along at a good pace, telling a digest version of the story without spoiling the mystery. It makes its intentions clear from the start that it's about finding answers regarding the incident (i.e. the original anime's climax). Instead of teasing viewers for weeks about where all of these seemingly disconnected events will eventually lead to, the film quickly and efficiently begins threading it all together—but not so obviously that all the answers are immediately evident from the start.    The omissions and abridgements aren't too glaring in this narrative structure. Character interactions inevitably suffered the most cutting, but enough banter remains that the emotional beats still land. Even returning viewers who are reluctant to revisit a mystery they already know the answers to will probably find something fresh about the presentation here. The most disorienting part of the film is probably the start, as it flits rapidly through multiple character perspectives before eventually finding its pace. It's two hours long, but the time goes by in a flash.    As for the new epilogue, it shows what happens immediately after the TV anime's final scene. The ending credits also show snippets of the characters' lives afterwards. It's a bit of extra closure to a series that originally had an open-ended conclusion, but not anything that a viewer couldn't have imagined for themselves. Those who go into this film expecting surprises will probably be the most disappointed.    Ultimately, a recap film with only a bit of extra new footage is hard to evaluate. It's a perfectly reasonable way to experience the story of Odd Taxi for the first time, which is the most one could ask for. While it gets maximum mileage out of just a handful of new drawings, it still mainly exists as an alternate revenue stream for dedicated fans to support the series. New viewers should still default to the TV anime as the most complete telling, but by all means, check out this film if you're in the mood to rewatch a great series with a fresh perspective.

Little details like how the characters sit or what kind of beverage they order add to the non-verbal storytelling.    Under this format, the film zips along at a good pace, telling a digest version of the story without spoiling the mystery. It makes its intentions clear from the start that it's about finding answers regarding the incident (i.e. the original anime's climax). Instead of teasing viewers for weeks about where all of these seemingly disconnected events will eventually lead to, the film quickly and efficiently begins threading it all together—but not so obviously that all the answers are immediately evident from the start.    The omissions and abridgements aren't too glaring in this narrative structure. Character interactions inevitably suffered the most cutting, but enough banter remains that the emotional beats still land. Even returning viewers who are reluctant to revisit a mystery they already know the answers to will probably find something fresh about the presentation here. The most disorienting part of the film is probably the start, as it flits rapidly through multiple character perspectives before eventually finding its pace. It's two hours long, but the time goes by in a flash.    As for the new epilogue, it shows what happens immediately after the TV anime's final scene. The ending credits also show snippets of the characters' lives afterwards. It's a bit of extra closure to a series that originally had an open-ended conclusion, but not anything that a viewer couldn't have imagined for themselves. Those who go into this film expecting surprises will probably be the most disappointed.    Ultimately, a recap film with only a bit of extra new footage is hard to evaluate. It's a perfectly reasonable way to experience the story of Odd Taxi for the first time, which is the most one could ask for. While it gets maximum mileage out of just a handful of new drawings, it still mainly exists as an alternate revenue stream for dedicated fans to support the series. New viewers should still default to the TV anime as the most complete telling, but by all means, check out this film if you're in the mood to rewatch a great series with a fresh perspective.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

SHD wrote:    ...Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.           Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma volume 1 game launched on September 2015.

News Exclusive: Titan Comics Unveils 2nd Volume Cover for Afro Samurai Director's Cut Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 04:05 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         2nd volume launches on October 4    Titan Comics revealed to ANN the cover for the second volume of the new director's cut edition of Takashi Okazaki's 1999 Afro Samurai seinen manga. The second volume launches on October 4.     The first volume of the director's cut edition will launch on July 26. The new edition will feature specially commissioned cover art and a foreword by Okazaki.    The release commemorates the 15th anniversary of the anime adaptation. It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The Afro Samurai 2: Revenge of Kuma volume 1 game launched on September 2015.

It is available for pre-order on retail websites such as Amazon and Forbidden Planet.    Titan Comics describes the story:  Inspired by Okazaki-san's love of hip hop music and American pop culture, the story, set in a feudal futuristic Japan, follows the young Afro Samurai who witnesses his father, the holder of the No.1 headband, being challenged and killed by the No.2 – a lethal gunslinger named Justice. Swearing revenge, he starts off on a bloody path of retribution that will eventually make him the No.2 warrior and lead to a final dramatic face-off with his father's killer.  Seven Seas Entertainment released the manga in North America.    Animation studio Gonzo adapted the manga into the Afro Samurai television mini-series (2007) and later into the Afro Samurai: Resurrection television movie (2009). Both anime projects became the bestselling anime DVD releases of their respective years. Funimation released the anime adaptations.    Namco Bandai Games released the Afro Samurai videogame adaptation in North America and Europe in 2009 for the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.

Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6            Can I just say these kids are terrifying?  Not just because of the amount of psychological and manipulative power they seem to have over each other, but also because of their extreme disconnect with reality. I'm joking – mostly – and watching these teenagers operate under extremes, pretending they know more about everything going on than they actually do, is obviously a large part of Kaguya-sama's appeal. I guess I just wasn't expecting this episode to start as dark as it did; the opening scene where the girls are breaking down the concept of cheating with a dead, almost violent look in their eyes made me laugh nervously. That said, I like the fact that there is a narrative progression to the three skits that made up this episode, allowing them to flow from one into the other. The first skit set up a conflict that needed to be resolved, the second introduces a character involved in that conflict and their mindset with some foreshadowing for things to come, and the third built upon some of the best parts of last week's episode.    Although I guess it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the character in the second skit is new, considering that we have technically seen her in almost every single episode of the show. That's right: the girl in the background that is always stalking that one couple who represents how great things could have been if some of these characters were just honest with themselves is finally given a name. Suffice to say it's surprising that she holds some kind of connection with Kaguya by being a member of the Shinomiya branch family. The show makes it a point that they are distant relatives, but the fact that said connection is a defining feature of her introduction made me think that there will be bigger plans for her down the road, possibly relating to some of Kaguya's family struggles that were hinted at in previous seasons. I also appreciated how the final skit ended, which is not only wholesome, but capped this episode off as one of the most narratively consistent of the season so far.

Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6            Can I just say these kids are terrifying?  Not just because of the amount of psychological and manipulative power they seem to have over each other, but also because of their extreme disconnect with reality. I'm joking – mostly – and watching these teenagers operate under extremes, pretending they know more about everything going on than they actually do, is obviously a large part of Kaguya-sama's appeal. I guess I just wasn't expecting this episode to start as dark as it did; the opening scene where the girls are breaking down the concept of cheating with a dead, almost violent look in their eyes made me laugh nervously. That said, I like the fact that there is a narrative progression to the three skits that made up this episode, allowing them to flow from one into the other. The first skit set up a conflict that needed to be resolved, the second introduces a character involved in that conflict and their mindset with some foreshadowing for things to come, and the third built upon some of the best parts of last week's episode.    Although I guess it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the character in the second skit is new, considering that we have technically seen her in almost every single episode of the show. That's right: the girl in the background that is always stalking that one couple who represents how great things could have been if some of these characters were just honest with themselves is finally given a name. Suffice to say it's surprising that she holds some kind of connection with Kaguya by being a member of the Shinomiya branch family. The show makes it a point that they are distant relatives, but the fact that said connection is a defining feature of her introduction made me think that there will be bigger plans for her down the road, possibly relating to some of Kaguya's family struggles that were hinted at in previous seasons. I also appreciated how the final skit ended, which is not only wholesome, but capped this episode off as one of the most narratively consistent of the season so far.

Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ?                     Community score: 4.6            Can I just say these kids are terrifying?  Not just because of the amount of psychological and manipulative power they seem to have over each other, but also because of their extreme disconnect with reality. I'm joking – mostly – and watching these teenagers operate under extremes, pretending they know more about everything going on than they actually do, is obviously a large part of Kaguya-sama's appeal. I guess I just wasn't expecting this episode to start as dark as it did; the opening scene where the girls are breaking down the concept of cheating with a dead, almost violent look in their eyes made me laugh nervously. That said, I like the fact that there is a narrative progression to the three skits that made up this episode, allowing them to flow from one into the other. The first skit set up a conflict that needed to be resolved, the second introduces a character involved in that conflict and their mindset with some foreshadowing for things to come, and the third built upon some of the best parts of last week's episode.    Although I guess it would be a bit of a stretch to say that the character in the second skit is new, considering that we have technically seen her in almost every single episode of the show. That's right: the girl in the background that is always stalking that one couple who represents how great things could have been if some of these characters were just honest with themselves is finally given a name. Suffice to say it's surprising that she holds some kind of connection with Kaguya by being a member of the Shinomiya branch family. The show makes it a point that they are distant relatives, but the fact that said connection is a defining feature of her introduction made me think that there will be bigger plans for her down the road, possibly relating to some of Kaguya's family struggles that were hinted at in previous seasons. I also appreciated how the final skit ended, which is not only wholesome, but capped this episode off as one of the most narratively consistent of the season so far.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child. Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father.

Moreover, Ard doesn't really learn his lesson. Instead, he lucks into becoming Litz's friend by rescuing her from danger and getting her to open up about being friendless herself.    Lacking any kind of teachable moral or character growth, I'm not sure what this anime is trying to say or where it plans on going in the future. This might have been one of those shows that should have started in media res, because as it stands now, I have no idea.       Caitlin Moore  Rating:                You know, I have to hand it to light novel anime: every time a cliché dies out, a new one pops up to take its place. How many series in the last few years have there been where a powerful mage (often, but not always a demon lord) decides he's weary of his life at the top and decides to be reincarnated? And then, in his new era, he discovers that magic has degraded significantly since his reign but he's just as powerful as ever? Also he struggles socially but has one or two devoted female friends/followers? I'm ready to declare this overdone, and The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is just yet another entry into the trend.    If you're into series of this ilk, it's not too bad a premiere. Ard's social struggles come from a mix of overenthusiasm and lack of skill, which is much more entertaining than his stone-faced equivalents. It's a little puzzling, though, how he ended up ten years old, raised by a nice, normal family in what appears to be a good neighborhood full of children, seemingly without ever having talked to a child his age. The effect is more that Ard sprung fully formed into his ten-year-old body, rather than having been born and raised in it. Maybe it's intentional? But the flashbacks to him studying magic and practicing sword indicate that no, he really is ten years old. It even turns out that the girl he spent most of the episode pursuing is the daughter of his parents' best friend, who he has somehow never met before despite being familiar with her father.    Speaking of Ireena, his dogged pursuit of her is what gave me the most misgivings about the episode. It's played for comedy, but I'm not comfortable with a little boy chasing after a little girl while she screams for him to leave her alone. When this became the main joke about ten minutes in, I had to fight not to check out. Even without the cultural baggage, it was repetitive and unfunny, and went on for almost half the episode. When she was surrounded by goblins and obliquely threatened with rape (they only showed little girls running from them), it took all my power not to turn off the episode.    The other parts of the episode aren't too bad. Ard's parents seem like good, caring people, as does Ireena's father. The jokes about Ard trying and failing to connect to the other children aren't especially funny, but some of the visual gags got a chuckle out of me. But boy, does he spend a lot of time chasing Ireena. No thanks.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I remember roughly two things from reading the first light novel this series is based on: that it was very dull and that the title was awfully misleading. While I don't feel that this was quite as boring as I thought the book was, the title thing is still an issue, albeit a nit-picky one, because while Ard is absolutely something of a nobody, he's in no way at all typical. I suppose that could be the point – that in his previous life as Varvatos, a human who won the appellation of “demon lord” for his prowess and fear factor, Ard was so out of touch with what “normal” and “typical” were that when he was reborn with his memories intact, he remained blissfully ignorant. But I can't help but feel that Ard's absurd levels of power and overwrought manner of speaking isn't helping the series that much, instead giving him leave to be the typical overpowered protagonist, albeit one with the social skills of a radish.    There is something a little sad about that, of course. Varvatos seems to have been in the same position as Leo from I'm Quitting Heroing in that his skill only served to make people fear him. Varvatos got to rule while Leo was kicked out of the kingdom, but both seem to be looking for friendship and acceptance that isn't forthcoming. As Ard, the former demon lord at least has some very loving parents (even if they seem more into each other than invested in their kid), but that doesn't translate into him having any luck at making friends. Largely that's because he's the most unchildlike child in the entire village – even Ireena (who is probably the reincarnation of Lydia, Varvatos' queen) does a better job being a kid while being ludicrously powerful; Ard is basically the anime incarnation of the old “hello, fellow kids” meme. Presumably this is meant to be funny, but I'm with the rest of the village children that it comes off as a bit creepy – especially once Ard focuses his friendly ardor on Ireena. Of course, once they “grow up” Ireena's doing the old “sneak into his bed when she comes to see him in the morning” routine, so my sense of creepy may be skewed.    But hey, if you're not content to watch a reborn adult continue acting like an adult in a child's body while exercising a ridiculous amount of magical power, don't worry! Because it looks like we're headed into magical school territory very soon. Even if this looked better or had a better executed story it's hard not to compare it to roughly half a dozen other similar shows that had slightly better hooks, and while it isn't precisely a bad episode, it's also not really a good one either. Since the story does look to be headed in a relatively different direction with episode two, it may be worth the three episode test to see where the plot settles, but otherwise there really isn't much here to recommend it, the entertaining scene of Ard snapping his fingers and frying monster hordes behind him notwithstanding.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               It's always weird when a show manages to exceed your expectations, but still can't make it all the way up the stairs to being good. I went into The Greatest Demon Lord blah blah blah expecting basically the same show as last season's The Strongest Sage With the Weakest Crest, and that wound up being half true. There's still a plainfaced, OP potato boy at the center of things who has all his memories of being the biggest badass to ever wield a magic circle, and by the end of this episode he's on his way to both magic school and a harem of adoring anime girls to impress. But along the way there are at least a few sparks of charm that made it an overall more memorable watch than a lot of these kinds of shows.    Pretty much all of that comes down to Ard and his pre-pubescent demon lord shtick. The guy talks like a total weenie, and seeing a grown man in a child's body completely fumble through basic conversation is pretty funny. Small gags like monsters attacking him in the background only to be set ablaze by a snap of the fingers are silly enough to complement the goofy tone of his quest for friendship without being overbearing. And there's genuinely something funny about his first friend hating his guts for most of the premiere and fleeing from him in the streets. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and if you start thinking about it you do feel a little icky about a grown man chasing a little girl around in spite of her constant protests, but on a basic comedy level it at least gives this show some personality.    That's something it's desperately lacking everywhere else. The visuals are cheap and rough, failing to sell any of the action or even the basic visual of Ard flying. Character designs are that particular kind of generic that would let you slot them into damn near any LN fantasy world without trouble, and they leave basically no impression. Once the jokes stop and the show tries to be serious and emotional, it becomes a slog. Ard and Ireena are flat and boring archetypes, and despite the show's best(?) efforts there's no weight to their eventual friendship, especially once we skip to their teenage years and she's clearly in love with him, as all anime girls must be in the presence of a potatoman.    So yeah, “better than expected” is sadly not the same as “good” and this premiere is here to prove it. This wasn't as hefty a chore as I figured going in, but that just means it felt like taking out the trash rather than mowing the lawn.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The greatest demon lord in all of history, Varvatos, has reigned for several millennia as an absolute ruler. Now, there's only one thing left for him to do: enjoy the life of an average commoner. When he's reincarnated as a villager in a non-descript town, everything seems to be going as he hoped, but there's just one slight problem—even when he holds back, Varvatos is still too strong. Soon, rumors about him spread, and he's approached by all sorts of men, women, and assailants.    The Greatest Demon Lord is Reborn as a Typical Nobody is based on Myōjin Katō's novels and streams on Crunchyroll.      How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                Hands down, this was one of the cringiest 22 minutes of anime I have ever watched—and I am certain that is by design. Ard is a reincarnated Demon Lord who had no equals in his past life and, thus, no friends. He sees his position as the reason he was friendless, but as we see in this episode, that's not really the case.    Rather, Ard's problem is that he lacks social skills. And like many who share that problem, he is searching for a set of hard and fast rules to follow when meeting people. Unfortunately, no such thing exists. This is only exacerbated by his tendency to deal in extremes. When talking down to potential friends as their superior doesn't get the results he wants, he talks like a knight addressing a princess. Worse still is that he keeps trying over and over on the same people. It's trying to cross a bridge that is already burnt. He's already a wierdo in their eyes, yet Ard truly believes if he can find the right words, all will work out just as he intends.    And let's face it, to anyone who is or was socially awkward, Ard's struggles are relatable—that's the main reason it's so cringey. In fact, even the whole thing where he badgers Litz incessantly, might have been cute if it weren't for the fact that he is a 40+ year-old man stalking a literal child.

It's kinds weird that they're making an anime for a cancelled manga tho. The pacing should be better this time since flowers is a shorter series.

Yes five volume of a monthly manga series is enough to fill up a one hour season. If anything, they'll probably speed through the material since 12 episodes is a pretty tight limit to adapt everything.

I don't quite remember whether the Flowers manga has gotten far enough to establish the conflict of the story... so partial manga adaptation with anime original ending?

Flowers is actually only the first arc of the bigger SK sequel project. The 2018 manga Shaman King The Super Star is a direct sequel to Flowers, and all the other manga projects which started (and some also completed) since 2018 all fit into this new story divided on different series (Red Crimson and Marcos, in particular).  Now, the new trailer clearly shows the beginning to Flowers, but as the name of the new anime hasn't been stated yet, it could very well adapt also some of the newer projects.  All of the newer series should also been published in English as well, if you want to read them!

I haven’t kept up with the many Shaman King series that have been released since Flowers ended, so I just assumed they were side stories.

So presumably they'll adapt Flowers as is with Super Star a question for a later point in the future.

It's kinds weird that they're making an anime for a cancelled manga tho. The pacing should be better this time since flowers is a shorter series.

Yes five volume of a monthly manga series is enough to fill up a one hour season. If anything, they'll probably speed through the material since 12 episodes is a pretty tight limit to adapt everything.

I don't quite remember whether the Flowers manga has gotten far enough to establish the conflict of the story... so partial manga adaptation with anime original ending?

Flowers is actually only the first arc of the bigger SK sequel project. The 2018 manga Shaman King The Super Star is a direct sequel to Flowers, and all the other manga projects which started (and some also completed) since 2018 all fit into this new story divided on different series (Red Crimson and Marcos, in particular).  Now, the new trailer clearly shows the beginning to Flowers, but as the name of the new anime hasn't been stated yet, it could very well adapt also some of the newer projects.  All of the newer series should also been published in English as well, if you want to read them!

I haven’t kept up with the many Shaman King series that have been released since Flowers ended, so I just assumed they were side stories.

So presumably they'll adapt Flowers as is with Super Star a question for a later point in the future.

Yes five volume of a monthly manga series is enough to fill up a one hour season.

Flowers is actually only the first arc of the bigger SK sequel project. The 2018 manga Shaman King The Super Star is a direct sequel to Flowers, and all the other manga projects which started (and some also completed) since 2018 all fit into this new story divided on different series (Red Crimson and Marcos, in particular).  Now, the new trailer clearly shows the beginning to Flowers, but as the name of the new anime hasn't been stated yet, it could very well adapt also some of the newer projects.  All of the newer series should also been published in English as well, if you want to read them!

So presumably they'll adapt Flowers as is with Super Star a question for a later point in the future.

Flowers is actually only the first arc of the bigger SK sequel project. The 2018 manga Shaman King The Super Star is a direct sequel to Flowers, and all the other manga projects which started (and some also completed) since 2018 all fit into this new story divided on different series (Red Crimson and Marcos, in particular).  Now, the new trailer clearly shows the beginning to Flowers, but as the name of the new anime hasn't been stated yet, it could very well adapt also some of the newer projects.  All of the newer series should also been published in English as well, if you want to read them!

Flowers is actually only the first arc of the bigger SK sequel project. The 2018 manga Shaman King The Super Star is a direct sequel to Flowers, and all the other manga projects which started (and some also completed) since 2018 all fit into this new story divided on different series (Red Crimson and Marcos, in particular).  Now, the new trailer clearly shows the beginning to Flowers, but as the name of the new anime hasn't been stated yet, it could very well adapt also some of the newer projects.

Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          6 comments       The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 ‒ Episode 3   Apr 24, 03:30 6 comments                 anime    Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.                    ep. review          6 comments       Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ‒ Episode 4   Apr 24, 02:30 6 comments                 anime    We get some amazing fashion choices courtesy of Raido's imagination, hear some decently funny bars from our leads, and then we get out before anyone starts having Hypnosis Mic war flashbacks.                           ep. review          10 comments       Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ‒ Episode 3   Apr 24, 01:30 10 comments                 anime    Kaguya reveals her terrifying side as the subject of what constitutes cheating becomes the focus on this episode.                    ep. review          18 comments       The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ‒ Episode 3   Apr 24, 00:31 18 comments                 anime    Naofumi and co. face off against the destructive turtle, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode doesn't have the impact that it could.                    review          8 comments       Muteking The Dancing Hero   Apr 24, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    Watch an episode or two of Muteking and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life. ― If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking The Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrifie...                    ep. review          8 comments       Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision ‒ Episode 30   Apr 23, 03:30 8 comments                 anime    It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan.                    ep. review          6 comments       Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 23, 02:30 6 comments                 anime    Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb.

Satoshi Kon has one of the most impressive filmographies of any animator, but what of his 13-episode television series? Some call it a masterpiece, others call it pretentious, Matthew Roe heads back to Studio Madhouse to take a look at Paranoia Agent.        This Week in Games - Nintendo and Sega, How Could You? Micro-transactions and union-busting top the news this week as we try to figure out which Sonic Origins version to buy to get the whole game.        This Week in Anime - What the Hell is Going On in Estab Life?  Estab Life: Great Escape defies explanation. A penguin Eastern bloc, a slime girl obsessed with underpants, and not an iota of sense in sight. Steve and Nick try to make sense of this entertainingly incoherent mess of a show.        Why Girls und Panzer Works So Well Who would've thought that a series about high school girls in short skirts fighting tank battles would be the peak of military-themed anime?  « »     Views        — Archives —                  Filters          All Southeast Asia  •  Anime Manga Novels Games Music Merch Events Industry People Live-Action COVID-19           Text-only Compact View             Text-only List View             Text-only Grid View             List View with Images             Grid View with Images                               ep. review          6 comments       The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2 ‒ Episode 3   Apr 24, 03:30 6 comments                 anime    Come for the funny jokes, and stay for the sincere and surprisingly deep story of a bunch of lonely girls that are doing their best to learn how to love and be loved again.                    ep. review          6 comments       Aharen-san wa Hakarenai ‒ Episode 4   Apr 24, 02:30 6 comments                 anime    We get some amazing fashion choices courtesy of Raido's imagination, hear some decently funny bars from our leads, and then we get out before anyone starts having Hypnosis Mic war flashbacks.                           ep. review          10 comments       Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic- ‒ Episode 3   Apr 24, 01:30 10 comments                 anime    Kaguya reveals her terrifying side as the subject of what constitutes cheating becomes the focus on this episode.                    ep. review          18 comments       The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ‒ Episode 3   Apr 24, 00:31 18 comments                 anime    Naofumi and co. face off against the destructive turtle, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode doesn't have the impact that it could.                    review          8 comments       Muteking The Dancing Hero   Apr 24, 00:00 8 comments                 anime    Watch an episode or two of Muteking and it becomes abundantly transparent that there is no subtlety to the clear and direct parallels between the show's story and what is happening in real life. ― If you haven't seen a single episode of Muteking The Dancing Hero, you may think I'm making it up, or that I'm imposing Western values onto the show when I say that it's about how technocrats have gentrifie...                    ep. review          8 comments       Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision ‒ Episode 30   Apr 23, 03:30 8 comments                 anime    It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan.                    ep. review          6 comments       Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ‒ SERIES PREMIERE   Apr 23, 02:30 6 comments                 anime    Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb.
