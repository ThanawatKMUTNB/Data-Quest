REVIEW: Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        njprogfan   Collector Extraordinaire   Joined: 08 Feb 2007 		    Posts: 867 		    Location: A River Named Toms 		        Posted: Fri Apr 22, 2022 2:39 pm            I was skeptical having this show on my watch list, but I love perky plucky hardworking female protagonists like Hiyori especially when they're drawn NOT to look very pretty or cute. I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Like I get they seem to be going through stuff and she's honestly just there to baby sit them and be their go-pher. But they are almost always actively terrible people not only to her but everyone else   I mean you can have bad boy or troubled leads totally, but they do like nothing to make these two just hateful and annoyed.

If Hiyori is ""Cinderella"" they're basically meant to be her wicked steps sister's, you not finding them appealing is pretty much on purpose.

I love the source material, I'm loving seeing where the anime is taking the plot, and I can't wait to see what comes next! We all should love the precious potato eyebrow girl.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.     I don't want to say that you're supposed to hate them, though only because they have their own storylines separate from Hiyori and they're definitely not solely supposed to be disliked.

I have greatly appreciated your writeups thus far, because there's a lot of context to cram.

I fully confess that I have problematic taste, because I love them at their absolute worst. Watching them drop the act and verbally destroy Yumeru was the perfect capstone on the three-episode test. These boys are perfect in every way. (Though I think Yujiro earned extra points with, ""If she tries anything, I'll destroy her career.""  )      Back to top                Display posts from previous: All Posts 1 Day 7 Days 2 Weeks 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year Oldest First Newest First              Anime News Network Forum Index     -> Site-related 	  -> Talkback  All times are GMT - 5 Hours    Page 1 of 1         	              Powered by phpBB © 2001, 2005 phpBB Group           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +       Forum     Jump to: Select a forum   Site-related ---------------- Announcements & The Rules Talkback Encyclopedia Bugs & Technical Questions ANN Feedback   General ---------------- Anime Series Discussion Manga Music Events Novels Video Games Polls Contests and Games   Industry ---------------- Retail   For Subscribers ---------------- Community Feature requests Collection Spotlight Personal Sales     You cannot post new topics in this forumYou cannot reply to topics in this forumYou cannot edit your posts in this forumYou cannot delete your posts in this forumYou cannot vote in polls in this forum                         news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Like I get they seem to be going through stuff and she's honestly just there to baby sit them and be their go-pher.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.     I don't want to say that you're supposed to hate them, though only because they have their own storylines separate from Hiyori and they're definitely not solely supposed to be disliked.

I fully confess that I have problematic taste, because I love them at their absolute worst. Watching them drop the act and verbally destroy Yumeru was the perfect capstone on the three-episode test. These boys are perfect in every way.

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit!

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male.

The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.

Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs   Apr  4th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.

I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet.

A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued.

This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.        James Beckett  Rating:               I've come to learn that, of all the variations of the modern isekai anime that have cropped up over the years, I tend to prefer the ones where characters get trapped in dating sims and the like. The generic MMORPG worlds that so many of the other isekai trade in bore me to tears, and the stories tend to lack focus and direction on account of the open-ended natures of the video games that the stories are riffing on. When a gal or guy gets reincarnated into a dating sim, though, we have a set cast of characters and plot with more momentum right off the bat, and the characters' knowledge of the game has to be a little more specific than simply having memorized a thousand menus and sub-systems. Granted, the point of cribbing from the tropes of popular dating sims still lies in the fact that the isekai stories are treading familiar ground, but if we must operate entirely within the bumper-lanes of old clichés, I'll settle for the somewhat more entertaining clichés.    For those reasons, I ended up having an okay time with Trapped in a Dating Sim, even if it never left me feeling particularly excited or intrigued. A lot of my reservations come from the episode being such an exposition dump; we don't even meet the other central characters of the dating game that Leon has found himself stuck in until the very final shots of the premiere. Until then, it's the Leon the Loner show from top to bottom. He's not an awful protagonist, but he's nothing new to the genre, either. He's prickly and socially awkward, but he also can't be too much of an asshole, since we still have to be impressed with how much he breaks the game using his Earthbound knowledge of its systems and plot. This means that the story of this premiere is essentially a linear chronicle of how Leon inserts himself into the main plot of the game, with most scenes consisting of Leon monologuing in explicit detail what he knows about the game, how he's going to manipulate it, etc. This is the kind of stuff I almost never find interesting, because it assumes that the joy of the isekai premise comes from having the protagonist narrate the condensed Wiki-entry version of a video game, and not, you know, letting us just watch the story happen in peace.    Still, the setting itself has some cool stuff going for it, namely in how it mixes the elements of its typical fantasy setting with mechs and other sci-fi trappings—always a nice touch. It could also very well be that the story picks up speed once Leon arrives at the academy where the game truly takes place and starts to mingle with all of the characters; it's hard to judge how strong a dating-game style story is going to be when you don't even know most of the ensemble yet. I might stick with Trapped in a Dating Sim for another episode or two, just to see if it ends up winning me over. I doubt it will be as fun as My Next Life as a Villainess, but who knows? Stranger things have happened!        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               We haven't really seen it reflected in anime yet, but in LN and manga scenes, the isekai subgenre is absolutely rife with Otome Game Villainess stories. You can throw a rock in any direction and are just as liable to hit a book about being reincarnated as the mean girl character in a video game as anything else. So it makes sense with that particular gimmick's proliferation that you'd start seeing stories intentionally twisting it for novelty. Thus we have this show, which attempts to pull the perspective away from the stereotypical nobles and upper class, and instead focus on what it's like to be an anonymous background character in one of these stories. Or, well, it sort of tries that, then gets bored immediately with that premise and more or less turns into a typical male-led isekai in the span of half an episode. Whoops.    The biggest weakness for this show is it just doesn't feel like its creators knew all that much about otome games. Stories like My Next Life as a Villainess or I'm in Love with the Villainess use their familiarity with the subgenre to gently (and sometimes harshly) mock the established conventions of them, but you get the impression those are jokes borne from somebody who deeply enjoys that type of media and spends a lot of time thinking about them. This show, on the other hand, doesn't seem to know much about the genre besides there being a female PC and a lot of hot dudes for her to sweet talk. Everything else is crammed in from other facets of gaming – RTS battles, power armor, sci-fi style airships, micro-transactions, all stuff that shows up in other games that has to be ham-fistedly crammed in here because that's what the creators are more familiar with.    I say all this not to call the creators phonies, but because that muddling of its own premise kind of kills the joke. This isn't a parody of otome games or a critical look at the genre from a new point of view, so none of its observations or gags have any teeth. Wow show, you're right, there sure are a lot of haughty pretty boys in games made for women. You really got them there. And yeah, some games aren't balanced very well so you're forced to spend real money on them. Can't remember ever playing an otome game where that was the case but uh, good dunk on...mobile games? What are we parodying here, again?    This even comes down to our protagonist, who spends three full days 100%ing the central game – not because he is a guy who likes otome games, but because his pushy little sister blackmailed him into playing it for her. Because she wants to see the ending CGs but doesn't actually want to play the game to get it, and apparently can't use Google to just look them up? It's a clunky, contrived way to allow a guy who hates otome games to still have all the knowledge necessary to cheat the system and get ahead in life, making him fundamentally identical to a regular isekai hero. So we've taken three lefts to make a right and arrive at a plain wayne isekai story, only now our male lead will have to build a harem of doting anime girls by showing up those handsome gigachads who make up the typical love interests.    Then there's the frankly flaccid attempts at role reversal with the game world's gender politics. See, in this game, it's women who hold all the power! So now MEN are the ones forced into loveless political marriages where they serve older, richer WOMEN who all have disposable male paramours. See, it's clever, because they did CTRL+F for the word “patriarchy” and then replaced the P with an M. My first impression upon seeing that part of the premise was that this would be a cringe-inducing setup for a victim complex to further fuel the main character's resentful snark, but I've read enough of the manga adaptation to know that's largely not the case. But that doesn't stop it from feeling like a lazy way to build a paper-thin world, which isn't a whole lot better.    Combined with stiff, sub-par animation and pacing that leaps from moment to moment with a bald-faced desperation, this one winds up a total mess. It's at once overstuffed and totally lacking in ideas, and has the gall to have its own protagonist complain about how much its world and story suck like it's somebody else's fault. It's just a flop all around.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               There's a particular type of guy out there who is seethingly angry at the idea of things that exist to play into women's fantasies. He doesn't take issue with media aimed at delivering male fantasies, oh no, but the very concept of media where the central aim is allowing women to indulge in the fantasy of being desirable to a range of hot men? Oh no, that cannot stand! Such things are truly detestable, and any girl who likes them is a shallow bitch.    I can't say that's for sure the case with whoever wrote Trapped in a Dating Sim, but it sure does come across that way. The protagonist, now known as Leon, beefed it on the staircase after his little sister blackmailed him into playing an otome game for three days straight while she went on Hawaii because… she wanted to hear the end conversation? Why not just go look it up? Why would she even care about it decontextualized from the rest of the game? (Or maybe that's just me.) What is this terrible secret she's holding over his head? Our little pre-Leon seems baffled that the game would have JRPG/science fiction/strategy elements, but considering my favorite genre of game is “visual novel with gameplay elements,” it doesn't seem remotely shocking. And why would it make him actively angry?    Then there's the issue of the matriarchal society. Why would that even be a thing in a dating sim? It's such a bizarre detail that has existed in absolutely none of the games I've played. That's the part that made me really get the feeling that whoever created this nonsense has never actually played an otome game, but is super angry that they exist. Pre-Leon grouses that the girls in the game are way too powerful, which shows up in the game world as women subjecting men to the exact same social oppression that women in the real world have been suffering under for centuries. Now, if it seemed like it had any actual intention of examining how things like economics arranged marriages between girls and much older men, that would be one thing, but it just leaves it as one of the reasons being in this world sucks for average men.    I hate being able to see the seams of constructed worlds, where you can see the structures designed specifically for the main character to chafe at and systems designed specifically to screw them over individually. And honestly, most of the episode's plot, with him going off on a little sidequest to get his DLC super-powerful fighter plane and enough money to sidestep his arranged marriage, felt like little more than a digression. The next one, where he starts attending the academy, will probably feel entirely different.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               As someone who loves games—including JRPGs and dating sims—I greatly enjoyed this first episode. Over the years we've had numerous anime about being reincarnated in good games. The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is the opposite: what it would be like to be trapped in a terrible one.    Let's break down the game we see in this anime. To start with, it suffers from the shotgun approach to game design. Alto Liebe may be a dating sim first and foremost, but it also features both turn-based dungeon crawling and strategy RPG mecha battles. Worse yet, the difficulty for these parts of the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The game is literally designed around its cash shop—forcing players to dump even more real-world money into the game if they want to be able to beat it.    The actual story for the game makes things even worse. When the game was just a game, things didn't really need to make sense. You could have fantasy magic, sci-fi mecha, and a feudal society together in the same story. You could even have an ending where the player character ends up with a harmonious harem made up of the kingdom's finest young men. The problem is that when this becomes a fully-realized world, everything becomes taken to their logical extremes.    This is the world our “hero” (and I use that term loosely) Leon finds himself in. The pay-to-win aspect of the game means that not only are the enemies in the world so strong that he almost dies on his first adventure (despite exploiting the enemies' weaknesses) but also that society is obsessed with money. But far worse is that, to contrive a happy reverse harem ending, the world suffers from a ludicrous level of ingrained misandry—with human men relegated to the status of third-class citizens. Leon himself is set to be married off to a 50-year-old black widow who will send him to the front lines to die for a quick insurance payout.    The world of Trapped in a Dating Sim is a joke—and that's the point. It's cliché and underwritten to the extreme. It's a hell to live in. Because of this, we can get behind Leon and his rather assholish nature. His drive to be as far away from the main plot as possible is understandable—at least in the background he might find something resembling normalcy. Of course, it almost certainly won't be that simple and I look forward to watching Leon bust through numerous dating sim and RPG game tropes as the weeks go on.

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Office worker Leon is reincarnated into a particularly punishing dating sim video game, where women reign supreme and only beautiful men have a seat at the table. But Leon has a secret weapon: he remembers everything from his past life, which includes a complete playthrough of the very game in which he is now trapped. Watch Leon spark a revolution to change this new world in order to fulfill his ultimate desire of living a quiet, easy life in the countryside.    Trapped in a Dating Sim: The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs is based on Yomu Mishima's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               This seems to be the season for me to be making statements like this, but I liked this story (tale type?) more when it was Past Life Countess, Present Life Otome Game NPC?!. Both series have a similar premise: someone is reincarnated in the world of an otome game as a random background character and have to do their best to get the kind of life they want. In the case of this show (based on the light novels of the same name), Leon seems to mostly want to overcome the disadvantages of his upbringing, which are apparently being both the son of his father's mistress and being born male. The latter does raise an eyebrow from me, because I can't think of any otome games that I've played that have that sort of world set up; naturally this doesn't mean that they don't exist, but it's the kind of detail that makes me wonder if the writer(s) have a whole lot of familiarity with otome games in the first place.    The show feels most concerned with the apparently bizarre nature of the game world he's been reincarnated into, which has elements of both fantasy and science fiction, but that's another mild red flag, because those two genres absolutely coexist in the otome games Steam Prison and Code:Realize.    Even if that wasn't the case, however, there's negligible time spent discovering what exactly Leon is after in going to the fancy academy from the game. Perhaps he does want to marry well, but the loot that he brings back from his foray to steal the game's goodies before the plot of the game begins would seem to negate that need, and he also doesn't seem interested in making a play for the heroine. In fact, he actively dislikes the characters from the game, as we see in his playthrough before he falls down the stairs and dies, which may be the single most original moment here because he's not being creamed by everyone's favorite motor vehicle. Watching Leon play the game is probably the most entertaining piece of the entire episode as he gets increasingly frustrated with its mechanics and characters, but even that is marred by the fact that he's doing it for his sister so that she doesn't have to. Does YouTube not exist in their world? Because last I checked, that was a good way to get to watch the cutscenes from video games without having to play them yourself.    The plot doesn't have a terrible concept, and goodness knows that isekai (otome game or otherwise) is ripe for parody and deconstruction at this stage. But as with The Executioner and Her Way of Life, I don't find this the most compelling telling of this particular story. Plus I'm very concerned that the story's “women have all the power” set up is going to be used as a way for the hero to frame himself as a perpetual victim, and I'm not a fan of that for any gender. This just is kind of a muddle, and that's a shame.

REVIEW: Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 1:39 pm            It's a season of Kaguya. The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.           I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

REVIEW: Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 1:39 pm            It's a season of Kaguya. The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.           I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

REVIEW: Kaguya-sama: Love is War -Ultra Romantic-             Note: this is the discussion thread for this article     Anime News Network Forum Index -> Site-related -> Talkback    View previous topic :: View next topic     Author Message        MFrontier    Joined: 13 Apr 2014 		    Posts: 3963       Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 1:39 pm            It's a season of Kaguya. The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

I think the fact that Shirogane isn't from an elite family is why his advice of ""just be yourself"" is a good one. The pressure and expectation from elite family are irrelevant. I suppose if Hayasake was a massive idiot/failure, that had no hope of getting far in life without her family backing/connection, it would be a bad advice, but that's not the case. She has nothing to lose by being herself.

It is just that having an elite family significantly increases your chances of getting disowned or shunned.

And woe betide anyone who thinks they can get away with cheating on her.   The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

The definition of what constitutes cheating and Iino getting berated for trying to defend the boyfriend and needing her ikemen emotional support was everything. And then when the tables turn on Kaguya when she tries to defend the karaoke thing was perfect.    Although you gotta love how she was so sure he was cheating on her and a simple gift was enough to spur on a passionate makeout session. With tongue!    Maki finally makes her proper debut! The girl whose suffering running gag finally culminates in her giving her whole spiel to Shirogane and Ishigami. She's (distantly) related to Kaguya and has the haughtiness and tsundere antics to match. But deep down she's just a girl in love who is in pain seeing the boy she likes with another woman. And Shirogane realizes this is partially his fault as he gets roped into it.   Of course Fujiwara would turn a question about group dates into a new game for the student council to play...where Ishigami and Iino find self-affirmation and Kaguya and Shirogane do a classic Shirogane and Kaguya power play. But at the end of the day, what's important is that Kaguya believes in Shirogane.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it. Shirogane has far less to lose by ""being himself"" than a lot of the kids at the school - he doesn't have the pressures and expectations that come with being from an elite family to deal with and he has already earned acceptance and a full ride to any university that he wants - and yet he still can't do it. Shirogane isn't a bad person, but this sort of thing is why - for example - he can't even get along with a little sister that absolutely adores him.

The staff know what they're doing, they know how to adapt and accentuate the material, and the VA's are still bringing their best. Which is to say it's great to have it back and it's as enjoyable as ever.   I also love how the ED is basically a sequel and genre shift from the season 1 ED, with a parallel ending scene.

Unfortunately, Ishigami - being a typical high school boy - merely wants a girlfriend and isn't that set on who it is. This certainly includes Iino but is by no means limited to her. Iino wants Ishigami to make the first move but that won't happen: as Ishigami isn't devoted to any one girl there is no reason for him to take a shot at a girl that (he thinks) hates him. The problem is that there is no ""good way"" for Iino to convince Ishigami that she doesn't hate him that doesn't involve making the first move. This at least in part because her aversion to his flaws are legitimate and shared in varying degrees by everyone else who knows him.    As for Hayasaka and Shirogane, she definitely won that interaction. Though it was well-intentioned and lacked malice, Shirogane's ""just be yourself"" advice was stunningly bad: it  isn't an option for a lot of people and by having spent 2 years at that high school he should know this. So her ""sure, but only if you go first"" retort was perfect for exposing his high horse and knocking him off it.

The song will debut in the show with the 75th episode on April 30. The new theme song will mark the show's entry into its seventh cours (quarter of a year).    The anime premiered in October 2020. Crunchyroll and Hulu are streaming the anime as it airs. The show went on hiatus after the Toei Animation hack in early March, and aired its first new episode in six weeks on April 16.    Kazuya Karasawa (Dragon Ball Super episode director, Dragon Ball Super: Broly storyboards) is serving as series director at Toei Animation. Katsuhiko Chiba (Rune Soldier, Baby Steps, Tiger Mask W) is supervising the series' scripts. Emiko Miyamoto (Maho Girls Precure!) is designing the characters. Ayaka Fujii (Studio Pablo) is the art director. Yuki Hayashi is composing the music. Aya Mori is in charge of color design. Dragon Quest series director Yuji Horii is credited for supervising the original manga. Toei Animation is producing the anime, which is a hybrid of CG and 2D animation.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

I would be very surprised if they did but after following these things for years I've learned to not expect anything until it actually happens and then you won't be disappointed when nothing happens.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

I would be very surprised if they did but after following these things for years I've learned to not expect anything until it actually happens and then you won't be disappointed when nothing happens.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

That's part of why I'm wondering if they're going to announce an adaption of Codename: Sailor V because it would make sense to have Minako's current seiyuu there if they were going to announce an anime for the story where she's the main character.

We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.

Sailor Moon Eternal was announced at Usagi's birthday so I'm not expecting Stars to be announced till then.  We might get a new musical announcement especially with the composer of the Nogizaka46 musical attending this event.  I'm kind of disappointed none of the rest of the 90s cast and staff besides Kotono were invited for this big retrospective event for the 30th anniversary of the series.  Yet they brought in Sailor Venus' Crystal seiyuu and randomly Shoko Nakagawa.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

Capitol of the Bee Train ""girls with guns on the run"" series of the 00s, Nafrece is now home to the finest sports anime I have seen in years.    Great review. Truly outstanding.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.       Back to top                  SHD    Joined: 05 Apr 2015 		    Posts: 1174       Posted: Thu Apr 21, 2022 5:35 am            I still can't quite get over that we're supposed to just accept that poor orphan illegal squatter, must-hustle-to-eat Eve just kind of decided to go for golf, the ultimate ""very rich person"" sport. I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki   Apr 10th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki ?                     Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better.

That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort. But it really needs to find more than one joke to hang its hat on, because this one gets old quickly.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one?

Community score: 3.6              What is this?   Tsubaki Kunoichi is the best student in her kunoichi school. She lives in a village of women with the rule that they cannot have contact with men. However, she has a curiosity about men that she cannot reveal.    In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is based on Sōichirō Yamamoto's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Boy, Sōichirō Yamamoto's artstyle is not working here. The author of Teasing Master Takagi-san's signature style of cute characters with big noggins and fiveheads may work for realistic slice-of-life romantic comedies, but combined with The Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki's bare-midriff costume designs, it kind of gives things a “sexy baby” vibe. When you add that to the core concept of a teenage girl who's starting to develop an obsession with men despite never having seen one in her life, things get pretty awkward.    I'm willing to buy that despite appearances, Tsubaki and her florally named cohorts are of an age where developing an interest in boys is normal and natural and, with that in mind, the series does have some charm. It gives things kind of a dueling summer camps vibe, where teens are segregated by sex but also desperate to catch a glimpse of one another. Adolescence is a hell of a drug, after all, and while not every girl develops an all-consuming obsession with boys, quite a few of them do at some point or another. Plus, the banter between the girls was pretty cute, whether it be about guys or other topics. The way they kept repeating the same factoids they'd learned from one another for lack of any other kind of information made me chuckle. I half-expected one to bust out, “Boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider” at some point.    It does beg the question: if these girls have literally never seen a man, and all they know is that they're big and smelly and have weak crotches, why would their hormones still go toward them? (Instead of being sublimated to more immediately available and familiar targets, if you catch my drift) It's one thing when you're around boys, but mostly spend time with other girls, and suddenly you start wanting to know about this mysterious other sex; it's another thing when they're basically cryptids.    One last thing in Kunoichi Tsubaki's defense: the show uses the word “otoko,” which is closer in meaning to “male” than to “man” or “men.” The choice to use “men” for the translation instead of “boys” makes it seem like these young girls are lusting after adult men, rather than their peers. With that in mind, things get a lot less creepy. Still a little weird, but not nearly as actively uncomfortable.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Look. I understand what this show is trying to do. The joke is that we have a girl going through puberty who is basically “boy crazy.” Yet, she's surrounded by nothing but girls and has been taught from birth that men are basically monsters (but, importantly, ones that can be defeated with a well-aimed shot to the crotch). She has no one to talk to about her burgeoning sexuality and is trying to keep all these newfound feelings inside—though they keep bursting to the surface whenever she so much as thinks of something even tangentially related to men.    Unfortunately, I am unable to suspend disbelief when it comes to the core concept of the show. If you've never seen a man, think that they are disgusting, inhuman beings, and know nothing about sex and men's role in it, why would you be sexually aroused by them? I mean, she can't even form a mental picture of a man because all she knows about men comes from what her teacher has told them to scare them.    It would be one thing if she were captivated by the unknown—enticed by the taboo nature of meeting a man. After all, most teens rebel at some point and do things they are not supposed to do for the rush of it. But that's not what we are seeing with Tsubaki. She's basically sexually attracted to the concept of men—and an incredibly unflattering concept at that. I think she's going to be disappointed when she finds out that men are actually a lot like women—only with more hair and muscles.    Now, I may be overthinking things (but in my own defense, that's literally what I am paid to do). However, that doesn't change the fact that every time Tsubaki goes to mush thinking about men, I find it annoying instead of cute and silly, and her teammates (one “aggressively lesbian” and the other a lazy glutton) didn't add much to the story beyond being walking plot devices. In the end, this anime is basically a non-starter. Consider me thoroughly not entertained.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This is a bit of a weird one. If you couldn't tell from the size of these characters' foreheads, this is from the same mangaka as Teasing Master Takagi-san, and while it features a similar style of soft and silly humor based around the awkward pangs of early puberty, instead of a typical high-school romcom we get this whole apparatus of a girls-only ninja-in-training village and multiple teams of anime girls throwing shuriken and using ninjutsu. It's a way more complex setting for a similar effect, but it does add a bit of flavor to the whole thing.    It helps that the show just looks really nice. I don't know what magic Sōichirō Yamamoto worked to get two different gorgeously directed adaptations of his work, but that panache helps what might otherwise be pretty standard anime ninja shenanigans feel genuinely fun. These characters move with a ton of energy and spark, the short action sequences are solid, but the real treat is the wonderful environmental work during Tsubaki's nighttime excursion into the woods. The daytime scenes are a bit more pedestrian, but still do well to give this big ol' gaggle of kunoichi the energy you'd expect from kids, even ones training to be ninja. The character designs – specifically the cast's clothing, or lack thereof – are a bit of a red flag, but as of this episode the direction hasn't dipped into anything sexualizing. The closest it gets is Tsubaki blushing over the thought of seeing a b-b-b-boy, but you'd have to stretch pretty far to call that cheesecake.    As for the setup itself, it does feel a bit too contrived at the start, but by the end of the episode we wind up in the same sort of place as like, kids' summer camp movies. You know, it's a sleep-away camp out in the woods, and there's all-girls and all-boys camps on either side of a big lake. They get into adventures trying to sneak over to see the other camp, and eventually there's a big competition at the End of Summer. I don't imagine these competing(?) ninja schools will have a river raft race or a competitive pie eating contest, but you never know. It all mostly winds up as fodder for jokes about kids who don't know anything about boys spreading rumors and theories, including one girl who very clearly heard about dudes getting kicked in the balls and spends the entire rest of the episode telling all her friends about it to seem cool. Tsubaki herself is flustered to hell and back thinking about boys, and that's about all the jokes you get across this premiere.    It's not bad, but it definitely starts wearing thin by the time credits roll, and the sooner the show can introduce more material to build its gags around, the better. This creator has shown before that he can make charming low-key ensemble comedies, and there's certainly enough characters to facilitate that. It just needs to either introduce a stronger comedic hook, or delve more into its setting to get there.       James Beckett  Rating:               Man, I wanted to like In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki, since I'm already such a big fan of author Soichiro Yamamoto's other series, Teasing Master Takagi-san. However, I was definitely not inspired to get my hopes up when I saw the key art and trailers for this new series, which made it look like it was the kind of pandering and fanservice-driven comedy that I'm usually not too keen on. And look, let's get it out of the way up front: If you get skeeved out when a show puts a whole heck of a lot of the camera's focus on the exposed bellies and feet of young girls, thenIn the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki isn't going to be for you. The show is never so crass as to straight-up crash zoom on any of the characters' crotches or anything, but you'd have to be blind to not notice how much effort this series has gone towards putting a literal village full of tween girls into the most revealing ninja outfits that it can manage without knocking itself into an Adults Only timeslot (or a government watch-list, for that matter).    Even if you were to ignore the questionable designs and costume choices of the entire cast, not to mention all of the shots that are specifically designed to highlight the girls' toes and bellybuttons, the biggest issue with In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki would remain: It just isn't very funny. The whole show revolves around precisely one joke, which is that Tsubaki and her fellow lady ninjas hail from a reclusive clan that has managed to live in complete isolation from any men for years, to the point that all of the children treat the very concept of a “man” as some sort of hilarious cryptozoological prank. This is a trope that has been played both straight and as comedic fodder for literally a hundred years or more, from the pages of the sleaziest pulp magazine stories to the hackiest TV sitcoms. It isn't an inherently awful trope, mind you, but it's been played out to the degree that you have to get really creative with it if you want to be successful.    In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki is not really creative about anything it does, and if it weren't for the admittedly slick and entertaining production values, you'd be forgiven for mistaking the series for some bargain bin sex-comedy OVA that's been buried in someone's old VHS stash for the past thirty years. Each of the three main characters has exactly one character trait apiece, and none of them make for great comedy: Tsubaki is the all-star ninja who has become so obsessed with the idea of meeting a guy that she can't do her job anymore, Sazanka is the obsessive scamp who can't keep her hands/feet/body off of Tsubaki, and Asagao is…I guess she's the dumb one? I don't know. The show is too busy making lazy double entendre puns and repeating the same joke about Tsubaki's overflowing horniness to bother communicating anything else to its audience.    That's the thing about this preview: It could very well be that there is a genuinely funny and endearing comedy hiding somewhere underneath all of the lazy writing and questionable artistic decisions, but if that version of In the Heart Kunoichi Tsubaki does exist, this first episode certainly didn't do a great job of advertising it. I'll stick to Takagi-san, thank you very much. Consider this one of the season's biggest disappointments.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               It's entirely possible that In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki is trying to be a sort of light riff on that period of adolescence when some people become obsessed with whatever gender(s) they're attracted to. In fact, I highly suspect that's the case – in a world where ninja schools are segregated by gender, the guiding principle of the girls' school seems to be that men are like ticks – something best avoided and, in this case, often found outside. But because people are people, the harping on how awful men are has had the effect that the girls are all fully obsessed with them, something that ranges from “deliciously grossed out” to “fluttery feelings in the chest.” While most of the girls fall into the first category, our eponymous heroine is firmly in the second, but because her teacher is so down on men, she thinks that liking them must mean that there's something wrong with her. Hijinks ensue.    I'm not sure what point exactly this episode is trying to make or what mood it's hoping to strike. We have a yuri-bait character in Sazanka, who is more attached to Tsubaki than she perhaps should be, we have plenty of cute girl designs and young women in various states of undress (or rather, clothing that doesn't cover much), and we have Tsubaki who is plainly attracted to men despite having never seen one. Presumably it's all meant to be funny, but it doesn't quite manage it, in part because even when the story hits on something amusing, it's promptly used as many times as possible in the moments following its introduction. Even if you've never seen a man you can surely use your imagination to come up with more than the oft-repeated “smelly, doesn't bathe, big bodies but weak in the crotch” that's practically the theme song of this episode. There are more ways to describe the Loch Ness Monster, for goodness' sake. It feels like someone thought the concept (and that repeated statement) is a lot funnier than it actually is.    On the other hand, this is a different approach to the CGCT genre, so if you're interested in a variation on that theme, this may be worth checking out. Bobble-head look of the character designs aside, it doesn't look awful, and if the attempt to show how far the girls can jump ends up looking more like they're flying on invisible brooms, well, I at least appreciate the effort.
