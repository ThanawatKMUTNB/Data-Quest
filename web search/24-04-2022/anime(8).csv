Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.2           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.2           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.2           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Skeleton Knight in Another World Episode 3  by Richard Eisenbeis, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of Skeleton Knight in Another World ?                     Community score: 4.2           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.    Rating:                Random Thoughts   •	So Arc just basically reenacted the final scene of Rogue One on those unarmed bandits. He clearly has zero qualms about killing “bad” people (which has some potentially troubling implications).    •	Ponta was totally down for all that bandit mass murder.    •	I'm unsure whether Arc killed the sadistic noble heir or not. If he did, he's just made a powerful enemy—though Arc looks to be on his way to taking him down anyway just by helping Ariane.    •	While the show clearly doesn't have an insane budget, I like the way they are mixing the CG and 2D animation for the best effect—i.e., 2D for the close ups, CG for the wide shots.    •	More fantasy adventures should have power metal openings. Or better yet, Viking metal openings.    •	I also love how the opening is a mini-adventure and contains both sound effects and voice acting.

Community score: 4.2           Now that we're three episodes in it's safe to say we've established the status quo and here it is: as far as fantasy worlds go, this one objectively sucks to live in. Bandits rape and pillage with near impunity while nobles enslave women and release monsters upon the commoners for their own meager political gains. Rather than a high fantasy world, this one seems much closer to a dark fantasy world—though its clear that Arc is ignorant of this fact. He still sees himself as an RPG protagonist so it makes sense that he runs into conflict everywhere he looks. It doesn't occur to him that the amount of bad stuff he has encountered is the norm for people in this world rather than the exception—which brings us to Ariane.    Ariane is well aware of the nature of her world—and as an elf (specifically a dark elf), she is more privy to its crapsack side than most. While her people are supposedly at peace with the humans, it doesn't stop bandits from kidnapping and enslaving pretty much every elf they come across. As one of the warriors of her kind, it is her job to protect her people—which is something of a loosing battle at this point. It's no surprise that she's jaded and believes all humans are inherently evil liars given her experiences. Arc has got to be the strangest person she has ever met—and not just because of his breadth of powerful magic and skills.    In a world where those with power selfishly abuse it, Arc is the rare individual who uses his for good. What's more is that he does good not for any kind of reward or prestige (aside from the meager funds he needs for room and board) but literally for the joy of doing good. Arc is an adventurer in the truest sense. He simply wants to go on adventures—righting wrongs and helping the downtrodden in the process. His whole life he has played at being this kind of hero in video games but now it's his chance to do it for real.    This is what gives the show its conflicting tones: Horrible stuff is happening constantly in this world yet Arc is still upbeat about the whole thing. The show even acknowledges this through Ariane's reactions to Arc—she is thrown off balance by the way he acts. Yet, these conflicting tones are not a bad thing. While Arc's disconnection from the reality he faces can cause problems, it can also be a source for inspiration. His selfless actions in helping the elven children clearly change Ariane's views on humans enough for her to ask him for his help. And in a more meta sense, it gives the show both some levity to offset its often dark subject matter and provide some good setups for fish-out-of-water humor.    In the most general sense, Arc is an unshakable optimist in a pessimistic world. What's more, his optimism is infectious—spreading to those he befriends. He may not be saving the world in the traditional sense (at least, not yet) but he is saving little pieces of it, making life better for the poor and oppressed he encounters.

The cast lineup actually was good as many popular characters got added in the first year. But it's a mixed blessing to see your tantou idol in the game with no sure way to get them from the gacha (maybe other than resemara). The puzzle game aspect was fine, but it also didn't have much in terms of original content, which probably is the real cause of death.

The cast lineup actually was good as many popular characters got added in the first year. But it's a mixed blessing to see your tantou idol in the game with no sure way to get them from the gacha (maybe other than resemara). The puzzle game aspect was fine, but it also didn't have much in terms of original content, which probably is the real cause of death.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
24-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name.

I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
24-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it.

24-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"             How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 3.0              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

24-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/spy-family/episodes-1-2/.184756,Episodes 1-2 - Spy×Family - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind.
