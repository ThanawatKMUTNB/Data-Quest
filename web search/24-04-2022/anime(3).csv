Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task Episodes 1-3  by Steve Jones, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0                  How would you rate episode 3 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.3           Ah, idols. The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.

The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

The sights. The sounds. The surly teen boy stars who need to be reined in by their classmate and secret part-time manager-in-training. It's a wild world out there amongst the fickle peaks and valleys of showbiz, and Heroines Run the Show is here to put its own spin on the music industry by exemplifying the fortitude that can be found beneath a pair of bushy eyebrows.    This series is charming right out the gate. In fact, if I wanted you to leave this review with a singular impression of the anime, I'd wrap it up in the word “charming.” The colors are bright, the construction is solid, the comedy is breezy, and the characters, most importantly, are bursting with definition and appeal. Our heroine Hiyori in particular carries the premiere on her shoulders. As a mousey girl from the countryside who matriculates to Tokyo to pursue her track-and-field passions, she can be both a highly relatable bundle of nerves and a headstrong outsider unafraid to go against the grain. While that's hardly a novel combination, it's a magnetic one in her case, strengthened by Inori Minase's performance and Kaori Ishii's distinctive character designs (you may recognize them from the similarly quirky O Maidens in Your Savage Season). More specifically, it's the power of those eyebrows. I'm not kidding in the slightest. This anime would be a full letter grade worse if Hiyori had naught but thin pencil lines stenciled on her forehead. Thick eyebrows are always the correct choice.    The show's conceit is offbeat in an enjoyable way as well. Like many idol anime, it explores the inevitable divide that grows between a celebrity's public and private personae, but Heroines turns that into its main focus. The boys behind the giggle-inducing name LIPxLIP have their share of issues with both themselves and each other. In fact, we meet Yujiro fresh out of police custody before we even find out he's an idol. He and Aizo constantly bicker with each other, and they each seem miserable anytime they're off camera and out of their fans' sight. Again, I can't say this is breaking new ground, but it feels pleasantly salacious to watch these two teen dreamboats at each other's throats behind the scenes. It both humanizes them and enhances the humor. Anger, after all, is the essence of comedy.    Despite this mutual hatred, Yujiro and Aizo are determined to remain in their idol outfit, and both have communicated vague reasons for why they refuse to quit. Presumably, later episodes will explore their motivations in greater detail, which should help round out their characters; for now, they're not much more than two-faced jerks. However, I like jerks. There's a time and place for conflict-free comfort food, but I'm glad this series embraces the melodrama. To that point, they also contrast Hiyori's innocent do-gooder attitude in a complementary way. While Heroines is far from cynical, and it's not like the boys drag Hiyori down to their level, they do draw some fire out of her small frame, which benefits the show overall. And on the opposite side of the coin, she's started softening the lads' demeanor as well. It's adorable.    Keeping in line with the theme of secret faces, Hiyori also has to keep her job a secret from everyone else. The whole situation beggars belief—especially her homeroom teacher's laissez-faire attitude towards everything—but it's justified in the service of entertainment. There's inherent comedy in Hiyori, apparently the only girl in Tokyo who hasn't heard of LIPxLIP, becoming their ward for nearly all waking hours of the day. And while she doesn't care about idols, she does care about doing things right. She's as serious about being a good manager as she is serious about track. That said, I do appreciate the show taking time to mention that Hiyori is also raking in the dough for her time with the boys at school. Overtime work isn't sustainable (and we've already seen some nasty consequences of her overstuffed schedule), but speaking from experience, overtime pay definitely helps.    I should also make note of the series' origins. Did you know that it's based on Vocaloid songs? I sure didn't! The composers of the collective HoneyWorks starting writing pieces of this musical multiverse called Kokuhaku Jikkou Iinkai: Ren'ai Series (translated Confession Executive Committee: Love Series) back in 2011, and since then they've spawned full albums, light novels, films, and now this second television anime called Heroines Run the Show. Most of the main players in this show are apparently based on characters from those songs, but you definitely don't need to know any of that to enjoy the anime. I mean, I only learned of it while doing research to write this review, and I already liked these first three episodes plenty, so don't let this additional context intimidate you.    I mostly bring it up because the song series, as described, focuses on romance. The previous TV miniseries based on this franchise, Our love has always been 10 centimeters apart., was a romance too. So far, however, I haven't gotten that vibe from Heroines Run the Show. It's a character-based and shoujo-inspired drama/comedy through and through, but the proverbial doki-dokis haven't entered into the equation. I think that's been to the story's benefit too. Hiyori's combative relationship with the even more combative interactions between Yujiro and Aizo is already a plenty interesting triangle. I'm sure there's a way the show could develop this into a spicy idol polycule, but I'd be perfectly content to watch Heroines focus on strengthening their professional and personal bonds in spite of all this prickliness.    Overall, I'd say Heroines Run the Show passes the three-episode test with aplomb. It has enough musical pedigree (and handsome dudes) to appeal to idol devotees, it's acerbic enough about the industry to draw in skeptics, and its heroine is plucky enough to capture the hearts of most everybody in between. The presentation is confident and appealing, and while this is the first anime helmed by director Noriko Hashimoto, she has a good C.V. (including Sarazanmai and Given episodes) and a strong showing so far. It's a bit of an odd duck, Given its origin and concept, but I think Heroines has the potential to be a low-key crowd-pleaser with its eclectic blend of shoujo vibes and cantankerous idol boys.    Oh, also there's a gal supporting character. People still like gals, right? And the eyebrows. I won't let you forget about the eyebrows.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

Capitol of the Bee Train ""girls with guns on the run"" series of the 00s, Nafrece is now home to the finest sports anime I have seen in years.    Great review. Truly outstanding.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

Shame that there are at least two worthless m*les who are relevant. Serious letdown, reminds me a lot of Two Car. Hopefully those m*les don't get in the way of the Golf Girls' Story and the girls will stand out more. At least this is what the poster should have been.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

Shame that there are at least two worthless m*les who are relevant. Serious letdown, reminds me a lot of Two Car. Hopefully those m*les don't get in the way of the Golf Girls' Story and the girls will stand out more. At least this is what the poster should have been.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.           That's why I want an anime adaptation of Teppuu. It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.           I regret to inform you that Adam Sandler has kept making movies with the same exact attitudes to this day despite whatever culture war nonsense you've decided stopped him.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.

Arguably the most important influence on Birdie Wing is Osamu Dezaki's legendary anime adaptation of Sumika Yamamoto's shoujo tennis manga classic Aim for the Ace!.            Perhaps, though the ""supporting a gaggle of adorable orphans with winnings,"" while a pretty commonplace trope, points to some Tiger Mask influence as well. Tiger Mask has inspired other donations to orphanages to this day. (Ashita no Joe used it as well.)

It also has some absurd crime boss shenanigans which I'm all for, and manages to not push fanservice in your face too aggressively, which is otherwise often a problem with female protagonists in sports animes.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

For me sports anime fall on a scale between Cute (boys/girls) sometimes do sports to Hardcore teaches you about the sport including tactics. this is some where closer to the center but with a 90 degree turn towards crazy. at this point I'm kind of looking forward to this series.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.   Never thought I would be enjoying an anime about girls' golf, but it caught my interest after the buzz it made on the Preview Guide. If more ladies sports anime were like Birdie Wing and less vapid and fanservice-y, I'd watch more of them.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.  And that's coming from someone who really enjoyed Keijo!^8.

I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

It's is pretty much the only even remotely recent girls' sports manga I've seen that is, in fact, about girls doing sports (MMA in this case) and not about girls being cute while also doing some sports. They're not Cute Girls or Hot Sexy Ladies, they're not there to be ogled or cooed over, there's no cutesy shenanigans, just girls doing competitive sports while being actual people with personalities, thoughts and flaws and issues.

Happy Gilmore was a total guy movie - 100% testosterone - of the sort that Hollywood won't go near today. It was also far more negative towards the affluent and privileged than this show is going to be to Aoi. Another thing is that Happy actually hated golf. He wanted to be a pro hockey player. Happy didn't embrace golf until the very end of the movie. Until then he was only interested in saving his grandmother's house and beating his rival - (again, a much less sympathetic figure than this show's Aoi) - and in that order.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there.

It's not that difficult, and also not something to get worked up about. Pretty sure the blond guy with the scars is Eve's parental figure/teacher, so he needs to be there. Not sure about the other guy yet, he's part of the staff at Aoi's golf school (which I'm assuming Eve joins later on), so he will also probably have a prominent role to play.

I'm less enthusiastic about the series, but given that it's about golf, which I despise, the fact that I'm still enjoying this kinda speaks volumes on its behalf.   I was a bit shocked when she entered the under-15 tourney, as I'd been under the impression that she was an adult.  And even then, I'm not sure if ""under-15"" means 14 and under, or 15 and under.  Because I'm having a hard enough time buying that she's 15, let alone 14.  Aoi I could believe is 14 or 15.  Then again, I suppose Eve could just be impersonating a kid.  My point is, I'm not sure what it is I'm supposed to believe about Eve's actual age.   And I wholeheartedly agree with RenRen's last sentence.  I'm generally all-in for any sports anime no matter how stupid, with serious reservations about boxing and gory bash-fests like Baki the Grappler, but women's sports anime usually grind my gears so hard I can't even.

REVIEW: Birdie Wing -Golf Girls' Story- - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA," I still can't quite get over that we're supposed to just accept that poor orphan illegal squatter, must-hustle-to-eat Eve just kind of decided to go for golf, the ultimate ""very rich person"" sport. I mean I guess your calling is your calling, but, er, lol.   Anyway, I can't say I'm enamored with this show, for one I'm not really good with sports anime most of the time, and two, it's one of those series I've been seeing a lot in these past years, that seem like they time-traveled here from the '00s or even '90s. (Many people may embrace this with nostalgia, but for me it's just kind of weirdly tonedeaf/outdated, and I say this as someone who was already watching anime in the '90s.) But it's not bad or anything, so I guess I'll watch a few more episodes to see if it gets any more interesting for me. I do like how it doesn't seem to have that overwhelming ""we have a story and everything, but also GUYS there are hot sexy ladies, ogle them to your heart's content!"" attitude (...so far) that turned me off of so many shows from that era.

News Neofilms Posts Chinese-Subtitled Trailer for Kin-iro Mosaic Anime Film   posted on 2022-04-22 16:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film opens in Hong Kong on April 28    Hong Kong film distributor Neofilms began streaming a Chinese-subtitled trailer on Thursday for Kin-iro Mosaic Thank you!!, the new anime film based on Yui Hara's Kin-iro Mosaic manga. Neofilms will open the film in Hong Kong on April 28.      The film opened in Japan in August 2021.    Munenori Nawa (NAKAIMO - My Little Sister Is Among Them!, R-15) directed the film at Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ, and Yuniko Ayana (Hello!! KINMOZA, Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic) wrote the script. Kazuyuki Ueda (Hello!! KINMOZA, Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic) designed the characters. Voice actress unit Rhodanthe* performed the film's theme song ""Kin-iro Rhodanthe.""    Hara launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Max magazine in April 2010, and the series ended in March 2020. Houbunsha released the 11th compiled book volume in April 2020. A special Kin-iro Mosaic Best wishes manga launched in May 2020, and ended in March 2021.    The original manga's story begins with Shinobu, a 15-year-old, seemingly ""pure Japanese"" girl who did a homestay in Great Britain. Even after coming back to Japan, she still misses her time overseas. One day, an air mail letter arrives from Alice, the girl in Shinobu's host family in Great Britain. The letter reads, ""Shinobu, I'm coming to Japan!"" The ""Japanese/British girls' light comedy"" follows the lives of Shinobu, Alice, and other girls from both Japan and Great Britain.    The first anime series based on the manga aired in 2013, and the second series, Hello!! KINMOZA, premiered in 2015. The Kin-iro Mosaic: Pretty Days anime special episode opened in theaters in Japan in November 2016.

News Neofilms Posts Chinese-Subtitled Trailer for Kin-iro Mosaic Anime Film   posted on 2022-04-22 16:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film opens in Hong Kong on April 28    Hong Kong film distributor Neofilms began streaming a Chinese-subtitled trailer on Thursday for Kin-iro Mosaic Thank you!!, the new anime film based on Yui Hara's Kin-iro Mosaic manga. Neofilms will open the film in Hong Kong on April 28.      The film opened in Japan in August 2021.    Munenori Nawa (NAKAIMO - My Little Sister Is Among Them!, R-15) directed the film at Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ, and Yuniko Ayana (Hello!! KINMOZA, Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic) wrote the script. Kazuyuki Ueda (Hello!! KINMOZA, Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic) designed the characters. Voice actress unit Rhodanthe* performed the film's theme song ""Kin-iro Rhodanthe.""    Hara launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Max magazine in April 2010, and the series ended in March 2020. Houbunsha released the 11th compiled book volume in April 2020. A special Kin-iro Mosaic Best wishes manga launched in May 2020, and ended in March 2021.    The original manga's story begins with Shinobu, a 15-year-old, seemingly ""pure Japanese"" girl who did a homestay in Great Britain. Even after coming back to Japan, she still misses her time overseas. One day, an air mail letter arrives from Alice, the girl in Shinobu's host family in Great Britain. The letter reads, ""Shinobu, I'm coming to Japan!"" The ""Japanese/British girls' light comedy"" follows the lives of Shinobu, Alice, and other girls from both Japan and Great Britain.    The first anime series based on the manga aired in 2013, and the second series, Hello!! KINMOZA, premiered in 2015. The Kin-iro Mosaic: Pretty Days anime special episode opened in theaters in Japan in November 2016.

News Neofilms Posts Chinese-Subtitled Trailer for Kin-iro Mosaic Anime Film   posted on 2022-04-22 16:30 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film opens in Hong Kong on April 28    Hong Kong film distributor Neofilms began streaming a Chinese-subtitled trailer on Thursday for Kin-iro Mosaic Thank you!!, the new anime film based on Yui Hara's Kin-iro Mosaic manga. Neofilms will open the film in Hong Kong on April 28.      The film opened in Japan in August 2021.    Munenori Nawa (NAKAIMO - My Little Sister Is Among Them!, R-15) directed the film at Studio Gokumi and AXsiZ, and Yuniko Ayana (Hello!! KINMOZA, Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic) wrote the script. Kazuyuki Ueda (Hello!! KINMOZA, Kinmoza! Kiniro + Mosaic) designed the characters. Voice actress unit Rhodanthe* performed the film's theme song ""Kin-iro Rhodanthe.""    Hara launched the manga in Houbunsha's Manga Time Kirara Max magazine in April 2010, and the series ended in March 2020. Houbunsha released the 11th compiled book volume in April 2020. A special Kin-iro Mosaic Best wishes manga launched in May 2020, and ended in March 2021.    The original manga's story begins with Shinobu, a 15-year-old, seemingly ""pure Japanese"" girl who did a homestay in Great Britain. Even after coming back to Japan, she still misses her time overseas. One day, an air mail letter arrives from Alice, the girl in Shinobu's host family in Great Britain. The letter reads, ""Shinobu, I'm coming to Japan!"" The ""Japanese/British girls' light comedy"" follows the lives of Shinobu, Alice, and other girls from both Japan and Great Britain.    The first anime series based on the manga aired in 2013, and the second series, Hello!! KINMOZA, premiered in 2015. The Kin-iro Mosaic: Pretty Days anime special episode opened in theaters in Japan in November 2016.

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    game review          19 comments       Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition   Apr 14, 00:00 19 comments                 games    Chrono Cross returns with a remastered treatment and its never-before-translated predecessor, Radical Dreamers! How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied wi...                           game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end. What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. It perfectly captures a certain branch of gamer culture in its dialogue, visual styles, and gameplay, making for a unique experience that absolutely should not be missed.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

It's a modern-day port of an older Shin Megami Tensei game that was still experimenting with 3D movement and presentation (those have mostly stuck to the Persona games while later SMTs went back to ...                    game review          4 comments       Resident Evil Village   May 19, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It has been three years since the events of the last game and our favorite, perfectly normal everyman Ethan Winters is trying to live a normal life with his wife and newly born daughter Rose.

Th...                    game review                Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate   2018 Aug 28, 22:14                 games    This content-rich but intimidating adventure from the 3DS has landed on the Nintendo Switch. Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action! Which of these two new games should you play? Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level. That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up? Dave Riley finds out. ― With the release of a new console, the Switch, comes the expected glut of HD ports, and Resident Evil Revelations, which has been ported to on average a console and a half per year since its original release on the 3DS in 2012, is...                    game review          10 comments       Etrian Odyssey V: Beyond the Myth   2017 Oct 21, 22:00 10 comments                 games    Does the newest entry in this difficult RPG series still hurt good enough to be worth the challenge? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    game review          19 comments       Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition   Apr 14, 00:00 19 comments                 games    Chrono Cross returns with a remastered treatment and its never-before-translated predecessor, Radical Dreamers! How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied wi...                           game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end. What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat.

Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago.

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    game review          19 comments       Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition   Apr 14, 00:00 19 comments                 games    Chrono Cross returns with a remastered treatment and its never-before-translated predecessor, Radical Dreamers! How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied wi...                           game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end. What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. The game acts as an accelerat...                    game review          2 comments       Mary Skelter Finale   Oct 13, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Mary Skelter Finale's twistedly imaginative imagery are sure to sit with any player long after they've put it down. ― Of all the JRPG/visual novel hybrids I've had a chance to play, Mary Skelter Finale is by far the most memorable of the considerably homogenous bunch. Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. It perfectly captures a certain branch of gamer culture in its dialogue, visual styles, and gameplay, making for a unique experience that absolutely should not be missed. The games feature a brash comedic style, absurdly degenerate action,...                    game review          10 comments       Everyday♪ Today's MENU for EMIYA Family   Jun 13, 00:00 10 comments                 games    With its sparse content, performance issues, and tepid dialogue, Everyday♪ Today's Menu for Emiya Family is a bad game even by the standards of low-budget anime tie-ins. ― With its sparse content, performance issues, and tepid dialogue, Everyday♪ Today's MENU for EMIYA Family is a bad game even by the standards of low-budget anime tie-ins.

The one that has everything we could possibly want (okay, except for Waluigi)....                    game review          26 comments       Pokémon: Let's Go!   2018 Nov 21, 02:15 26 comments                 games    Pokémon fans can explore the Kanto region like never before in this high-def remake of the classic Yellow Version, but has Generation 1 aged gracefully? Branden Johnson finds out. ― I missed the Pokemon train entirely the first time around. It's strange; I love JRPGs, and I was the perfect age when Pokemon Red and Blue hit the Gameboy in the 90s. Whatever the reasons, I haven't played a single Pokemo...                    game review          2 comments       SNK 40th Anniversary Collection   2018 Nov 16, 02:22 2 comments                 games    SNK delivers a history lesson with an anthology of early arcade and NES titles. Todd finds out how well these games have held up in this new game for the Switch. ― What made SNK a cult favorite game company? Was it the Neo Geo, which delivered arcade-perfect games at home for just two hundred dollars per cartridge? Was it the Neo Geo Pocket Color, a well-made and vastly underappreciated handheld syst...                    game review          7 comments       My Hero: One's Justice (PlayStation 4)   2018 Oct 24, 23:43 7 comments                 games    My Hero One’s Justice captures the essence of its source material, and offers a fine experience for anyone looking to cross blows as their My Hero Academia favorites. ― The anime franchise tie-in brawler is a venerable gaming institution, with Bandai Namco having published similar efforts for franchises like Naruto and Dragon Ball in the past. On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together? Daryl Surat scours the wasteland to find out. ― The last few years have marked a surge in popularity among English-language fans of both Sega's long-running Yakuza series of videogames as well as—to a lesser extent—the formative trope-establishing Sh...                    game review          7 comments       Mega Man 11   2018 Oct  2, 23:36 7 comments                 anime    It's Mega Man's big chance for a comeback, and it's not what some fans might expect. We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter. It's a real “gamer” series: brutal difficulty, complex systems, a strong community. Being a fan of Dark Souls and Bloodborne, I figured I would get into Monster Hunter, if I could...                    game review          9 comments       Review: Fate/Grand Order Arcade   2018 Aug 22, 01:14 9 comments                 games    The smash hit Fate smartphone game gets an extra-fancy new arcade edition in Japan that actually prints out physical cards for you to take home - but it doesn't come cheap! Richard Eisenbeis took the plunge, here's his report. ―  The Fate franchise is massive and sprawling. There are numerous games, TV anime, movies, novels, drama CDs, and manga. But while the franchise originally became popular duri...                    game review          2 comments       Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night & Persona 5: Dancing Star Night   2018 Aug  8, 22:00 2 comments                 games    In the wake of Persona 4's successful rhythm game, its siblings are getting in on the action!

Richard Eisenbeis has the answers in our full review. ― Following in the footsteps of 2015's Persona 4: Dancing All Night, Persona 3: Dancing Moon Night and Persona 5: Dancing Star Night are a pair of rhythm/music games that showcase the awesome soundtracks of Pe...                    game review          19 comments       Valkyria Chronicles 4   2018 Aug  6, 22:00 19 comments                 anime    Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, Valkyria Chronicles 4 doesn't disappoint. Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own. However, instead of coal or oil, it is the mysterious mineral ragnite—which can do anything from cure wounds to power a ...                    game review          2 comments       Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido   2018 Jul 22, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This quirky puzzle game for the Nintendo Switch and 3DS is sure to win over fans of absurd humor and fast-paced strategy. Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time.

That it's crafted with loving reverence to one of the most popular anime on the planet is ...                    game review          4 comments       River City: Rival Showdown   2017 Dec 20, 23:03 4 comments                 games    The open-world gameplay of this breezy beat-em-up returns on the Nintendo 3DS. Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    game review          19 comments       Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition   Apr 14, 00:00 19 comments                 games    Chrono Cross returns with a remastered treatment and its never-before-translated predecessor, Radical Dreamers! How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied wi...                           game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end. What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you.

Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online.

An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...

How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger.

It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine.

A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release.

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    game review          19 comments       Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition   Apr 14, 00:00 19 comments                 games    Chrono Cross returns with a remastered treatment and its never-before-translated predecessor, Radical Dreamers! How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger. It is, of course, but Chrono Trigger—an inventive, marvelously crafted time-travel romp that's tied wi...                           game review          19 comments       Rune Factory 5   Mar 22, 18:00 19 comments                 games    Some technical issues aside, the latest installment in the village-making RPG brings it all together in the end. What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk. It's sharper, tighter, more enjoyable...and now competing directly with the latest Mario Kart on Nintendo's home turf. ― The original Chocobo Racing was not an astounding game, but it was a cleverly-positioned one. It offered the PlayStation owners of 1999 an answer to the Nintendo 64's Mario Kart while dusting itself with Final Fantasy refere...                    game review          8 comments       Persona 4 Arena Ultimax Review   Mar 11, 01:21 8 comments                 games    Now that Persona 4 Arena Ultimax is out on modern platforms with a massive adoption rate, the question is how much is in here for a single-playing Persona? The answer is an inspiring ""Quite a bit!"" ― The rerelease of 2014's Persona 4 Arena Ultimax finds itself in an odd situation for such a thing. The fighting game scene has ballooned into an even bigger, better place in the eight years since, so put...                    game review          1 comment       Jujutsu Kaisen: Escape From the Cursed Spirit of the Abandoned School   Feb 26, 01:00 1 comment                 games    Gojo assigns you to a mission to help the first-year students investigate a creepy abandoned school. Can you and the others use your techniques -- and your smarts -- to exorcise the cursed spirit before it's too late? ― When you think of an anime world you would want to live in, Jujutsu Kaisen probably isn't at the top of your list, if it is even on the list. But it's possible you've dreamed of going...                    game review          1 comment       Atelier Sophie 2: Alchemist of the Mysterious Dream   Feb 24, 22:00 1 comment                 games    The Nintendo Switch struggles to handle this new entry in the Atelier franchise, but beyond its technical issues the world of Erde Wiege introduces players to characters that quickly come to feel like longtime friends. ― There are three things I've come to expect from the Atelier series: cozy atmosphere, charming character writing, and breezy combat. The series is content to dwell within that realm, ...                    game review          6 comments       The King of Fighters XV   Feb 24, 01:00 6 comments                 games    The King of Fighters XV doesn't find the series at its prettiest, boldest, or most densely populated and varied in characters. Yet this might be the most accessible it's ever been. ― If anyone ever asks you how many The King of Fighters games there are, resist the temptation to say fifteen. That may be the number on this latest flagship entry, but this is a vast and complicated series with many, many...                    game review          25 comments       REVIEW: Pokémon Legends: Arceus   Feb 20, 01:00 25 comments                 games    While the plot left much to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings new energy and possibilities to the franchise. ― For years, it seems the big ask of Pokémon fans has been that the franchise innovate itself in a meaningful way. Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for. It ...                    game review          21 comments       Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl   Jan 18, 01:20 21 comments                 games    As a fan, it pains me to see an entry to one of my favorite franchises fall to such low lows. But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario. Westone, creators of the Wonder Boy and Monster World games, tested this colorful side-scroller in arcades several times back in 199...                    game review          3 comments       Metallic Child   Dec 14, 01:00 3 comments                 games    Metallic Child's narrative is instantly compelling and the dialogue that accompanies its characters is entertaining to boot. ― I initially wasn't expecting much from this quietly released indie “rouge-lite” game, but found myself sad to see it go by the time I reached its ending. The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine. One guy is exclusively interested in meeting women who are already ""taken."" Another literally c...                    game review          7 comments       Danganronpa Decadence   Nov 30, 02:00 7 comments                 games    Danganronpa Decadence offers a bit of new content, gameplay, and interactions between cast members, but this little something extra hardly feels decadent. ― Over ten years ago, the first Danganronpa game came out on the PlayStation Portable. Even back then, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc was a standout of the visual novel genre, combining detective work and dating sim elements in a way that weirdly...                    game review          16 comments       Shin Megami Tensei V   Nov  5, 01:00 16 comments                 games    While SMT fans have no doubt chomped at the bit in anticipation of a new numbered entry arriving on consoles, some might still want to cling to the memory of Nocturne. Is this new, untested Shin Megami Tensei worth the plunge? ― Shin Megami Tensei V has one glaring problem it has to contend with: Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne HD Remaster was released just this past May. While SMT fans have no doub...                    game review          11 comments       Metroid Dread   Oct 28, 00:00 11 comments                 games    The gameplay of Dread is similarly spectacular. A lot of the DNA from Samus Returns – Mercury Steam's first Metroid project – is present here, albeit with the fat shaved off the bones. ― Before diving into the meat of this review, I feel it's important to mention that it is coming from a newcomer to the series, and that I ran some short stints into Metroid: Zero Mission and Fusion in order to lend so...                    game review          2 comments       Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles   Oct 14, 00:04 2 comments                 games    Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time. ― Being one of the most acclaimed anime of the past few years partially due to its stellar animation and fight scenes, a Demon Slayer fighting game felt like it was only a matter of time.

Its aesthetically varied character designs, lewd but narratively significant fanservice (think Darling in the Franxx), and twistedly i...                    game review          3 comments       Samurai Warriors 5   Aug 12, 03:00 3 comments                 games    The most creatively bankrupt aspect of Samurai Warriors 5 is by and large its combat. ― While I've called Dynasty Warrior's gameplay recipe outdated before, the franchise has gone out of its way to prove me wrong recently, with games like Age of Calamity and Persona 5 Strikers exceeding my expectations. These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club. It seems the club is suffering from a lack of member...                    game review          10 comments       Fuga: Melodies of Steel   Aug  4, 00:00 10 comments                 games    It's a challenge to take on a brutal World War II retelling with imagery and characters cute enough to populate Maple Town, but CyberConnect2 sticks with it, and it's paid off. ― Cyberconnect2 is best known as the developer of gorgeous anime-to-game adaptations stretching from Naruto and .hack to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. In their heart of hearts, however, company president/CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama and ...                    game review          4 comments       NEO: The World Ends With You   Jul 27, 01:00 4 comments                 games    Well, it took fourteen years, but NEO: The World Ends with You is finally here, and it's every bit as stylish, engrossing, and outright fun as its predecessor. ― When the original The World Ends with You launched all the way back in 2007 on the Nintendo DS, it won attention and praise for its unorthodox storytelling and gameplay. It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game. It's a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just s...                    game review                MARS RED Edge of the Nightmare   Jul 13, 00:00                 games    If you enjoyed the show, the story acts as a nice companion to the events of the anime, and several familiar characters from the Code Zero crew like Takeuchi, Suwa, and Kurusu all play key roles. ― Whenever a major new anime hits the scene, there's a mobile game to accompany it, like clockwork. Many of these games remain Japanese exclusives, with only a handful releasing globally. Additionally, many ...                    game review          9 comments       Death end re;Quest   Jul  6, 03:00 9 comments                 games    Death end proves me dead wrong: it demonstrates not only Idea Factory's ability to put out quality titles, but that they can also be trusted to take real creative risks and create unique games – something all too rare in today's market. ― I wasn't expecting much from Death end re;Quest when I first picked it up. It's a product of Compile Heart, which is itself a subsidiary of Idea Factory – a studio ...                    game review          5 comments       No More Heroes 1 & 2   Jun 30, 00:00 5 comments                 games    The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games. ― The No More Heroes franchise is first and foremost a celebration of video games.

Grant Jones revisits the franchise to see if the games still hold up to their legacy. ― The Ninja Gaiden Master Collection is hard to talk about in isolation. In many ways, you need a dramatic, long-winded cut scene to get the context for the release. So if you'll indulge me, I'll try to spin the tale as bes...                    game review          15 comments       Capcom Arcade Stadium   Jun  7, 00:00 15 comments                 games    Video game archives and collections of this nature are all about making sure these newer generations of gamers get a chance to experience those which laid the groundwork for the stuff that we have today in an easy-to-digest package. ― Judging collections like this is always a bit tricky because we're not reviewing a brand new game made specifically for the current generation; rather, we're technicall...                    game review          1 comment       Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection   Jun  5, 00:00 1 comment                 games    Both stories have some arbitrary info blocks like this, but even with my sus sense tingling, neither case went exactly where I expected it to go. ― This visual novel double-pack was released for English-speaking audiences for the first time on May 14, offering a shiny remake of Satoru Okada and Yoshio Sakamoto's adventure games for Nintendo.

If you've played many of the Yakuza titles and are interested in seeing how it all comes together, I can't recommend this game enough. ― Most Japanese RPGs are wildly fantastical and cartoonish in their setting, but attempt to stay grounded through relatable character writing and conflict.

If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online. Not that it was bad, just that it felt lacking compared to the two storylines that preceded it. So my expectations going into Sword Art Online: Fa...                    game review          6 comments       Ni no Kuni II:Revenant Kingdom   2018 Mar 21, 22:45 6 comments                 games    It took 8 years for a Ni no Kuni sequel to finally surface, and now that it's here, there's both good news and bad for this lavish Studio Ghibli-esque action RPG. ― Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was a bit too traditional for me. As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty. We've had disappointments like Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage and Berserk and the Band of the Hawk, but we've also had some real win...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Dragon Ball FighterZ   2018 Jan 29, 23:00 3 comments                 games    Dustin Bailey has the full rundown on the most hotly anticipated DBZ fighting game of all time. Find out if FighterZ lives up to all the hype! ― Dragon Ball FighterZ isn't just a good game for fans of Dragon Ball—it's a great game period, a best-in-class fighter that looks great and is fun to play at any level.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games.

How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger.

What will you do with your time in Rigbarth? ― It's a little hard to talk about the Story of Seasons games (and their Rune Factory spin-offs). Not because of the complicated legal snarl involving the Story of Seasons and Harvest Moon branding, but because on the merits that most games woul...                    game review          2 comments       Chocobo GP   Mar 18, 00:00 2 comments                 games    Chocobo GP is a big improvement and an even greater risk.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago. Is it a mere relic or a true deep-cut gem? ― Some games are delayed. Others are canceled. And then there's the unique and bizarre journey of Clockwork Aquario.

The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine.

On the other hand, One's Justice developer Byking are rel...                    game review          2 comments       Fist of the North Star: Paradise Lost   2018 Oct 12, 00:00 2 comments                 games    The classic head-exploding action of Fist of the North Star is poured into the Yakuza gameplay mold, but do these two great tastes taste great together?

We dig into a video-game icon's return! ― Don't let the number fool you. This may be the eleventh or twelfth central Mega Man title. It may be backed by several spin-off series. Yet it's been nearly a decade since the last full-blown game in the series. Even then, Mega Man 9 and 10 were deliberate throwbacks, built t...                    game review          4 comments       Capcom Beat 'Em Up Bundle   2018 Sep 24, 23:00 4 comments                 games    Capcom resurrects a bunch of their classic arcade brawlers with a seven-game collection. Do they still put up a fight? ― Brawlers. Beat 'Em Ups. Belt-Scrollers. Double Dragon Clones. Punk Punching Parades. Those Arcade Games That Mom And Dad Always Said Were Too Violent For You Back in 1988. Whatever you call them, they never quite got their moment on top. True, they were staples of arcades in the la...                    game review          7 comments       Import Review: My Hero One's Justice   2018 Sep 18, 23:00 7 comments                 games    My Hero Academia arrives on consoles and PC as a fully-featured arena brawler bursting with everyone's favorite heroes, but does it go PLUS ULTRA?

Branden Johnson gets lost in the world of Monster Hunter. ― I've long aspired to be the sort of person who is into Monster Hunter.

Richard Eisenbeis delivers his full review of the newest entry in this TRPG saga. ― The Valkyria Chronicles series is a piece of historical fiction set in a world much like our own.

Branden Johnson elaborates. ― Nailing absurdist humor is tricky. If you wink too much at the audience, it can be eye roll-inducing, and if you aren't polished enough in your presentation, you run the risk of your audience laughing at you, not with you. But Nintendo has pulled it o...                    game review          2 comments       Review: Little Witch Academia: Chamber of Time   2018 May 23, 22:00 2 comments                 games    This dungeon-crawling action RPG boasts all the style of Studio Trigger's hit series, but not so much the substance. Todd Ciolek digs into this magical adventure. ― It's neither original nor unkind to say that Little Witch Academia stood out on appearances. The series is a charming tale of a misfit at a magical academy, a fantasy staple since well before Harry Potter, but it might not have leapt from...                    game review          3 comments       REVIEW: Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet   2018 Mar 24, 23:49 3 comments                 games    This run-and-gun RPG for the PS4 allows SAO fans to interact with all their favorite characters in a brand-new story. But is it fun to play? Branden Johnson finds out. ― Unpopular opinion time: my least favorite arc in Sword Art Online was Gun Gale Online.

As a lover of RPGs and the films of Hayao Miyazaki, I figured it would be right up my alley. An RPG that looks and sounds like a real Studio Ghibli film is basically a...                    game review          4 comments       GAME REVIEW: Attack on Titan 2   2018 Mar 16, 22:00 4 comments                 games    This sequel to the first action game in the franchise from KOEI-TECMO and Omega Force makes significant improvements on its predecessor, but is it worth a purchase? Heidi Kemps has the answers. ― Omega Force's record with anime and manga adaptations is a bit spotty.

Heidi breaks down how this game stacks up against its predecessors for prior fans and newcomers alike. ― For being such a long-running game franchise, the Kunio-kun series of beat-em-ups is quite a confusing mess. It's a beat-em-up series about a bunch of high school delinquents fighting for turf and showing who's the toug...                    game review          3 comments       Resident Evil Revelations Collection   2017 Nov 28, 22:00 3 comments                 games    Both RE: Revelations games have arrived in a special re-release for the Nintendo Switch, but is there anything new in this edition worth picking up?

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential. The central RPGs feature anime heroines who represent various game consoles and companies, and that makes for rampant and excusable genre parody. Put the characters in a pop-idol simulation or a strategy-RPG and you're not just cynically exploiting a m...

What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them? As it turns out, plenty. ― There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters,...                    game review          19 comments       Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition   Apr 14, 00:00 19 comments                 games    Chrono Cross returns with a remastered treatment and its never-before-translated predecessor, Radical Dreamers! How do these follow-ups to the cherished RPG classic Chrono Trigger endure after all these years? ― The best way to approach Chrono Cross is to forget that it's a sequel to Chrono Trigger.

Pokémon Legends: Arceus seems to be Game Freak's response to that request, and I'd go out on a limb to say that it's exactly the sort of thing we've been waiting for.

But what exactly are the decisions that got us here? ― Unlike animation, video games are in large part a disposable medium. Games once hailed as era-defining breakthrough titles upon their release often become antiquated and awkward within a little less than a decade. And so we see a plethora of remakes and ...                    game review          3 comments       Clockwork Aquario   Dec 17, 04:00 3 comments                 games    The arcade game Clockwork Aquario finally arrives on modern systems after disappearing twenty-eight years ago.

The greatest appeal of Metallic Child comes from the way it applies the aesthetics of the Japanese Action-RPGs without hol...                    game review          8 comments       Cupid Parasite   Dec  7, 01:00 8 comments                 games    A game with this many strengths is easy to recommend, which is why it's unfortunate that the current game is ridden with typos, ill-fitting text, and the telltale signs of a hastily edited machine translation. ― Cupid Parasite opens with some of the trashiest male love interests you could possibly imagine.

These games have their own unique mechanics that add some much-needed depth to Warrior's combat wh...                    game review          4 comments       Shadowverse: Champion's Battle   Aug 10, 21:00 4 comments                 games    Take on the role of Hiro Ryugasaki as you engage in card duels to save your school club! ― Coming straight from Cygames, Shadowverse: Champion's Battle is a story-based adaptation of the collectible card game app. You play as a youth who meets up with Hiro Ryugasaki, protagonist of the Shadowverse anime, and joins Tensei Academy's Shadowverse club.

It used many of the features of the Nintendo DS in experimental ways an...                    game review          4 comments       Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin   Jul 25, 00:00 4 comments                 games    It's easy to say that Monster Hunter Stories 2 provided the most enjoyable gameplay experience I've had within the genre in recent years. ― The monster-collecting genre might be one of the most criminally under-represented in gaming. Aside from the Pokémon games and the steady trickle of indie projects inspired by that franchise, it's practically barren. It is my hope that Monster Hunter Stories 2 wi...                    game review          4 comments       Akiba's Trip: Hellbound & Debriefed   Jul 21, 00:00 4 comments                 games    Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a cheeky romp through anime fandom mecca with plenty of fun references. But sadly, it's also just shy of the mark to make it a must-have. ― Akiba's Trip: Hellbound and Debriefed is a lot of things. It's a remaster of a 10-year-old PlayStation Portable game.

Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Etrian Odyssey games ask a lot. They require you to pace around dungeon grids full of nasty enemies. They require you to map out levels in the tradition of the hardest RPGs of 1986. They require you to try again and again, even after a sudden and vicious encounter wipes out yo...                    game review          7 comments       Cyberdimension Neptunia: 4 Goddesses Online   2017 Oct 11, 22:15 7 comments                 games    Is this super-meta RPG worth playing for more than its jokes and fanservice? Todd Ciolek finds out. ― Neptunia is a series of inexhaustible potential.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Summer Time Rendering   Apr 15th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Summer Time Rendering ?                     Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more. If you enjoy anime like Steins;Gate, ERASED, Sakurada Reset, or Re:Zero, you'll definitely be intrigued. And as for anyone else, well, you should definitely give it a chance.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Community score: 4.2              What is this?   Upon hearing of Ushio's death, Shinpei returns to his hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima and reunites with his childhood friend's family. The funeral goes smoothly, but under the surface something strange is brewing on the island. (from manga)   Summer Time Rendering is based on Yasuki Tanaka's suspense manga and streams on Disney+ in Japan on Wednesdays.    Note: The series still isn't available for streaming worldwide. Richard Eisenbeis lives in Japan and was able to watch the first episode there, albeit without subtitles.     How was the first episode?    Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                To tell the truth, before today, I had never even heard of Summer Time Rendering. I went into it totally blind—and that is absolutely the way it should be experienced. In fact, if you're already planning to watch it whenever Disney+ decides to set it free in your corner of the world, you should stop reading this review. Just take my word that it's a fantastic 24 minutes and you won't regret keeping yourself in the dark.    As for the rest of you, whether it be those who have already read the manga or those who need to know more before setting aside your time, let's get into it. This first episode of Summer Time Rendering is a master class at playing with tone, making you question what you are watching. At the start it could be any genre of show: we have a kid, Shinpei, going back to his hometown after several years away for the funeral of one of his closest friends, Ushio. But no sooner has he set foot on the island than things seem subtly off: he has strange dreams, there are a ton of well-dressed tourists all about, and his sister Mio seems more excited about his return than sad over the death of her sister. Then things swerve into the suspenseful, as we learn that there are signs Ushio was murdered, before it goes straight into horror when we start hearing about doppelgangers—and how people who have seen them soon disappear without a trace. And then comes the out-of-left-field cliffhanger where things suddenly go full sci-fi.    As all this is going on, there are a ton of things in the background hinting to what is truly going on. Some of these come across in random conversations. Others are visual, brought to life by the show's beautiful animation and its focus on intricate detail. It's a show that you'll want to rewatch even as the credits roll.    All in all, this first episode of Summer Time Rendering is an absolute roller-coaster. It's the best kind of premiere: one that makes it impossible to not want to come back for more.
