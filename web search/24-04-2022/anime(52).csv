News Sentai Filmworks Screens Revue Starlight Anime Film in June With Early May Premiere at Anime Central   posted on 2022-04-22 02:41 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime screens in N. America on June 5-6    Sentai Filmworks announced on Thursday that it will screen Revue Starlight The Movie, the new anime film for the Shōjo Kageki Revue Starlight franchise, in North American theaters in June following an early premiere at the Anime Central convention in Rosemont, Illinois on May 20 at 8:00 p.m. The movie will screen in select theaters on June 5 with an encore presentation on June 6. The company streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      Sentai Filmworks describes the story:   Revue Starlight The Movie picks up soon after the series left off and opens the curtain a new, original story set during Karen Aijo and Hikari Kagura's third year at Seisho Music Academy, a performing arts school for young women who aspire to the heights of on-stage stardom. In the next chapter of their theatrical lives, these young women will face one another on the battlefield of the stage, where song, dance and thrilling swordplay collide to illustrate the rich emotional narratives of the film's protagonists.  The film was previously slated to open in Japan in May 2021, but was delayed to June 2021 due to the state of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting temporary closure of some theaters.    The Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Rondo Rondo Rondo compilation film opened in August 2020. The film was first slated to open in May 2020, but was postponed due to the spread of COVID-19. The new film continues the story of the compilation film.    Bushiroad announced the franchise in April 2017 with a stage musical and television anime project. The musical Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight The LIVE, billed as a  ""2.5 dimension musical and live concert,"" ran in Tokyo in September 2017. The 12-episode television anime series premiered in July 2018. Sentai Filmworks streamed the series on HIDIVE with English subtitles and an English dub. The franchise also inspired a new mini anime titled Shōjo☆Konto All Starlight (Girl Comedy Skit All Starlight), which premiered in July 2019.    Sora Goto and Kanata Nakamura launched Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Overture, the first manga for the franchise, in Kadokawa's Dengeki G's Comic magazine in January 2018, and ended it in October 2018. The franchise also includes the Butai Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight ―The LIVE― SHOW MUST GO ON and Yonkoma Starlight manga.    Ateam's Revue Starlight Re LIVE smartphone game launched worldwide in April 2019. A third stage musical production was slated for July 2020, but was delayed to July 2021 due to COVID-19.

News Sentai Filmworks Screens Revue Starlight Anime Film in June With Early May Premiere at Anime Central   posted on 2022-04-22 02:41 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime screens in N. America on June 5-6    Sentai Filmworks announced on Thursday that it will screen Revue Starlight The Movie, the new anime film for the Shōjo Kageki Revue Starlight franchise, in North American theaters in June following an early premiere at the Anime Central convention in Rosemont, Illinois on May 20 at 8:00 p.m. The movie will screen in select theaters on June 5 with an encore presentation on June 6. The company streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      Sentai Filmworks describes the story:   Revue Starlight The Movie picks up soon after the series left off and opens the curtain a new, original story set during Karen Aijo and Hikari Kagura's third year at Seisho Music Academy, a performing arts school for young women who aspire to the heights of on-stage stardom. In the next chapter of their theatrical lives, these young women will face one another on the battlefield of the stage, where song, dance and thrilling swordplay collide to illustrate the rich emotional narratives of the film's protagonists.  The film was previously slated to open in Japan in May 2021, but was delayed to June 2021 due to the state of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting temporary closure of some theaters.    The Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Rondo Rondo Rondo compilation film opened in August 2020. The film was first slated to open in May 2020, but was postponed due to the spread of COVID-19. The new film continues the story of the compilation film.    Bushiroad announced the franchise in April 2017 with a stage musical and television anime project. The musical Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight The LIVE, billed as a  ""2.5 dimension musical and live concert,"" ran in Tokyo in September 2017. The 12-episode television anime series premiered in July 2018. Sentai Filmworks streamed the series on HIDIVE with English subtitles and an English dub. The franchise also inspired a new mini anime titled Shōjo☆Konto All Starlight (Girl Comedy Skit All Starlight), which premiered in July 2019.    Sora Goto and Kanata Nakamura launched Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Overture, the first manga for the franchise, in Kadokawa's Dengeki G's Comic magazine in January 2018, and ended it in October 2018. The franchise also includes the Butai Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight ―The LIVE― SHOW MUST GO ON and Yonkoma Starlight manga.    Ateam's Revue Starlight Re LIVE smartphone game launched worldwide in April 2019. A third stage musical production was slated for July 2020, but was delayed to July 2021 due to COVID-19.

News Sentai Filmworks Screens Revue Starlight Anime Film in June With Early May Premiere at Anime Central   posted on 2022-04-22 02:41 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime screens in N. America on June 5-6    Sentai Filmworks announced on Thursday that it will screen Revue Starlight The Movie, the new anime film for the Shōjo Kageki Revue Starlight franchise, in North American theaters in June following an early premiere at the Anime Central convention in Rosemont, Illinois on May 20 at 8:00 p.m. The movie will screen in select theaters on June 5 with an encore presentation on June 6. The company streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      Sentai Filmworks describes the story:   Revue Starlight The Movie picks up soon after the series left off and opens the curtain a new, original story set during Karen Aijo and Hikari Kagura's third year at Seisho Music Academy, a performing arts school for young women who aspire to the heights of on-stage stardom. In the next chapter of their theatrical lives, these young women will face one another on the battlefield of the stage, where song, dance and thrilling swordplay collide to illustrate the rich emotional narratives of the film's protagonists.  The film was previously slated to open in Japan in May 2021, but was delayed to June 2021 due to the state of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting temporary closure of some theaters.    The Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Rondo Rondo Rondo compilation film opened in August 2020. The film was first slated to open in May 2020, but was postponed due to the spread of COVID-19. The new film continues the story of the compilation film.    Bushiroad announced the franchise in April 2017 with a stage musical and television anime project. The musical Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight The LIVE, billed as a  ""2.5 dimension musical and live concert,"" ran in Tokyo in September 2017. The 12-episode television anime series premiered in July 2018. Sentai Filmworks streamed the series on HIDIVE with English subtitles and an English dub. The franchise also inspired a new mini anime titled Shōjo☆Konto All Starlight (Girl Comedy Skit All Starlight), which premiered in July 2019.    Sora Goto and Kanata Nakamura launched Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Overture, the first manga for the franchise, in Kadokawa's Dengeki G's Comic magazine in January 2018, and ended it in October 2018. The franchise also includes the Butai Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight ―The LIVE― SHOW MUST GO ON and Yonkoma Starlight manga.    Ateam's Revue Starlight Re LIVE smartphone game launched worldwide in April 2019. A third stage musical production was slated for July 2020, but was delayed to July 2021 due to COVID-19.

The company streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      Sentai Filmworks describes the story:   Revue Starlight The Movie picks up soon after the series left off and opens the curtain a new, original story set during Karen Aijo and Hikari Kagura's third year at Seisho Music Academy, a performing arts school for young women who aspire to the heights of on-stage stardom. In the next chapter of their theatrical lives, these young women will face one another on the battlefield of the stage, where song, dance and thrilling swordplay collide to illustrate the rich emotional narratives of the film's protagonists.  The film was previously slated to open in Japan in May 2021, but was delayed to June 2021 due to the state of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting temporary closure of some theaters.    The Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Rondo Rondo Rondo compilation film opened in August 2020. The film was first slated to open in May 2020, but was postponed due to the spread of COVID-19. The new film continues the story of the compilation film.    Bushiroad announced the franchise in April 2017 with a stage musical and television anime project. The musical Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight The LIVE, billed as a  ""2.5 dimension musical and live concert,"" ran in Tokyo in September 2017. The 12-episode television anime series premiered in July 2018. Sentai Filmworks streamed the series on HIDIVE with English subtitles and an English dub. The franchise also inspired a new mini anime titled Shōjo☆Konto All Starlight (Girl Comedy Skit All Starlight), which premiered in July 2019.    Sora Goto and Kanata Nakamura launched Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Overture, the first manga for the franchise, in Kadokawa's Dengeki G's Comic magazine in January 2018, and ended it in October 2018. The franchise also includes the Butai Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight ―The LIVE― SHOW MUST GO ON and Yonkoma Starlight manga.

News Ryota Takeuchi Joins Cast of Spriggan Anime as Larry Markson   posted on 2022-04-22 19:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime premieres on Netflix worldwide on June 18    The official website for david production's new anime series based on Hiroshi Takashige and Ryōji Minagawa's Spriggan (Striker) manga revealed on Friday that Ryota Takeuchi will play Larry Markson in the series.     The show will premiere on Netflix worldwide on June 18.    The anime stars:    Chiaki Kobayashi as protagonist Yū Ominae   Yōhei Azakami as Jean Jacquemonde   Kenji Hamada as Chief Yamamoto   Mariya Ise as Yoshino Somei   Ken Narita as Kōichi Moroha   Ayumu Murase as Colonel McDougal   Yoshimasa Hosoya as Iwao Akatsuki    Hiroshi Kobayashi (Rage of Bahamut Genesis assistant director, Kill la Kill episode director) is directing the anime. Hiroshi Seko (Attack on Titan, Mob Psycho 100, Jujutsu Kaisen) is supervising and writing the series scripts, and Shūhei Handa (Little Witch Academia) is designing the characters and serving as chief animation director.    The manga's story centers on Yū Ominae, a high school student who is also a Spriggan, an agent charged by the ARCAM Corporation to protect the ancient relics of an advanced older civilization from falling into the hands of states and entities who wish to misuse them.    Takashige wrote the Spriggan manga with artist Minagawa beginning in 1989. Viz Media published edited versions of three of the manga's eleven volumes as Striker in North America from 1998 to 1999. The manga inspired an anime film in 1998. ADV Films released the film in 2002 with an English dub.

News Ryota Takeuchi Joins Cast of Spriggan Anime as Larry Markson   posted on 2022-04-22 19:07 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Anime premieres on Netflix worldwide on June 18    The official website for david production's new anime series based on Hiroshi Takashige and Ryōji Minagawa's Spriggan (Striker) manga revealed on Friday that Ryota Takeuchi will play Larry Markson in the series.     The show will premiere on Netflix worldwide on June 18.    The anime stars:    Chiaki Kobayashi as protagonist Yū Ominae   Yōhei Azakami as Jean Jacquemonde   Kenji Hamada as Chief Yamamoto   Mariya Ise as Yoshino Somei   Ken Narita as Kōichi Moroha   Ayumu Murase as Colonel McDougal   Yoshimasa Hosoya as Iwao Akatsuki    Hiroshi Kobayashi (Rage of Bahamut Genesis assistant director, Kill la Kill episode director) is directing the anime. Hiroshi Seko (Attack on Titan, Mob Psycho 100, Jujutsu Kaisen) is supervising and writing the series scripts, and Shūhei Handa (Little Witch Academia) is designing the characters and serving as chief animation director.

These ports are based on the mobile ports, so it'll let you choose either soundtrack, but the Japanese OP song will probably be an instrumental cover like in that version due to rights issues.

There's always a chance that Sega will release a physical version once any existing bugs have been worked out and all DLC has been released. It's worth noting that Sonic Mania didn't get a physical release either until the upgraded 'plus' version came out almost a year later.   Worst case I'm sure a company like Limited Run Games will release a physical version if Sega doesn't Last edited by Megax36 on Thu Apr 21, 2022 12:10 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  Redlinks    Joined: 14 Feb 2010 		    Posts: 484 		    Location: America 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 11:04 pm            I shall wait for the physical release of this game.

So not put up some GameGear games and other Mega-Drive games, maybe do the first re-release of Knuckles' Chaotix. Maybe the extra content would make for it, something to revival Sonic Jam.

I've heard great things about the mobile ports and playing that version of CD on PS3 was a lot of fun so I'll be looking forward to this.

Doesn't make any difference to me, I'd opt to play the originals in they are included anyway. What does matter to me is what games are available, and my combined copies of Mega Collection Plus and Gems Collection blow this out of the water. The only advantage I can see is this having the proper CD OST, Gems had a different OST to the Mega-CD version.

M            True but at the same time not everyone owns a Genesis, Sega CD, Saturn, Gamecube, GBA, PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360, Switch, DS, 3DS, or PC. And even if anyone did own these older platforms and the versions of these games released on them you know they’d still buy this.

That’s as likely to see a rerelease as Segasonic Arcade and a finished version of SegaSonic Bros.

These ports are based on the mobile ports, so it'll let you choose either soundtrack, but the Japanese OP song will probably be an instrumental cover like in that version due to rights issues.

There's always a chance that Sega will release a physical version once any existing bugs have been worked out and all DLC has been released. It's worth noting that Sonic Mania didn't get a physical release either until the upgraded 'plus' version came out almost a year later.   Worst case I'm sure a company like Limited Run Games will release a physical version if Sega doesn't Last edited by Megax36 on Thu Apr 21, 2022 12:10 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  Redlinks    Joined: 14 Feb 2010 		    Posts: 484 		    Location: America 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 11:04 pm            I shall wait for the physical release of this game.

So not put up some GameGear games and other Mega-Drive games, maybe do the first re-release of Knuckles' Chaotix. Maybe the extra content would make for it, something to revival Sonic Jam.

I've heard great things about the mobile ports and playing that version of CD on PS3 was a lot of fun so I'll be looking forward to this.

Doesn't make any difference to me, I'd opt to play the originals in they are included anyway. What does matter to me is what games are available, and my combined copies of Mega Collection Plus and Gems Collection blow this out of the water. The only advantage I can see is this having the proper CD OST, Gems had a different OST to the Mega-CD version.

M            True but at the same time not everyone owns a Genesis, Sega CD, Saturn, Gamecube, GBA, PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360, Switch, DS, 3DS, or PC. And even if anyone did own these older platforms and the versions of these games released on them you know they’d still buy this.

That’s as likely to see a rerelease as Segasonic Arcade and a finished version of SegaSonic Bros.

There's always a chance that Sega will release a physical version once any existing bugs have been worked out and all DLC has been released. It's worth noting that Sonic Mania didn't get a physical release either until the upgraded 'plus' version came out almost a year later.   Worst case I'm sure a company like Limited Run Games will release a physical version if Sega doesn't Last edited by Megax36 on Thu Apr 21, 2022 12:10 am; edited 1 time in total     Back to top                  Redlinks    Joined: 14 Feb 2010 		    Posts: 484 		    Location: America 		        Posted: Wed Apr 20, 2022 11:04 pm            I shall wait for the physical release of this game.

Doesn't make any difference to me, I'd opt to play the originals in they are included anyway. What does matter to me is what games are available, and my combined copies of Mega Collection Plus and Gems Collection blow this out of the water. The only advantage I can see is this having the proper CD OST, Gems had a different OST to the Mega-CD version.

M            True but at the same time not everyone owns a Genesis, Sega CD, Saturn, Gamecube, GBA, PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360, Switch, DS, 3DS, or PC. And even if anyone did own these older platforms and the versions of these games released on them you know they’d still buy this.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and give the series a shot.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

(from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good.

James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Thermae Romae Novae   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.    All in all, I don't know if it's my cup of tea but it certainly wasn't bad.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up.

24-04-2022,anime,5,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/thermae-romae-novae/.183660,Thermae Romae Novae - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Thermae Romae Novae (ONA) ?                     Community score: 3.1              What is this?   In Hadrian Rome, Lucius was a Roman architect whose designs often got rejected by builders. To cheer him up a friend of his invited him to relax at a thermae (public bath). Inside the bath Lucius was accidentally trapped in an underwater hole by suction; when he finally managed to emerge on the surface he found himself in a very different bath: in 20th century Japan.    Thermae Romae Novae is based on Mari Yamazaki's manga and is currently streaming on Netflix.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                One of the things that comes with having major ADHD is learning how to manage constantly shifting hyperfixations, which is to say that I can totally understand how something like Thermae Romae Novae could come into existence. I've spent a frankly embarrassing amount of hours obsessing over kaiju movies, tokusatsu shows, Gunpla models, and The Muppets (and that's just the stuff I've gotten into over the last five years or so), so I'm not all surprised to learn that there exists at least one person in the world whose love for ancient history, architecture, and public bathhouses intersected with such ferocity that an entire multi-media franchise was born.    Here's my main issue with Thermae Romae Novae: While I'm certainly always down to dig into some history and culture lessons, I myself don't particularly care about architecture, and I've never even stepped foot inside of a public bathhouse. Our main character, Lucius, has precisely two personality traits: He freaking loves architecture, and his dream in life is to—and I quote—“Build bathhouses that make everyone smile!” Even when you include the series' novel time-travel angle (which doesn't really impact the first episode of the show at all), the core of Thermae Romae Novae's appeal lies in its unapologetic obsession with bathhouse cultures past and present.    What that means is that, outside of the very specific niche appeal of the bathhouses themselves, I'm not finding much else to latch onto with this story. The historical drama isn't well-written enough to hold up on its own, and there's not much humor to be found outside of that. In short, while the material here is perfectly fine for an educational documentary, I'm not sure it makes for the kind of anime that I want to sit down and watch on a regular basis.    Heck, the anime actually comes with live-action documentary segments that close out its episodes, and I find those much more compelling than the rest of the show that they're attached to. The segments that follow author Mari Yamazaki's quest to “rediscover Japanese bathhouse culture” are genuinely interesting and feature some lovely footage of real-world bathhouse settings, and the anime's relatively drab and uninspired visuals simply don't hold up in comparison. It doesn't help that, in all of the scenes set inside the thermae themselves (of which there are many), the show slaps this hideous and cheap looking steam filter on top of the screen.    I've heard that Thermae Romae has a sizeable fan-base, so it's quite possible that future episodes of the show would give me more of a reason to stick around and get invested in the bathhouse mania of it all. As it stands, though, I don't think Thermae Romae Novae is for me; at the very least, if I ever do come back to the show, I can easily imagine skipping all of the anime parts to get to the documentary bits. That's apparently where the real bathhouse action is at.        Caitlin Moore  Rating:               The manga of Thermae Romae is a critically-acclaimed award winner. The first anime adaptation was a low-budget short that developed a cult following for its quirky humor. The new series that just premiered on Netflix, Thermae Romae Novae, has a TV run's worth of full-length episodes, complete with attempts at pathos and backstory, and has the same director as the critically-panned Africa Salaryman. It is also boring.    For a series with a concept as weird as “Roman architect time travels through a portal in a bath for inspiration,” you really don't need to put a lot of effort into building up character motivation. Yet for some reason, they felt the need to give Lucius a reason to really love baths and a tragic childhood involving a dead father and bullies. Can't he just be a dude who loves soaking in hot water and designing new ways to do it? The first episode has no jokes and just feels long, drawn-out, and pointless.    Yet somehow, that's not the most baffling decision the anime staff made. You see, the people in togas and marble buildings with columns aren't enough to make us realize this shit all happened a long time ago. We couldn't possibly manage to figure that out on our own. The distant past was all sepia-toned, right? They didn't invent bright colors until the '50s! Everything up until then was muddy and dim. Unfortunately, the half-assed color design, along with the pen-and-ink style shading, makes it look like everything has been rubbed with dirt. In a series about bathing and cleanliness. It's silly.    Maybe Thermae Romae Novae picks up after this. I hear it has Kenjiro Tsuda yelling in Latin, so that's something.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                It's funny, Thermae Romae is so mainstream here in Japan that despite never having read a page of the manga nor having seen the live-action film, I already knew the basic setup through cultural osmosis alone—which is why watching this threw me for a bit of a loop. What I was expecting was a time-traveling Roman being awed by some facet of Japanese hot spring culture over and over again. And while that may be what the series turns into, this first episode was most certainly not.    Rather, this episode gives us the backstory for our series' protagonist Lucius, showing why he became a bathhouse architect and where his philosophy on bathing came from. But more than that, this episode is about how blue-collar workers find importance and pride in their daily toil. For a mason, it's knowing that their work will record the past and inspire the future. For Lucius' father and grandfather, it's about creating a place where people can be purged of stress and be ready to face a new day. In other words, they may be cogs in Roman society, but they know that they are vital to its functioning.    It makes for a solid setup to the series, even if it's ultimately not representative of the rest of the show. It's just a shame that the animation doesn't really hold up. In wide shots there is a noticeable drop in detail and in scenes with any kind of quick movement, it looks choppy to say the least. And the live-action ending with the author of the manga is pretty much Japanese TV in a nutshell—i.e., a person traveling around Japan talking about how cool some aspect of Japanese culture (usually food) really is.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness   Apr  7th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness ?                     Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma.

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                 Plot-wise, this anime is quite simple: a man moves back into his parents' home to help out with the family business only to discover they have taken in an orphan. Needless to say, rather than being plot-driven, this anime is character-driven. And although it has only 22 minutes of runtime, Deaimon does some darn good character building.    On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

On one hand we have Nogamu: the man with no shame. He wears his heart on his sleeve and lets criticism bounce off of him like it's nothing. What's interesting is that he did have someone whose words he took to heart: his late grandfather. The reason he left the family business in the first place, despite loving it dearly, was overhearing his grandfather say he wasn't suited for the job. And rather than confronting his grandfather, he ran away to Tokyo to become a musician instead.    Our secondary lead, Itsuka has also built her world around the words of the most important person in her life: her father. Unwilling or unable to continue his life as a single father, Itsuka's father abandoned her with Nogamu's family, telling the young girl that she was useless shortly before disappearing into the night. Thus, Itsuka is determined to be useful—to show the world that she is not only self-sufficient but can be depended on when troubles arise. Of course, despite the pain and anger in her heart, it's clear that her reason for becoming this way isn't to prove her father wrong but rather the irrational hope that should she succeed, her father will return for her. It's heartbreaking, especially when you remember she actively goes to the train station after school looking for men with guitars (the image she has of her father).    And what's interesting is that while Nogamu's mother wants him to take on a fatherly role in Itsuka's life, that's not what she needs now. What she needs is a friend who can understand what she's going through—someone who understands that the words of someone you love can shape your entire world. That is what Nogamu an Itsuka share and that will be the basis for their relationship as things continue forward. It's a solid emotional core to build a series around and I look forward to seeing how things go next week.      Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                 Alright, time for another Dad anime! It's been a little while since we last got a show about a single 30-something dude suddenly becoming a parental figure to a young girl, and since we still haven't gotten a second season of Barakamon, this cozy little muffin of a show will have to do. I use muffin because I know precisely nothing about traditional Japanese sweets. But I do know a thing or two about found family shows, and so far Deiamon's off to a decent, if unexceptional start.    Though the Dad Anime bit may be a little premature. Sure, the show itself is insistent about it – Itsuka first meets Nagomu by mistaking him for her absentee father, and Nagomu's own mother basically asks him to become the girl's surrogate parent. But Nagomu himself doesn't really have Dad energy, adoptive or otherwise. He's got the vibe of an adult older brother who went off to do his own thing after college, or sometimes he's kind of Steve from Blue's Clues where he seems as much like a child as the actual 10-year-old. This gives him a somewhat unique dynamic with Itsuka that can be pretty charming at its best, but can also feel too vague to give their interactions the bite necessary to carry a lot of this episode.    Itsuka, on the other hand, is all but certainly going to carry this show if the premiere is anything to go on. Her personal conflict of feeling she has to be “useful” in order to maintain her place at the shop – and with her loving caretakers – speaks to some serious trauma. And seeing her slowly come to accept the unconditional love of her new home and family could be heartwarming as all get-out. So if they can build a good rapport between here and Nagomu, I think there's room for a really nice show in here.    I just wish the way we got to all that was a little less clumsy. There's a scene where, unprompted, Nagomu just unloads his entire backstory for leaving the family business for a full decade, and it's all built on how he gets really upset over selling his family's beloved sweets to other people. Meanwhile the climactic conflict comes from some random person prank calling the store with a fake order, and I guess none of the adults at the store thought to get contact information or take any sort of deposit before committing to a big(?) order of sweets. It's an awkward and contrived way to have Itsuka mess up without actually messing up, so that it can be easily resolved in time for credits to roll, which makes the resolution feel artificial. In a show that is built on personal emotions and relationships, that's a bad sign.    But those could just be growing pains from having to get all of this out in a single episode, and I'd like it if the show could find its footing. It's no Barakamon, but few things are. If it can get its act together, Deiamon could be plenty sweet and filling.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                At least one star of this rating is for the scrumptious looking traditional Japanese sweets. That's important, since the show is set in a traditional confectionery, but even so each little manju and treat is a beautiful work of art that simultaneously makes you want to eat them and to carefully display them on the mantelpiece. I fully admit that I have a very, very sweet tooth, but even if I didn't the glimpses we get of the confections are just lovely.    That stands to be what this series is as a whole – just lovely, although certainly not without its angst. The confectionery, run by an older couple, is also home to two young people who are trying to work through some pretty heavy subjects in their lives. Nagomu, finally returning home after ten years, is coping with what looks an awful lot like a failed career as some sort of chestnut-themed singer while also coming to terms with the overheard conversation that sent him packing a decade ago. That almost pales in comparison to poor little Itsuka, whose father, a distant acquaintance of the shop owners, basically dumped her with them a year ago. That's put Itsuka in an unbearable position – a piece of her seems to know that the couple regards her as their grandchild and truly love her, but she also feels like she has to go above and beyond to make herself “valuable” to them, to prove that she deserves her place in their home. Presumably telling her that she would someday inherit the confectionary was intended to show her that they had no intention of throwing her out; instead it's become an additional burden on the girl, who now feels that she must be an even more determined worker to prove that she's allowed to be their grandchild.    That she'd see Nagumo as a threat since he's actually blood-related family makes a lot of sense, and not just to Itsuka. Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.1              What is this?   Nagomu is a man who left his home in Kyoto and his family's confectionary shop when he became a musician. Upon hearing that his father has been hospitalized though, he comes back home to take over the family business. However, while he was gone, a young girl named Itsuka started working at the shop. The whereabouts of Itsuka's parents is unknown, and she has no other relatives, and Nagomu finds himself as foster parent for Itsuka. Itsuka, on the other hand, dislikes Nagomu for abandoning the family to become a musician. She proclaims that it will be her who will take over the shop one day instead of Nagomu.    Deaimon: Recipe for Happiness is based on Rin Asano's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Wednesdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                 While perhaps Usagi Drop is the most obvious comparison, Deaimon reminded me most of Poco's Udon World, a lovely series about a man who moves back home to take over his family's udon shop and finds himself caring for a young tanuki as a father figure that no one watched. It's cozy and gentle, exploring the intersection and tensions between modern adulthood and maintaining family and cultural traditions. Nagomu always genuinely loved the wagashi he made, but his love was a bit too intense and he ended up pursuing a career as a musician instead. Now that his band has broken up, he comes home and has to renavigate his relationship with his family, with wagashi, and with this new little interloper named Itsuka.    Okay, “interloper” is a little rude and not even really representative of how Nagumo or the show's narrative regard her. After all, it's not like Itsuka chose to be there; she was abandoned by her parents, left in the hands of basically strangers, and feels obligated to work far harder than any ten-year-old should need to. The way the two play off each other is sweet. Nagumo is a huge goof, a big puppyish man full of nothing but love, enthusiasm, and a willingness to make a fool of himself, while Itsuka is far too serious and hardworking for her age, denying her own childhood due to her sense of obligation and trauma over abandonment.    I've seen this described as “dadime” (a portmanteau of ""dad"" and ""anime""), which is one of my personal weaknesses. While Nagumo is old enough to be Itsuka's father, I don't think it's quite accurate. He's more of a big brother than a dad, but either way, he's exactly what Itsuka needs. I look forward to seeing their relationship unfold.      James Beckett  Rating:                 I'm the kind of guy that's awfully susceptible to the allure of “Dad Simulators” like The Walking Dead games or The Last of Us, though I haven't had so much luck with such subject matter in anime outside of a select few titles (Hinamatsuri comes to mind, and maybe Kakushigoto). Maybe that means I just have an unhealthy fixation on grimdark tragedies stuffed with zombies and betrayal, or maybe I just have a hard time vibing with the overly cutesy approach that comedy anime tend to approach the concept with. I also love the culinary arts, though, and I was interested to see if Deaimon clicked with me because of the educational potential.    I wasn't one hundred percent on board with the central dynamic that Nagomu and Itsuka shared at first, but they could become quite endearing given enough time. There's not much to say about Nagomu at first, a rather run-of-the-mill sort of guy that fails to inspire a whole lot of interest on his own, and Itsuka's arrival as the supposed “true” heir of the family confectionary came across as a bit contrived for my tastes. The best of these surrogate-father-meets-unlikely-daughter stories make the two characters seem like a natural fit for one another, even when they're at odds, and I just wasn't sure if this pair had that level of chemistry.    By the end of the episode, though, I was feeling more positively about the story. Itsuka is trying her gosh best to do a good job, and she deserves a pat on the head, damn it. The way that she and Nagomu are able to slowly forge their familial bond is predictable but eventually rather sweet. I could see Deaimon growing on me a lot of its protagonists continue to develop and grow at a solid pace. I don't know if this anime is going to skyrocket to the top of my watchlist, but I'll gladly check out another episode or two, just in case it ends up being a surprise success after all.

Her adoptive grandmother is well aware of how hard Itsuka is working herself and of the insecurities plaguing her, and while her request that Nagumo parent the girl (who, heartbreakingly, still looks for her missing dad at the train station frequently) is a bit much, it's also easy to see that she thinks she's helping both of them. And really, Nagumo is well-placed to help Itsuka deal with things, because he's the one she's afraid is usurping her place. It's all very poignant, and while those of us burned by the Bunny Drop manga's second half may be leery, I think this is going to be sweet in a few senses of the word.

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend.

In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty.

And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom.

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

(My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be.

Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple.

News New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   posted on 2022-04-21 18:18 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Hana, other new characters teased    The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit. The commercial spot and accompanying visuals tease Hana — the son of Yoh and Anna — as well as other new characters.        The two ""Thank-You visuals"" show the characters now and seven years later (with Hana in the second visual).        Takei launched Shaman King Flowers — the sequel manga centering around Hana — in Jump X magazine in 2012, and he ended it in the magazine's final issue in 2014. Takei then launched the new Shaman King The Super Star spinoff  in 2017, although he put it on hiatus in September 2021. Kodansha publishes both manga in English.   The new Shaman King anime premiered in April 2021. Netflix began streaming the anime worldwide on August 9. The anime ended with 52 episodes.    The anime adapted all 35 volumes of the original manga's new complete edition, which Kodansha started publishing in print volumes in Japan in June 2020. The first anime adaptation of the manga premiered in 2001.    Joji Furuta (The Seven Deadly Sins: Revival of The Commandments, Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Double Decker! Doug & Kirill, ēlDLIVE) directed the anime at Bridge (Fairy Tail, The Royal Tutor). Shoji Yonemura (Pokémon franchise, Wave, Listen to Me!) was in charge of the series scripts. Satohiko Sano (Heybot!, Welcome to Demon School, Iruma-kun, Talentless Nana) designed the characters. Yuki Hayashi (My Hero Academia, Haikyu!!) composed the music, with King Record as the music producer. Masafumi Mima was the audio director.

News New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   posted on 2022-04-21 18:18 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Hana, other new characters teased    The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit. The commercial spot and accompanying visuals tease Hana — the son of Yoh and Anna — as well as other new characters.        The two ""Thank-You visuals"" show the characters now and seven years later (with Hana in the second visual).        Takei launched Shaman King Flowers — the sequel manga centering around Hana — in Jump X magazine in 2012, and he ended it in the magazine's final issue in 2014. Takei then launched the new Shaman King The Super Star spinoff  in 2017, although he put it on hiatus in September 2021. Kodansha publishes both manga in English.   The new Shaman King anime premiered in April 2021. Netflix began streaming the anime worldwide on August 9. The anime ended with 52 episodes.    The anime adapted all 35 volumes of the original manga's new complete edition, which Kodansha started publishing in print volumes in Japan in June 2020. The first anime adaptation of the manga premiered in 2001.    Joji Furuta (The Seven Deadly Sins: Revival of The Commandments, Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Double Decker! Doug & Kirill, ēlDLIVE) directed the anime at Bridge (Fairy Tail, The Royal Tutor). Shoji Yonemura (Pokémon franchise, Wave, Listen to Me!) was in charge of the series scripts. Satohiko Sano (Heybot!, Welcome to Demon School, Iruma-kun, Talentless Nana) designed the characters. Yuki Hayashi (My Hero Academia, Haikyu!!) composed the music, with King Record as the music producer. Masafumi Mima was the audio director.

News New Shaman King Anime Gets Sequel   posted on 2022-04-21 18:18 UTC-8 by Egan Loo         Hana, other new characters teased    The new television anime of Hiroyuki Takei's Shaman King manga ended on Tuesday with an ad announcing that a sequel has been green-lit. The commercial spot and accompanying visuals tease Hana — the son of Yoh and Anna — as well as other new characters.        The two ""Thank-You visuals"" show the characters now and seven years later (with Hana in the second visual).        Takei launched Shaman King Flowers — the sequel manga centering around Hana — in Jump X magazine in 2012, and he ended it in the magazine's final issue in 2014. Takei then launched the new Shaman King The Super Star spinoff  in 2017, although he put it on hiatus in September 2021. Kodansha publishes both manga in English.   The new Shaman King anime premiered in April 2021. Netflix began streaming the anime worldwide on August 9. The anime ended with 52 episodes.    The anime adapted all 35 volumes of the original manga's new complete edition, which Kodansha started publishing in print volumes in Japan in June 2020. The first anime adaptation of the manga premiered in 2001.    Joji Furuta (The Seven Deadly Sins: Revival of The Commandments, Uta no Prince Sama Maji Love Kingdom, Double Decker! Doug & Kirill, ēlDLIVE) directed the anime at Bridge (Fairy Tail, The Royal Tutor). Shoji Yonemura (Pokémon franchise, Wave, Listen to Me!) was in charge of the series scripts. Satohiko Sano (Heybot!, Welcome to Demon School, Iruma-kun, Talentless Nana) designed the characters. Yuki Hayashi (My Hero Academia, Haikyu!!) composed the music, with King Record as the music producer. Masafumi Mima was the audio director.

(The anime's real-life setting is Gifu Prefecture's Takayama City.)    The story of HYOUKA follows a boy named Hōtarō who is not assertive about getting involved, but was ordered by his older sister to join the classic literature club. In the club, he gets close to the truth about an incident, involving a female member's uncle, which happened 33 years ago. The ""energy-saving"" boy is joined by an inquisitive girl in this adolescent mystery.    Yonezawa published the original novel in 2001, and it inspired Kyoto Animation's 22-episode television anime adaptation in 2012, as well as a manga adaptation in Kadokawa's Monthly Shōnen Ace magazine. The series also inspired a live-action film, which open in Japan in 2017.    Funimation announced in 2017 that it had licensed the HYOUKA television anime series. Crunchyroll added the series in March following the Crunchyroll-Funimation merger.

Interest Hyouka Anime Celebrates 10th Anniversary With Mini-Exhibit, Online Lottery   posted on 2022-04-23 00:45 UTC-8 by Kim Morrissy           Kyoto Animation's HYOUKA television anime debuted in Japan on April 22, 2012. To commemorate its 10th anniversary, the series has unveiled a new logo, as well as a mini-exhibit and online lottery.     Akihabara's GAMERS store will hold the anime's 10th anniversary mini-exhibit in its main branch from May 25 to June 15. Kujibikido will hold an online lottery. Abema streamed the first eleven episodes on Friday, and Gifu Broadcasting has been rebroadcasting the anime in the region where the anime is set since April 6. (The anime's real-life setting is Gifu Prefecture's Takayama City.)    The story of HYOUKA follows a boy named Hōtarō who is not assertive about getting involved, but was ordered by his older sister to join the classic literature club. In the club, he gets close to the truth about an incident, involving a female member's uncle, which happened 33 years ago. The ""energy-saving"" boy is joined by an inquisitive girl in this adolescent mystery.    Yonezawa published the original novel in 2001, and it inspired Kyoto Animation's 22-episode television anime adaptation in 2012, as well as a manga adaptation in Kadokawa's Monthly Shōnen Ace magazine. The series also inspired a live-action film, which open in Japan in 2017.    Funimation announced in 2017 that it had licensed the HYOUKA television anime series. Crunchyroll added the series in March following the Crunchyroll-Funimation merger.

To commemorate its 10th anniversary, the series has unveiled a new logo, as well as a mini-exhibit and online lottery.     Akihabara's GAMERS store will hold the anime's 10th anniversary mini-exhibit in its main branch from May 25 to June 15. Kujibikido will hold an online lottery. Abema streamed the first eleven episodes on Friday, and Gifu Broadcasting has been rebroadcasting the anime in the region where the anime is set since April 6.

The story of HYOUKA follows a boy named Hōtarō who is not assertive about getting involved, but was ordered by his older sister to join the classic literature club. In the club, he gets close to the truth about an incident, involving a female member's uncle, which happened 33 years ago. The ""energy-saving"" boy is joined by an inquisitive girl in this adolescent mystery.    Yonezawa published the original novel in 2001, and it inspired Kyoto Animation's 22-episode television anime adaptation in 2012, as well as a manga adaptation in Kadokawa's Monthly Shōnen Ace magazine.

Road to Show!!, the new theatrical anime film for Happy Elements' Ensemble Stars! franchise, has sold  over 250,000 tickets for over 350 million yen (about US$2.72 million) as of Thursday.

The film opened in theaters in Japan on March 4. The film ranked at #6 in its opening weekend.    The anime takes place in New York and features the characters visiting New York to attend an Idol Film Festival.    Masakazu Hishida returned to direct the film at david production, and Asami Nakatani was the chief director. Seitarō Kino from Happy Elements wrote the screenplay, and Happy Elements is again credited with the original character design. Haruko Iizuka was the animation character designer and the chief animation director. Tatsuya Katō again composed the music.    The ""idol-training produce game"" takes place at a private boys' idol-training school with a history of turning out many great talents in show business. The protagonist is the school's lone female student who transfers to the school because of a special situation, and enters the school's producer department. The game features 14 different idol units and has a cast of more than 50 male voice actors.    The television anime adaptation of the game premiered in July 2019. The cast from the game returned for the anime. The franchise also includes a manga, novels, stage musical adaptations, and CDs.    Happy Elements launched the Ensemble Stars!! Basic and Ensemble Stars!! Music apps in March 2020. The two apps feature new content for the idol franchise as well as a new gameplay style. The main Ensemble Stars! game changed its name to Ensemble Stars!! Basic with the launch. The ""Basic"" app allows players to continue playing the app as they always have.

Anime Film Earns Over 350 Million Yen   posted on 2022-04-22 10:40 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film opened on March 4, has sold 250,000 tickets    Ensemble Stars!! Road to Show!!, the new theatrical anime film for Happy Elements' Ensemble Stars! franchise, has sold  over 250,000 tickets for over 350 million yen (about US$2.72 million) as of Thursday.    The film began screening in 13 more theaters on Friday, and will be available for rental streaming on Amazon Prime Video in Japan from April 28 to August 27.    The film opened in theaters in Japan on March 4. The film ranked at #6 in its opening weekend.    The anime takes place in New York and features the characters visiting New York to attend an Idol Film Festival.    Masakazu Hishida returned to direct the film at david production, and Asami Nakatani was the chief director. Seitarō Kino from Happy Elements wrote the screenplay, and Happy Elements is again credited with the original character design. Haruko Iizuka was the animation character designer and the chief animation director. Tatsuya Katō again composed the music.    The ""idol-training produce game"" takes place at a private boys' idol-training school with a history of turning out many great talents in show business. The protagonist is the school's lone female student who transfers to the school because of a special situation, and enters the school's producer department. The game features 14 different idol units and has a cast of more than 50 male voice actors.    The television anime adaptation of the game premiered in July 2019. The cast from the game returned for the anime. The franchise also includes a manga, novels, stage musical adaptations, and CDs.    Happy Elements launched the Ensemble Stars!! Basic and Ensemble Stars!! Music apps in March 2020. The two apps feature new content for the idol franchise as well as a new gameplay style. The main Ensemble Stars! game changed its name to Ensemble Stars!! Basic with the launch. The ""Basic"" app allows players to continue playing the app as they always have. In contrast, the Ensemble Stars!! Music app features a new rhythm game style of gameplay.
