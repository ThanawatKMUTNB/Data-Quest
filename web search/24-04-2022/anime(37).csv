Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision Episode 30  by Christopher Farris, Apr 23rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 30 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.3            It had been a while since we saw them in Die Neue These, so I suppose it only makes sense that we check back in with the Dominion of Fezzan. There are a couple structural things we can take from this week's episode: 1) That as with the past couple entries, things are still deep in an expositional structure setting up the next major plot beats, and 2) that compared to some of the shuffling that had occurred over the previous episodes of Collision thus far, we are firmly back into the territory of 'near-directly recreating episodes of the old OVA'. Part of that's simply an expected consequence of both versions choosing to adapt the same point of the original story in structurally similar ways. It ultimately just drives home how much of the information imparted in this segment is a fundamental backbone for what other parts are to come, even if what's here isn't exactly the most exciting part of the story.    They do try, a little bit. The directorial designs of this episode love using daylight to frame and style the proceedings as our focal characters, Fezzan's current Landhesherr Adrian Rubinksy and his gopher Kesserling, meet with other leadership in dealings we're assured are most sinister. White light pours into the windows behind Kesserling as he manipulates commissioners from both major factions, and things cool down into the oranges of evening as he reconvenes with Rubinsky towards the end of the episode, communicating the passage of time as well as what an average 'day in the life' all this manipulation has encompassed. As well, the music comes off as a simple but strong asset deployed alongside the cinematography, considerably elevating the presentation of all these conversations compared to the overt exposition we got last week.    So beyond those presentational ambitions reminding us that they originally intended us to watch this thing in a theater, what are we getting, content-wise, out of Die Neue These in this entry? Rubinsky makes a remark late in the episode about setting up pieces in plans that may only turn out to be useful much later down the line. LOGH is no stranger to slow-burn schemes, so the plot here is mostly about seeing some of those setups occur. Well, that and indulging more of Yoshiki Tanaka's analyses on the interconnected machinations of conflict throughout history. Hey, did you know organized religion has had a broad role to play in such things?! They've been hinted at in previous stories, but the beginning of this episode has Rubinsky meeting with a Bishop of the Church of Terra, expositing that Fezzan's long history of prolonging the war between the Alliance and the Empire has been at the behest of this organization's beliefs.    There are obviously…fraught implications for a story as densely analytical as LOGH to suggest that the true masterminds of overarching conflicts are an ancient religion and their integrated financial backing. But for what it's worth – as they have in other variations of the series – the Church of Terra here do come off more like a critique of general organized religion and their holds on society, as opposed to secretive villains operating under the guise of a marginalized group. Hell, Rubinsky himself directly compares the group and its influence to Christianity, specifically, so there's not really any concern for conspiracy theories. Besides, the point Rubinsky arrives at by the end of this little chapter is that such notions of understated, belief-based control of the overall masses is an outdated concept for megalomaniacal masterminding, seeking instead to prove that control via economical capital is the modern path forward. It's an interesting meta-concept baked into the broader thematics of LOGH, and like all the players this one introduces, sets the stage with more elements we'll be able to watch unfold (slowly) as the story goes on.    As for said introduced players...well, they sure are introduced! Some are going to be relevant sooner than others, if this adaptation's structure sticks as close to the old versions as it currently seems to be doing, meaning that Alliance Commissioner Henslow and his planted grudge against Yang will be the one to watch for the near future. Though my personal favorite of those we see Kesserling meeting with is probably Remscheid, whose hairdo proves that even with the glossy redesigns Production I.G is deigning to give to much of this cast, they're still committed to several LOGH characters looking stupid as hell. There's also Schumacher and Landsberg, who exist as a solid example of the series' constant commitment to the idea of the threads of stories never fully being finished, representing ongoing remnants of the nobles' coalition from the Empire's previous civil war. Also I just like the framing of the little darkened-room meeting that Kesserling brings them into, and the way the animation portrays the absolute contempt that Schumacher has to bury as he 'looks forward to working' with Landsberg.    Honestly, the most compelling character introduction is arguably the one who doesn't even live past the end of the episode, courtesy of the series spicing things up with a little vehicular manslaughter, as you do. The investigator known as 'Nidhogg' makes clear that the folks of Fezzan aren't the only ones engaging in manipulation, and needing to make sure he couldn't communicate any of his findings to Oberstein acts as a demonstration of how deep Rubinsky and Kesserling's machinations go. The mere suggestion that a platonic rule between Reinhard's order and Yang's leadership could exist hinges on that economic elite singled out as Rubinsky's driving force in this episode. Early in the LOGH story as we technically still are, it presents a theoretically-tempting concept that even new viewers can guess won't be followed up on for some time. But as with all of its introductions of players to be important later, it continues to deliver – with a stronger presentation this week as well – the kind of conceptual intrigue we keep coming back to this story for.

News Manga Plus Adds Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 02:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga debuted in April 2020    Shueisha's MANGA Plus service added Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga on Wednesday. The first four chapters are on the service.    The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact.    Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love is War) and Yokoyari (Scum's Wish) launched the Oshi no Ko (My Stan's Kid) manga in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in April 2020. Shueisha's published the manga's seventh compiled book volume on February 22.    The manga won in the Best General Manga category in the 46th annual Kodansha Manga awards this year. The manga was nominated for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize this year. The manga has also been nominated for the 14th and 15th Manga Taisho Awards. The manga ranked at #7 on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2022 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Akasaka's Kaguya-sama: Love is War manga launched in Shueisha's Miracle Jump magazine in May 2015 but it moved to Young Jump in March 2016. The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in January 2019, as well as a second season that premiered in April 2020. The anime's third season premiered on April 9. The manga also inspired a live-action film that opened in Japan in September 2019. A sequel film opened in August 2021.    Yokoyari's Scum's Wish manga ran in Square Enix's Big Gangan magazine from 2012 until March 2017. Square Enix published eight compiled book volumes for the manga. The manga also received the Scum's Wish décor spinoff manga, which launched in Big Gangan in November 2017, and ended in May 2018. Square Enix shipped a compiled book volume for the manga as the ninth volume of Scum's Wish in July 2018. The manga inspired both a television anime series and a live-action series, which ran in parallel beginning in January 2017. Both series adapted the entire story of the manga.

News Manga Plus Adds Aka Akasaka, Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko Manga   posted on 2022-04-22 02:04 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Manga debuted in April 2020    Shueisha's MANGA Plus service added Aka Akasaka and Mengo Yokoyari's Oshi no Ko manga on Wednesday. The first four chapters are on the service.    The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact.    Akasaka (Kaguya-sama: Love is War) and Yokoyari (Scum's Wish) launched the Oshi no Ko (My Stan's Kid) manga in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine in April 2020. Shueisha's published the manga's seventh compiled book volume on February 22.    The manga won in the Best General Manga category in the 46th annual Kodansha Manga awards this year. The manga was nominated for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize this year. The manga has also been nominated for the 14th and 15th Manga Taisho Awards. The manga ranked at #7 on the top 20 list of manga for male readers in the 2022 edition of Takarajimasha's Kono Manga ga Sugoi! (This Manga Is Amazing!) guidebook.    Akasaka's Kaguya-sama: Love is War manga launched in Shueisha's Miracle Jump magazine in May 2015 but it moved to Young Jump in March 2016. The manga inspired a television anime that premiered in January 2019, as well as a second season that premiered in April 2020. The anime's third season premiered on April 9. The manga also inspired a live-action film that opened in Japan in September 2019. A sequel film opened in August 2021.    Yokoyari's Scum's Wish manga ran in Square Enix's Big Gangan magazine from 2012 until March 2017. Square Enix published eight compiled book volumes for the manga. The manga also received the Scum's Wish décor spinoff manga, which launched in Big Gangan in November 2017, and ended in May 2018. Square Enix shipped a compiled book volume for the manga as the ninth volume of Scum's Wish in July 2018.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost ?                     Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to.

Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.    Mostly that's because I felt a bit talked down to by the episode. Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring.

Our protagonist, Fushihara, is being overworked by her boss when a baby ghost (or a ghost baby) starts telling her to leave the building. The ghost is just concerned for Fushihara's well-being, and also thinks she's paying the woman back for the “offerings” of onigiri; meanwhile we know that Fushihara and the other workers have been wondering who keeps stealing their lunches. It's almost too deliberately adorable to actually be cute, and there's a real sense that we're being hit over the head with things that we're meant to find warm and fuzzy without them being that way naturally. Things like the baby ghost laying out a futon for Fushihara and then falling asleep in it herself reek of the sort of manufactured little kid behavior that not many real kids exhibit, as if the ghost was written by someone with an academic idea of toddlers without ever having interacted with one.    Of course, it's a show about a ghost (and a nekomata, a fox, an oni, and a teeny tiny maid, if the opening theme is to be believed), so realism isn't necessarily something it needs to adhere to. But the saccharine nature of the episode is just off-putting, to say nothing of the uneven nature of the storytelling, which relies on both the baby's cuteness and hopping back and forth in time, neither of which quite work. I'm probably being too nitpicky here, but all the manufactured sweetness in the world couldn't quite hold my attention with this one.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               Whenever we get one of these shows, I can't help but feel kind of depressed about the whole thing. They're not super common, but the past few years we seem to always get at least one of these “soothing” comedies about a criminally overworked office worker getting some supernatural assistance from a cute little spirit creature. But it's never in helping the lead character find a new job or learning to value themselves enough to not work themselves into an early grave – the spirit is always just there to offer some basic comfort and support to make the rise & grind slightly more bearable. That's a premise that just can't be very fun, especially not with a show as slow-paced and repetitive as this premiere.    Because “slow” is the word for this entire episode. Jokes come with the speed of a sleepy tortoise, extending the setup for every gag well past the breaking point, for a punchline that nearly always amounts to “aww, isn't this lil ghost girl just pwecious” and little else. And that's before we get into the back half of the episode, which is just a retelling of the previous events from said ghost girl's perspective, and adds very little besides a couple of equally dull gags. In total it feels like a premiere that was planned to be an 8-minute short, and had to suddenly scramble to fill 20 at the last minute. That belabored timing pretty much strangles any chance of comedic timing even if the jokes were conceptually hilarious.    So we're left with a show that's depressing when it means to be heartwarming, and either boring or annoying when it's meant to be funny. That's a certified death knell for any show, and especially one as slight as Little Baby Ghost. I don't think I'll ever find one of these shows endearing – something about getting a fairy sidekick to make 18-hour workdays slightly less soul annihilating just tastes like ash in my mouth – but this one is far from exemplary.     discuss this in the forum (300 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.4              What is this?   Fushihara is a woman who is a ""slave"" to her company. She meets Yūrei, the ghost girl who wants to help her.    Shachiku-san wa Yо̄jo Yuurei ni Iyasaretai. is based on Imari Arita's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                So, here's the question of the day for you all. Does this episode—and perhaps the entire anime—count as a dead baby joke? Because I've been wondering that since the moment I started watching.    This episode is built around the joke that working at your average Japanese company is more terrifying than ghosts. Shachiku is a hard worker and is thus exploited by her lazy boss who forces her to do all the work he can't be bothered with. This results in late nights working all alone. And even when faced with a supernatural being coming to kill her, she simply works on. Or to put it another way, it's only a matter of time until she wakes up reincarnated in another world.    Enter our innocent baby ghost. She doesn't want Shachiku to die and is hoping to find a way to help her. Of course, the best help would be forcing Shachiku to go home and sleep, but when that fails, our little ghost turns to massages, tea breaks, and loving hugs to help the overworked woman power through. It's all very cute—but that's not enough to keep the episode interesting.    This is made worse by how the episode is directed. We see the same scenes (lunch time and Shachiku's first encounter with the ghost) several times. Sure, sometimes it's from Shachiku's point of view and sometimes it's from the ghosts—and sometimes it confusingly switches between them in the same scene. It gets repetitive and boring. And honestly, I found the show more depressing than funny or cute due to the premise alone. Overwork is still a serious issue here and I've seen more than a few friends overworked into depression.    In the end, this show lives or dies on how much you enjoy the cuteness overload of the baby ghost. If that's your cup of tea, you'll be just fine watching it. If you need more than cuteness in your anime, however, you might want to pass on this one.      Caitlin Moore  Rating:                If I were to describe Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost in a single word, it would be “cloying.” If reviews have to be more than one word, I would calling it cloying, mawkish, saccharine, treacly, twee, sickly sweet, maudlin, insipid, and akin to chugging a gallon bottle of liquid sucralose. It has no flavor profile beyond sweet, no interests beyond making you say, “Dawwww, how pwecioush,” if you're not barfing in the corner from being force fed a pound of aspartame. You notice how I'm only comparing it to artificial sweeteners? That's because there's not a single real thing about this.    In case you're new here, hi, I'm Caitlin and I work in early childhood education with children from the ages of six months to three years. I have an extremely limited tolerance for fictional children that don't act even remotely like real children, and I gotta say, the baby ghost resembles a real toddler about as much as a maltipoo resembles a wolf. She exists to be cute and emotionally support Fushihara as she works late into the night upon the orders of her asshole boss, and really nothing else. Real children are to her as what biblical angels are to those naked cherub paintings they sell in Christian tchotchke shops.    This is ostensibly a comedy, but every punchline consists of, “The baby ghost does something and it's cute!” It lingers on her teary eyes, her tiny pigeon-toed feet, her blobby little hands, but it doesn't take much to realize that there was never an actual joke. The humor doesn't land so much as squirm about slowly about like those slugs that keep eating my goddamn pansies and sorry, what were we talking about again? Miss Shachiku is so agonizingly boring that my mind keeps sliding away from it like a slug sliding across the dirt to get to my pansies oops it happened again. Better wrap this up.    Don't watch Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost if you like kids. Stay away if you have even the slightest concept of what makes young children funny and weird and infuriating and a joy to spend time with. Skip it if you see children for what they are, as small humans learning about the ways the world works and also happen to act like tiny drunk adults most of the time.      James Beckett  Rating:                Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is one of those anime that we seem to get one or two of every season that forces me to ask one very simple question: “Why the hell wasn't this thing a short?” Within just the first couple of minutes, I was already worried that I wouldn't jive with this comedy's particular focus on overbearing cutesy-poo fluff, but when I saw that the episode was a full half-hour, my heart sank. And I hadn't even gotten to the second half of the premiere yet.    The main issue with Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost is that it isn't funny. At all. It doesn't even really have proper jokes, outside of the recurring bit where the titular ghost implores the titular Miss Shachiku to go home and sleep, rather than be worked to death, and Fushihara refuses because she wants to gush over how cute the ghost is. That's it. That's the whole premise. Every other potential joke is ruined by the episode's horrid pacing. There's certainly comedy to be mined from satirizing Japan's hostile workplace culture, dark as it may be, but Miss Shachiku seems content to have the little ghost make a bunch of baby noises for an interminably long time while its overworked protagonist gleefully rides the Overtime Monorail into an early grave.    Also—and this may be my leftover hangover from Heroines Run the School talking—we need to have a conversation about these shows that try to get away with forcing their voice actresses to make the most insufferable toddler sounds imaginable for thirty minutes straight and passing it off as comedy. I'm not going to pretend that I was jazzed about the core concept of the baby ghost to begin with, since I was turned off from the moment that I realized that the subtitles were going to have her say things like “Pwease” for the whole show. Outside of the ghost's voice and mannerisms, though, there was nothing outright offensive or unbearable about Miss Shachiku. It was mostly just slow and unfunny, which I could tolerate for a few minutes.    Then the second half of the episode kicked in, in which we see the events of the first half of the episode from the ghost's perspective, and all of it was so utterly pointless and unnecessary that I actually started getting mad. Did we need to really need to watch the ghost putter about and talk to herself about things that we already saw her say and do in the previous half? The gag of the ghost using a little speaker to sound scary was the closest that the opening came to a decent joke; did the show really need to kill it by overexplaining where she got it and how she decided to use it? Did somebody on the production committee just want to play a cruel prank on project No.9 by forcing the staff to animate four times as much as they needed to for this thing, and then they decided to keep it all in the show to add insult to injury?    I don't know. All I know is that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost was the exact opposite of a good time, for me. There are better slice-of-life anime, better workplace comedies, and better ghost stories out there to have fun with. Don't let this one haunt your Spring Season.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                I almost feel badly about giving this show such a low rating, because it's clearly trying its hardest. There's a sort of earnestness about the whole thing that ought to make it more appealing than it is, a sort of well-meaning cuteness that's clearly intended to soothe the tired soul. But there's a fine line between “soothing” and “boring,” and I'm afraid that Miss Shachiku and the Little Baby Ghost crosses it with wild abandon, trying its best to be as charming as possible without actually understanding what makes something sweet.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          31 comments       ONIMAI: I'm Now Your Sister!

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.

Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ingram-73542921/': 1}"

Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?

Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century.

Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name.

So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Spy×Family Episodes 1-2  by Rebecca Silverman, Apr 19th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes. The moment Anya appears in the first she steals the show away, and the second focuses much more on Yor. We do see Twilight carry out a couple of missions with great aplomb across both episodes, and his thoughts are needed so that we can have Anya's reactions to them, but the character development is in large part given to the ladies. In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

In the case of Anya, this allows for us to develop an attachment to someone in the story, because she is far and away the most sympathetic person in it. Her past is unrelentingly bleak – by the age of five or six, she's already been through a form of hell and until Loid walked into the orphanage, she saw no reason to hope that it would ever change. Therefore, helping her new dad is a major fixation for her, or at least as much as it can be to such a little kid; one of the show's great strengths here is that it doesn't try to make Anya anything other than a very small child doing her best to understand and work with what's around her. She doesn't interpret anything in a way too mature for her years; she's just a regular kid with an added ability to read minds, meaning that most of her reactions feel very real. She's afraid to jeopardize her awesome new life, but she's also slowly feeling more secure in it, and that's a very nice balance to strike while still allowing for plenty of humor.    Yor, on the other hand, is very much stuck between a social rock and a professional hard place. At her day job, she's ridiculed by what has to be the worst group of coworkers in anime for being single because she doesn't conform to their catty expectations of having a boyfriend or a husband. She needs the day job to cover up her assassin gig, but that very assassin job means that she can't live up to what's expected of a woman in the mid-twentieth century. Loid seems like the perfect cover: he's handsome, he has a good (fake) job as a psychiatrist, and he seems to find her attractive. (Plus he's got the perfect wingman in Anya.) And since he needs a wife to meet the school's requirements…    Production-wise, this is also doing a bang-up job. The use of light and dark is very well done, which is important to contrast the gritty world the story is set in with the fluffier aspects of the story, like poor Loid's stress over how having a kid turns out to be a little more involved than he anticipated and Anya's perceptions versus reality. (And just Franky in general.) Action scenes go between slick animation and goofy repetition, which also works well, and it's interesting to note that the art doesn't take two opportunities to show us Yor's underwear, which I appreciate. So far I'm also loving the voices, and if I'm not sold on the opening song itself, the visuals definitely make up for the time it will take for the music to inevitably grow on me.    Simply put? “Playing happy families” has never looked so fun.    Rating:                 Spy×Family is currently streaming on Crunchyroll.

Community score: 4.7                  How would you rate episode 2 of Spy×Family ?                     Community score: 4.8            It is the dark days of the Cold War, in a country that's totally not the divided Germany of the mid-twentieth century. Spies are everywhere, and chief among them is Twilight, the man who takes on the most dangerous missions with a high rate of success. Now, in these grim days on history's dark side, Twilight is about to begin his most alarming mission yet: adopting a daughter and getting married.    Welcome to SPY x FAMILY, a show whose title basically says it all – it's a spy caper crossed with a family comedy and an adaptation of the manga of the same name. Naturally, Twilight's mission isn't just to create a family, either; it's more that a family will be necessary for him to infiltrate the social circles of his latest target – a Mr. Desmond who basically only socializes with the people at the prestigious Eden Academy (or College, as it's called in episode two). So if Twilight is going to break into his social whirl, he's going to need a kid to send to the fancy school, and like the old mouse with a cookie, he's going to need a wife to meet the strict societal expectations of the mid-century world he lives in. For a single, elite spy, that's way out of his wheelhouse, which is absolutely to our benefit as consumers of his story.    Twilight, who takes on the name “Loid Forger,” (which is roughly as subtle as “Jedrington Secret-Past” in The Bleak Old Shop of Stuff) may be an amazing spy, but he's not so great at figuring out who people really are, which makes for an entertaining disconnect when he heads to the shadiest orphanage he can find and walks out with Anya, a pint-sized psychic, and then in episode two ends up courting Yor, a highly-accomplished assassin. Whether or not this turns out to be incredibly lucky for him remains to be seen, but it absolutely makes one thing clear: Anya, as manga readers already know, is the beating heart of this story. Loid is fully unaware of the fact that she's got ESP (a result of being experimented on), and Anya's powers mean that she's the only person in the entire story who knows everything that's going on. She not only uses her skills to get Loid to adopt her in the first place, but she also knows that he's a spy – and when she overhears Yor thinking about her side-job as an assassin, she doesn't exactly share that info with her new dad; mostly because she both knows he needs to find a (fake) wife, but also because the idea of a spy married to an assassin and both of them being her parents is unbearably awesome in her mind. Going from orphan to daughter of a top-secret couple with secret missions? Yes, please!    Despite the story nominally being about Twilight/Loid and his mission (code named: Operation Strix), he's actually a bit in the background of both of these episodes.

I am a huge fan of this series and can't wait to see what happens next, but the most important thing is the author's health - mental and physical.   It is so disheartening to hear that many mangakas suffer from health issues due to meeting insane deadlines and that it seems to just be a normal thing.   As a manga fan, i would rather wait longer for a work to come out if it meant the authors could prioritze their health.

I am a huge fan of this series and can't wait to see what happens next, but the most important thing is the author's health - mental and physical.   It is so disheartening to hear that many mangakas suffer from health issues due to meeting insane deadlines and that it seems to just be a normal thing.   As a manga fan, i would rather wait longer for a work to come out if it meant the authors could prioritze their health.

News 'Play It Cool, Guys' Anime to Air for Half Year With 15-Minute Episodes   posted on 2022-04-23 14:32 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Series to premiere in October    Manga creator Kokone Nata revealed on Twitter on Friday that the television anime adaptation of their Play It Cool, Guys (Cool Doji Danshi) manga will air for two cours (quarter of a year) with each episode being 15 minutes long.    The anime premiere in October, and will star:    Chiaki Kobayashi as Hayate Ichihara   Kouki Uchiyama as Shun Futami   Yuichiro Umehara as Takayuki Mima   Shōya Chiba as Sōma Shiki    Chiaki Kon (Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal: Season III, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal, The Way of the Househusband, Junjō Romantica) is directing the anime at Studio Pierrot. Makoto Uezu (Assassination Classroom, Yuki Yuna Is a Hero, Space Brothers) is overseeing the series scripts, and Airi Taguchi (key animation for Children of the Sea, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? second season) is serving as both character designer and chief animation director. Masato Nakayama (B-PROJECT, We Never Learn: BOKUBEN, You and Me.) is composing the music.    Yen Press is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Enter: a bunch of cool guys who look like they got that unapproachable swag. But let's be real—that's not the true them. They're just a bunch of dorks who've got the act down pat. So sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching a bunch of goofy guys try to look cool all day every day. Play It Cool, Guys is a fun collection of stories featuring guys that are equal parts cool and equal parts adorably awkward.   Yen Press is publishing the manga in full color, as it was originally released in Japan. Nata launched the manga in June 2019 on the Gangan pixiv website, where it is ongoing.

News 'Play It Cool, Guys' Anime to Air for Half Year With 15-Minute Episodes   posted on 2022-04-23 14:32 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Series to premiere in October    Manga creator Kokone Nata revealed on Twitter on Friday that the television anime adaptation of their Play It Cool, Guys (Cool Doji Danshi) manga will air for two cours (quarter of a year) with each episode being 15 minutes long.    The anime premiere in October, and will star:    Chiaki Kobayashi as Hayate Ichihara   Kouki Uchiyama as Shun Futami   Yuichiro Umehara as Takayuki Mima   Shōya Chiba as Sōma Shiki    Chiaki Kon (Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal: Season III, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal, The Way of the Househusband, Junjō Romantica) is directing the anime at Studio Pierrot. Makoto Uezu (Assassination Classroom, Yuki Yuna Is a Hero, Space Brothers) is overseeing the series scripts, and Airi Taguchi (key animation for Children of the Sea, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? second season) is serving as both character designer and chief animation director. Masato Nakayama (B-PROJECT, We Never Learn: BOKUBEN, You and Me.) is composing the music.    Yen Press is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Enter: a bunch of cool guys who look like they got that unapproachable swag. But let's be real—that's not the true them. They're just a bunch of dorks who've got the act down pat. So sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching a bunch of goofy guys try to look cool all day every day. Play It Cool, Guys is a fun collection of stories featuring guys that are equal parts cool and equal parts adorably awkward.   Yen Press is publishing the manga in full color, as it was originally released in Japan. Nata launched the manga in June 2019 on the Gangan pixiv website, where it is ongoing.

The anime premiere in October, and will star:    Chiaki Kobayashi as Hayate Ichihara   Kouki Uchiyama as Shun Futami   Yuichiro Umehara as Takayuki Mima   Shōya Chiba as Sōma Shiki    Chiaki Kon (Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Crystal: Season III, Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal, The Way of the Househusband, Junjō Romantica) is directing the anime at Studio Pierrot. Makoto Uezu (Assassination Classroom, Yuki Yuna Is a Hero, Space Brothers) is overseeing the series scripts, and Airi Taguchi (key animation for Children of the Sea, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? second season) is serving as both character designer and chief animation director. Masato Nakayama (B-PROJECT, We Never Learn: BOKUBEN, You and Me.) is composing the music.    Yen Press is releasing the manga in English, and it describes the story:   Enter: a bunch of cool guys who look like they got that unapproachable swag. But let's be real—that's not the true them. They're just a bunch of dorks who've got the act down pat. So sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy watching a bunch of goofy guys try to look cool all day every day. Play It Cool, Guys is a fun collection of stories featuring guys that are equal parts cool and equal parts adorably awkward.

It's simple, but it summons up imagery of fantasy worlds and distant deserts, deep green forests and strange cultures.

Co-author Shaenon Garrity counts down her favorite manga from the column. ―  Shaenon's Ten Favorite 'House' Manga It falls upon my bowed shoulders to announce the news: House of 1,000 Manga is ending.

House of 1000 Manga is due in four hours, and I've read everything in the house.

Shaenon investigates. ―  The Earl and the Fairy I admit it: I feel like I'm behind on the shojo manga these days. The most popular shonen series make enough noise in fandom that even an old Dirty Pair-reading fart like myself knows more or less what's up, and anyway right now it's mostly Attack on Titan ...                    column          10 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Poverty, Princesses and Zombies   2015 May  8, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    Jason checks out three prose novels about the life and challenges of working as a mangaka. ―  The Poverty, The Princess and the Zombies The way reading about food makes you hungry, reading about manga makes me want to read manga.

I wish Tatsumi, who passed away earlier this year, could have drawn a sequel about the second half of his career, during which he b...                    column          9 comments       House of 1000 Manga - Kakukaku Shikajika   2015 Apr 24, 00:00 9 comments                 manga    If you were ever curious what life was like for the woman who created Princess Jellyfish, Jason has the manga for you. ―  Kakukaku Shikajika “I want to go back in time and beat up that moron.” —Akiko Higashimura, and many other artists, talking about their younger self Few artists “live the dream” of becoming a professional when they're still a teenager.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It isn't even worth looking at the theater list with anyone else.         It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness.

Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

It would be nice if they could expand further but you have to have realistic expectations that Belle is a major stand alone studio film by a prominent film director while Revue Starlight is a sequel to a niche surrealist anime that didn't exactly set the streaming world on fire when it came out.  It's amazing it's being released in US theaters at all.  And you also have to take into account GKids is a much bigger company with more money and resources than Sentai.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.

I'm listening to the movie OST right now and I'm pretty sure it's my favourite 'anime series' movie, ever. It addressed character tensions established and exploited by the show, handled an oversight regarding one particular stage girl not getting her moment, and it evolved all the themes to a level of surreal extravagance expected of a student of the Ikuhara school of WTFness. And unlike a lot of anime series movies, it didn't really have 'stand out sakuga' moments between tv-level production scenes -- the whole thing was gorgeous.   Unfortunately it does sort of rely on having seen the recap movie (or at least what it does differently near the end) but, much like Heaven's Feel 1, this is one of those movies of such superior quality that you want to recommend to ANYONE who likes anime, 'getting it all' be damned.
