News Sentai Filmworks Screens Revue Starlight Anime Film in June With Early May Premiere at Anime Central   posted on 2022-04-22 02:41 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime screens in N. America on June 5-6    Sentai Filmworks announced on Thursday that it will screen Revue Starlight The Movie, the new anime film for the Shōjo Kageki Revue Starlight franchise, in North American theaters in June following an early premiere at the Anime Central convention in Rosemont, Illinois on May 20 at 8:00 p.m. The movie will screen in select theaters on June 5 with an encore presentation on June 6. The company streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      Sentai Filmworks describes the story:   Revue Starlight The Movie picks up soon after the series left off and opens the curtain a new, original story set during Karen Aijo and Hikari Kagura's third year at Seisho Music Academy, a performing arts school for young women who aspire to the heights of on-stage stardom. In the next chapter of their theatrical lives, these young women will face one another on the battlefield of the stage, where song, dance and thrilling swordplay collide to illustrate the rich emotional narratives of the film's protagonists.  The film was previously slated to open in Japan in May 2021, but was delayed to June 2021 due to the state of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting temporary closure of some theaters.    The Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Rondo Rondo Rondo compilation film opened in August 2020. The film was first slated to open in May 2020, but was postponed due to the spread of COVID-19. The new film continues the story of the compilation film.    Bushiroad announced the franchise in April 2017 with a stage musical and television anime project. The musical Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight The LIVE, billed as a  ""2.5 dimension musical and live concert,"" ran in Tokyo in September 2017. The 12-episode television anime series premiered in July 2018. Sentai Filmworks streamed the series on HIDIVE with English subtitles and an English dub. The franchise also inspired a new mini anime titled Shōjo☆Konto All Starlight (Girl Comedy Skit All Starlight), which premiered in July 2019.    Sora Goto and Kanata Nakamura launched Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Overture, the first manga for the franchise, in Kadokawa's Dengeki G's Comic magazine in January 2018, and ended it in October 2018. The franchise also includes the Butai Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight ―The LIVE― SHOW MUST GO ON and Yonkoma Starlight manga.    Ateam's Revue Starlight Re LIVE smartphone game launched worldwide in April 2019. A third stage musical production was slated for July 2020, but was delayed to July 2021 due to COVID-19.

News Sentai Filmworks Screens Revue Starlight Anime Film in June With Early May Premiere at Anime Central   posted on 2022-04-22 02:41 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         Anime screens in N. America on June 5-6    Sentai Filmworks announced on Thursday that it will screen Revue Starlight The Movie, the new anime film for the Shōjo Kageki Revue Starlight franchise, in North American theaters in June following an early premiere at the Anime Central convention in Rosemont, Illinois on May 20 at 8:00 p.m. The movie will screen in select theaters on June 5 with an encore presentation on June 6. The company streamed an English-subtitled trailer:      Sentai Filmworks describes the story:   Revue Starlight The Movie picks up soon after the series left off and opens the curtain a new, original story set during Karen Aijo and Hikari Kagura's third year at Seisho Music Academy, a performing arts school for young women who aspire to the heights of on-stage stardom. In the next chapter of their theatrical lives, these young women will face one another on the battlefield of the stage, where song, dance and thrilling swordplay collide to illustrate the rich emotional narratives of the film's protagonists.  The film was previously slated to open in Japan in May 2021, but was delayed to June 2021 due to the state of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the resulting temporary closure of some theaters.    The Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Rondo Rondo Rondo compilation film opened in August 2020. The film was first slated to open in May 2020, but was postponed due to the spread of COVID-19. The new film continues the story of the compilation film.    Bushiroad announced the franchise in April 2017 with a stage musical and television anime project. The musical Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight The LIVE, billed as a  ""2.5 dimension musical and live concert,"" ran in Tokyo in September 2017. The 12-episode television anime series premiered in July 2018. Sentai Filmworks streamed the series on HIDIVE with English subtitles and an English dub. The franchise also inspired a new mini anime titled Shōjo☆Konto All Starlight (Girl Comedy Skit All Starlight), which premiered in July 2019.    Sora Goto and Kanata Nakamura launched Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight Overture, the first manga for the franchise, in Kadokawa's Dengeki G's Comic magazine in January 2018, and ended it in October 2018. The franchise also includes the Butai Shōjo☆Kageki Revue Starlight ―The LIVE― SHOW MUST GO ON and Yonkoma Starlight manga.    Ateam's Revue Starlight Re LIVE smartphone game launched worldwide in April 2019. A third stage musical production was slated for July 2020, but was delayed to July 2021 due to COVID-19.

I am a huge fan of this series and can't wait to see what happens next, but the most important thing is the author's health - mental and physical.

News Galaxy Express 999 Another Story: Ultimate Journey Manga Enters Final Arc   posted on 2022-04-21 06:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Yuzuru Shimazaki's retelling of Leiji Matsumoto's original manga launched in 2018    The June issue of Akita Shoten's Champion RED magazine revealed on Tuesday that Yuzuru Shimazaki's Ginga Tetsudo 999 Another Story: Ultimate Journey (Galaxy Express 999 Another Story: Ultimate Journey) manga is entering its final arc.    In addition, the magazine revealed that the manga will skip the next issue on May 19, and will return in the August issue in June.    The manga retells the story of Leiji Matsumoto's Galaxy Express 999 original manga. The story of the anime and manga follows a young orphan named Tetsuro as he travels with a mysterious woman named Maetel through the galaxy on a space train, in the hopes of obtaining a cybernetic body. The train stops at many planets along the way, often leading to adventures for the two.    Shimazaki launched the manga in Champion RED in March 2018. Matsumoto is credited with the original work, setting, and design for the manga, and Shimazaki is drawing the new series. Akita Shoten published the manga's seventh compiled book volume in September 2021.    Shimazaki previously drew a reboot manga of Matsumoto's Gun Frontier manga.    The 113-episode television anime series aired from 1978-1981. An anime film alternate retelling premiered in 1979. The franchise then spawned multiple other movies, specials, and OVAs. The original 18-volume manga ran from 1977-1981.

News Galaxy Express 999 Another Story: Ultimate Journey Manga Enters Final Arc   posted on 2022-04-21 06:00 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Yuzuru Shimazaki's retelling of Leiji Matsumoto's original manga launched in 2018    The June issue of Akita Shoten's Champion RED magazine revealed on Tuesday that Yuzuru Shimazaki's Ginga Tetsudo 999 Another Story: Ultimate Journey (Galaxy Express 999 Another Story: Ultimate Journey) manga is entering its final arc.    In addition, the magazine revealed that the manga will skip the next issue on May 19, and will return in the August issue in June.    The manga retells the story of Leiji Matsumoto's Galaxy Express 999 original manga. The story of the anime and manga follows a young orphan named Tetsuro as he travels with a mysterious woman named Maetel through the galaxy on a space train, in the hopes of obtaining a cybernetic body. The train stops at many planets along the way, often leading to adventures for the two.    Shimazaki launched the manga in Champion RED in March 2018. Matsumoto is credited with the original work, setting, and design for the manga, and Shimazaki is drawing the new series. Akita Shoten published the manga's seventh compiled book volume in September 2021.    Shimazaki previously drew a reboot manga of Matsumoto's Gun Frontier manga.    The 113-episode television anime series aired from 1978-1981. An anime film alternate retelling premiered in 1979. The franchise then spawned multiple other movies, specials, and OVAs. The original 18-volume manga ran from 1977-1981.

Backlog dub (started airing Fall 2021) that was out-sourced to NYAV Post, so unfortunately not much of a change regarding what CR intends to do in-studio.   I will say I do typically love NYAV Post as a studio (even though the director is super new to directing solo), but man it feels like CR/Funi always gives them the short end of the stick when it comes to projects compared to Sound Cadence or even Kocha. The majority of shows they get usually seem very average at best       Back to top                  Sevokevo Royuki    Joined: 15 Jul 2012 		    Posts: 182 		    Location: Texas 		        Posted: Fri Apr 22, 2022 8:53 pm              AceLuffy4Ever wrote:    Why is everything getting a premiere except for Rise of the Shield hero Dub            Season 2 was confirmed to get the dub.. so be patient… that’s all we can do…      Back to top                   loveliver    Joined: 26 Nov 2014 		    Posts: 121       Posted: Fri Apr 22, 2022 9:48 pm              AceLuffy4Ever wrote:    Why is everything getting a premiere except for Rise of the Shield hero Dub            Season 1 was done at Bang Zoom! and Season 2 will be done there too.

Apparently Billy Kametz is also not feeling well (he canceled a convention appearance and the Tokyo 24th Ward dub has been delayed), so that might delay the dubs for Shield Hero season 2 and Science Fell in Love season 2 (although I would think he would have recorded the last two episodes of 86 by now).

Backlog dub (started airing Fall 2021) that was out-sourced to NYAV Post, so unfortunately not much of a change regarding what CR intends to do in-studio.   I will say I do typically love NYAV Post as a studio (even though the director is super new to directing solo), but man it feels like CR/Funi always gives them the short end of the stick when it comes to projects compared to Sound Cadence or even Kocha.

Apparently Billy Kametz is also not feeling well (he canceled a convention appearance and the Tokyo 24th Ward dub has been delayed), so that might delay the dubs for Shield Hero season 2 and Science Fell in Love season 2 (although I would think he would have recorded the last two episodes of 86 by now).
