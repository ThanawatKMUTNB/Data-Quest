I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

I think the red knight didn't feel as dangerous as it was in the LN but that's a minor quibble. From the opening and the pacing, it looks like the anime will adapt until Volume 2. I'm really excited to see how the anime will depict spoiler[Akari's real personality].

Dead Detective did its best, but the production values and plotting crumpled; fingers crossed this one goes the distance.  Presumably Akari will be something other than Nice, Existent, and Increasingly Down Bad once she gets shipped off to church.     Menou and Momo are great, though.  Especially poor Momo, doomed to lose to BSS.

I interpreted the train-wreck scene at the end as the explanation for the time-stutter in the fight with the Red Knight (and the ""simultaneous"" scene between Momo and the Princess) --- that was the moment Akari reset the timeline to.     Quote:    And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.            Given that I think Menou's vision provides an explanation for the time-stutter earlier in the episode, I interpret it as a memory of the original timeline.

So looking at this one as a must see to the end.  I wonder if the anime adaptation will beat out the english light novels.   About Menou, while the anime shows her killing someone who probably deserves to die, we must remember spoiler[she and her group kill everyone who has that power/skill.  Guilt or innocence doesn't matter.  People who want to have normal lives within soceity and don't use their power/skill, are still hunted down and killed.  If you have been isekai'd, they will search for you, and they will kill you.  So even if you choose to be a good person and not use your power, you will still be killed.]  So Menou is a problematic character.  You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.

It seems that Beckett has a real disdain towards the target audience - or at least what that audience likes and why - and will not be objective.            And I propose that he should be allowed to review whatever he wants, which I imagine will continue to happen. I've been following ANN for a while, and considering he really liked JJK (way more than I did), did super in-depth adoring reviews on AoT (which personally just allowed me to see that the show was continuing not to be my thing at all but I admired his passion) and his criticisms of Demon Slayer were pretty mild, it's just that fanbase is ridiculous, I never got the impression he doesn't like shonen or doesn't fall into its audience at all. And he's suited just fine for this series, as the reason people are interested in THIS show is because it's offering a bit of a twist on the isekai premise, and that seems to be what he was hooked by as well. This review focused on whether the show itself held together beyond that initial hook, and offered a fair assessment.   And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

Funny how, from what I'm seeing, the critics are liking this more than the fans. Perhaps seeing their precious self-insert potato-kun get a murder done on him was triggering.

Quite aside from the obviously ominous name of ""Archbishop Orwell"" and the fact that any time a western church (i.e. Catholic/Anglican in its structure and iconography) is depicted in anime they're generally bad news. There's a whole pile of secrets awaiting us (and, by the looks of things, Menou) there. I think the fact that Menou will have her faith in the church challenged is fairly obvious. It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great. The bubbly crushing-on-Menou personality is plenty fun, but could outstay its welcome fairly easily.   Enjoying this so far, and there's plenty of promise.

I'm enjoying it so far, but not interested in seeing the usual tropes, so fingers crossed   Stopping the train that way was odd. The engine was going full tilt, but instead of shutting off the engine, they just slowed the train by using a magic net (which, at that speed, probably would have caused the middle and rear cars of the train to derail at best (unless all the cars were also slowed by the magic?)) and somehow that caused it to turn off?      zensunni wrote:      And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode.

I'm guessing those two moments are for the same event and are proof that time was rewound from the wreck we see at the end of the episode back to that point.

I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.

And I propose that he should be allowed to review whatever he wants, which I imagine will continue to happen. I've been following ANN for a while, and considering he really liked JJK (way more than I did), did super in-depth adoring reviews on AoT (which personally just allowed me to see that the show was continuing not to be my thing at all but I admired his passion) and his criticisms of Demon Slayer were pretty mild, it's just that fanbase is ridiculous, I never got the impression he doesn't like shonen or doesn't fall into its audience at all. And he's suited just fine for this series, as the reason people are interested in THIS show is because it's offering a bit of a twist on the isekai premise, and that seems to be what he was hooked by as well. This review focused on whether the show itself held together beyond that initial hook, and offered a fair assessment.   And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

Funny how, from what I'm seeing, the critics are liking this more than the fans. Perhaps seeing their precious self-insert potato-kun get a murder done on him was triggering.

Quite aside from the obviously ominous name of ""Archbishop Orwell"" and the fact that any time a western church (i.e. Catholic/Anglican in its structure and iconography) is depicted in anime they're generally bad news. There's a whole pile of secrets awaiting us (and, by the looks of things, Menou) there. I think the fact that Menou will have her faith in the church challenged is fairly obvious. It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great. The bubbly crushing-on-Menou personality is plenty fun, but could outstay its welcome fairly easily.   Enjoying this so far, and there's plenty of promise.

I'm enjoying it so far, but not interested in seeing the usual tropes, so fingers crossed   Stopping the train that way was odd. The engine was going full tilt, but instead of shutting off the engine, they just slowed the train by using a magic net (which, at that speed, probably would have caused the middle and rear cars of the train to derail at best (unless all the cars were also slowed by the magic?)) and somehow that caused it to turn off?      zensunni wrote:      And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode.

I'm guessing those two moments are for the same event and are proof that time was rewound from the wreck we see at the end of the episode back to that point.

I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great.

You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.            I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

I think the red knight didn't feel as dangerous as it was in the LN but that's a minor quibble. From the opening and the pacing, it looks like the anime will adapt until Volume 2. I'm really excited to see how the anime will depict spoiler[Akari's real personality].

Dead Detective did its best, but the production values and plotting crumpled; fingers crossed this one goes the distance.  Presumably Akari will be something other than Nice, Existent, and Increasingly Down Bad once she gets shipped off to church.     Menou and Momo are great, though.  Especially poor Momo, doomed to lose to BSS.

If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.            Given that I think Menou's vision provides an explanation for the time-stutter earlier in the episode, I interpret it as a memory of the original timeline.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.

For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going.

Quite aside from the obviously ominous name of ""Archbishop Orwell"" and the fact that any time a western church (i.e. Catholic/Anglican in its structure and iconography) is depicted in anime they're generally bad news. There's a whole pile of secrets awaiting us (and, by the looks of things, Menou) there. I think the fact that Menou will have her faith in the church challenged is fairly obvious. It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great. The bubbly crushing-on-Menou personality is plenty fun, but could outstay its welcome fairly easily.   Enjoying this so far, and there's plenty of promise.

I'm enjoying it so far, but not interested in seeing the usual tropes, so fingers crossed   Stopping the train that way was odd. The engine was going full tilt, but instead of shutting off the engine, they just slowed the train by using a magic net (which, at that speed, probably would have caused the middle and rear cars of the train to derail at best (unless all the cars were also slowed by the magic?)) and somehow that caused it to turn off?      zensunni wrote:      And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode.

I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.            I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

Dead Detective did its best, but the production values and plotting crumpled; fingers crossed this one goes the distance.  Presumably Akari will be something other than Nice, Existent, and Increasingly Down Bad once she gets shipped off to church.     Menou and Momo are great, though.  Especially poor Momo, doomed to lose to BSS.

It seems that Beckett has a real disdain towards the target audience - or at least what that audience likes and why - and will not be objective.            And I propose that he should be allowed to review whatever he wants, which I imagine will continue to happen. I've been following ANN for a while, and considering he really liked JJK (way more than I did), did super in-depth adoring reviews on AoT (which personally just allowed me to see that the show was continuing not to be my thing at all but I admired his passion) and his criticisms of Demon Slayer were pretty mild, it's just that fanbase is ridiculous, I never got the impression he doesn't like shonen or doesn't fall into its audience at all. And he's suited just fine for this series, as the reason people are interested in THIS show is because it's offering a bit of a twist on the isekai premise, and that seems to be what he was hooked by as well. This review focused on whether the show itself held together beyond that initial hook, and offered a fair assessment.   And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

REVIEW: The Executioner and Her Way of Life [1/3] - Forum - Anime News Network:SEA,"I like this series and I like the characters.  So looking at this one as a must see to the end.  I wonder if the anime adaptation will beat out the english light novels.   About Menou, while the anime shows her killing someone who probably deserves to die, we must remember spoiler[she and her group kill everyone who has that power/skill.  Guilt or innocence doesn't matter.  People who want to have normal lives within soceity and don't use their power/skill, are still hunted down and killed.  If you have been isekai'd, they will search for you, and they will kill you.  So even if you choose to be a good person and not use your power, you will still be killed.]  So Menou is a problematic character.  You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.

I would say that it's difficult to determine, in regards to Sonic's video game presence it could be argued that Sonic Mania brought back the character to the gaming world after the disaster that was Sonic Boom, but due to Forces and Colors Ultimate general bad reception amongst gamers I think his future in gaming is still up in the air unless Frontiers exceeds all expectations.  In terms of Sonic's popularity outside the videogame realm I'd say that we're truly living a renaissance. As opposed to the games' reception Boom's cartoon was enjoyable, Sonic made some fun cameos in Wreck-it-Ralph 1 and 2, he got a special appearance in OK K.O, the new Sonic comic seems to be doing great, there's that Netflix show in development, and Sonic's movie has become a franchise at Paramount.

I would say that it's difficult to determine, in regards to Sonic's video game presence it could be argued that Sonic Mania brought back the character to the gaming world after the disaster that was Sonic Boom, but due to Forces and Colors Ultimate general bad reception amongst gamers I think his future in gaming is still up in the air unless Frontiers exceeds all expectations.  In terms of Sonic's popularity outside the videogame realm I'd say that we're truly living a renaissance. As opposed to the games' reception Boom's cartoon was enjoyable, Sonic made some fun cameos in Wreck-it-Ralph 1 and 2, he got a special appearance in OK K.O, the new Sonic comic seems to be doing great, there's that Netflix show in development, and Sonic's movie has become a franchise at Paramount.  I think it could be argued that Sonic has become more of multimedia IP and not just a videogame icon, kids these days are probably more familiar with Sonic by his appearances in other media than his own videogames, I mean I have two nephews that love Sonic but never played any of his games, I tried making them play the original Genesis game but they couldn't pass the first enemy      Back to top                  Mr. sickVisionz    Joined: 28 Oct 2007 		    Posts: 2124       Posted: Mon Apr 25, 2022 8:09 pm              Quote:    Ben Schwartz (DuckTales, Parks and Recreation) voiced the title character Sonic in the original film.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Takuma Terashima and Inori Minase also play off each other very well.    I also love how they went ahead and did a full ED sequence on Aharen's dance.

I would say no to her being Autistic, as most women who get it tend to be on the very low end of the Spectrum (non-verbal, violent fits, biting). Aharen shows none of those aspects. She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.

She could have Asperger’s, but definitely not straight-up Autism.           Asperger's Syndrome doesn't technically exist anymore. It's been folded into the general Autism Spectrum Disorder, or ASD as of 2013 (in the US), and 2022 (worldwide). Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

Still, that teeny tiny upturn he managed did melt my heart.

So much great comedy moments...Raido inconsolable after the movie (even Aharen cried!), the freestyle rapping communicating, fidget-spinner Aharen and Raido being worried about her future, Raido worried that everything was trying to kill them, and Raido trying to save face after losing to a little girl in Reversi.   Also look at Aharen trying to support childhood friend romances!   Aharen summoning her dog to carry her is the most Aharen-thing ever.

Also, the argument that women tend to be on the low end of the spectrum strikes me as rather off, to say the least. Women ""hide"" their symptoms better than men because society expects them to. It's not abnormal for men to be bad at communication, or be bad at expressing/reading emotion or social cues. But it's considered an aberration for a woman to do so, and they're forced to adapt, so their symptoms don't display the same way.   As far as the OP goes, Aharen does have neuro divergent traits, but they're almost definitely not going to be acknowledged as anything more than her personality.

It's been the highlight of my Sunday morning for about a year now. (Speaking of which, the new chapter is out...)   Shin is a good boy. Lu is a good girl. Sakamoto is best team dad. (Even though he's apparently supposed to be younger than me. I feel old now.) The SPYxFAMILY parallels are a lot more obvious to me now that the anime has started, but knowing that now doesn't diminish how much fun I've had with it overall. The way Shin's mind-reading is integrated with the paneling is probably my favorite running gag. He is our fourth wall.     Quote:    − Fat jokes aren't necessary         Without delving into spoiler territory, you (and anyone else snagging on that particular note) may be relieved to know that the series does eventually take a different stance on Sakamoto's weight.

Same here. If John Wick's spouse did not die and his family was allowed to grow while running a convenience store this would be the result.

In a technical sense, anime adaptation-wise, this will be One Punch Man 2.0.

Chapter3 really was a low-point of the series but thankfully it picked itself up afterwards and became one of the best series in WSJ right now. Certainly has some of the absolute best fights with some incredible action-artwork. And I love Lu as the actual female lead, she is a ton of fun.

And I think it was a good decision because the author is better displaying action scenes than comedy (and drawing characters is not his forte).   Of course, there will be comedy spoiler[(like when Sakamoto fights grandmas from Hell or the clueless sniper)] but Sakamoto Days is nowadays an action series.      Back to top                  R.

I read the first preview chapter on Viz's website the other day, and while it was good, it just wasn't good enough to get me to add it to my already chock-full manga pile. The action scenes didn't do as much for me as the comedy, so given your comment, I feel more like I made the right call about passing on this series.

The tendency for action series to constantly one-up themselves becomes the joke, and its roots as a comedy series means it can get away with stunts that a more ""grounded"" action series could never pull off. The question is never ""who lives and who dies"" but, ""okay, how are they getting out of this one?""

It's been the highlight of my Sunday morning for about a year now. (Speaking of which, the new chapter is out...)   Shin is a good boy. Lu is a good girl. Sakamoto is best team dad. (Even though he's apparently supposed to be younger than me. I feel old now.) The SPYxFAMILY parallels are a lot more obvious to me now that the anime has started, but knowing that now doesn't diminish how much fun I've had with it overall. The way Shin's mind-reading is integrated with the paneling is probably my favorite running gag. He is our fourth wall.     Quote:    − Fat jokes aren't necessary         Without delving into spoiler territory, you (and anyone else snagging on that particular note) may be relieved to know that the series does eventually take a different stance on Sakamoto's weight.

Same here. If John Wick's spouse did not die and his family was allowed to grow while running a convenience store this would be the result.

In a technical sense, anime adaptation-wise, this will be One Punch Man 2.0.

Been on my mind ever since I started seeing the promos for this manga.

Chapter3 really was a low-point of the series but thankfully it picked itself up afterwards and became one of the best series in WSJ right now. Certainly has some of the absolute best fights with some incredible action-artwork. And I love Lu as the actual female lead, she is a ton of fun.

And I think it was a good decision because the author is better displaying action scenes than comedy (and drawing characters is not his forte).   Of course, there will be comedy spoiler[(like when Sakamoto fights grandmas from Hell or the clueless sniper)] but Sakamoto Days is nowadays an action series.      Back to top                  R.

I read the first preview chapter on Viz's website the other day, and while it was good, it just wasn't good enough to get me to add it to my already chock-full manga pile. The action scenes didn't do as much for me as the comedy, so given your comment, I feel more like I made the right call about passing on this series.

The tendency for action series to constantly one-up themselves becomes the joke, and its roots as a comedy series means it can get away with stunts that a more ""grounded"" action series could never pull off. The question is never ""who lives and who dies"" but, ""okay, how are they getting out of this one?""

It's been the highlight of my Sunday morning for about a year now. (Speaking of which, the new chapter is out...)   Shin is a good boy. Lu is a good girl. Sakamoto is best team dad. (Even though he's apparently supposed to be younger than me. I feel old now.) The SPYxFAMILY parallels are a lot more obvious to me now that the anime has started, but knowing that now doesn't diminish how much fun I've had with it overall. The way Shin's mind-reading is integrated with the paneling is probably my favorite running gag. He is our fourth wall.     Quote:    − Fat jokes aren't necessary         Without delving into spoiler territory, you (and anyone else snagging on that particular note) may be relieved to know that the series does eventually take a different stance on Sakamoto's weight.

Same here. If John Wick's spouse did not die and his family was allowed to grow while running a convenience store this would be the result.

In a technical sense, anime adaptation-wise, this will be One Punch Man 2.0.

Been on my mind ever since I started seeing the promos for this manga.

Chapter3 really was a low-point of the series but thankfully it picked itself up afterwards and became one of the best series in WSJ right now. Certainly has some of the absolute best fights with some incredible action-artwork. And I love Lu as the actual female lead, she is a ton of fun.

And I think it was a good decision because the author is better displaying action scenes than comedy (and drawing characters is not his forte).   Of course, there will be comedy spoiler[(like when Sakamoto fights grandmas from Hell or the clueless sniper)] but Sakamoto Days is nowadays an action series.      Back to top                  R.

I read the first preview chapter on Viz's website the other day, and while it was good, it just wasn't good enough to get me to add it to my already chock-full manga pile. The action scenes didn't do as much for me as the comedy, so given your comment, I feel more like I made the right call about passing on this series.

The tendency for action series to constantly one-up themselves becomes the joke, and its roots as a comedy series means it can get away with stunts that a more ""grounded"" action series could never pull off. The question is never ""who lives and who dies"" but, ""okay, how are they getting out of this one?""

And I think it was a good decision because the author is better displaying action scenes than comedy (and drawing characters is not his forte).   Of course, there will be comedy spoiler[(like when Sakamoto fights grandmas from Hell or the clueless sniper)] but Sakamoto Days is nowadays an action series.      Back to top                  R.

The tendency for action series to constantly one-up themselves becomes the joke, and its roots as a comedy series means it can get away with stunts that a more ""grounded"" action series could never pull off. The question is never ""who lives and who dies"" but, ""okay, how are they getting out of this one?""

Chapter3 really was a low-point of the series but thankfully it picked itself up afterwards and became one of the best series in WSJ right now. Certainly has some of the absolute best fights with some incredible action-artwork. And I love Lu as the actual female lead, she is a ton of fun.

And I think it was a good decision because the author is better displaying action scenes than comedy (and drawing characters is not his forte).   Of course, there will be comedy spoiler[(like when Sakamoto fights grandmas from Hell or the clueless sniper)] but Sakamoto Days is nowadays an action series.      Back to top                  R.

News My Happy Marriage Novel Series Gets Live-Action Film in Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-25 15:08 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film stars Snow Man's Ren Meguro, Mio Imada     TOHO announced on Monday that it is producing a live-action film adaptation of writer Akumi Agitogi and illustrator Tsukiho Tsukioka's My Happy Marriage (Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon) light novel series that will open in spring 2023. Ren Meguro (right in image below) from the idol group Snow Man will star as Kiyoka, while Mio Imada (left in image below) will star as Miyo.     Ayuko Tsukahara is directing the film, with a script by Tomoe Kanno.    Agitogi and Tsukioka launched the novel series in January 2019. The novels' fifth volume shipped in July 2021. Yen Press licensed the light novels, and it describes the story:   Born to a noble family, Miyo is raised by her abusive stepmother and married off to Kiyoka, a soldier so heartless his prior fiancées fled within three days into their engagement. With no home to return to, Miyo slowly starts to open her heart to her cold and pale husband-to-be, despite their rocky introduction... This might just be her chance at finding true love and happiness.  Yen Press released the first novel volume in English on January 18. The novels are also inspiring an upcoming television anime adaptation by Kinema Citrus.    Rito Kohsaka's manga adaptation debuted on Square Enix's Gangan Online website in December 2018. The manga's third compiled book volume shipped in Japan in October 2021. Square Enix Manga & Books licensed the manga, and it will launch it physically and digitally on June 21.

News My Happy Marriage Novel Series Gets Live-Action Film in Spring 2023   posted on 2022-04-25 15:08 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Film stars Snow Man's Ren Meguro, Mio Imada     TOHO announced on Monday that it is producing a live-action film adaptation of writer Akumi Agitogi and illustrator Tsukiho Tsukioka's My Happy Marriage (Watashi no Shiawase na Kekkon) light novel series that will open in spring 2023. Ren Meguro (right in image below) from the idol group Snow Man will star as Kiyoka, while Mio Imada (left in image below) will star as Miyo.     Ayuko Tsukahara is directing the film, with a script by Tomoe Kanno.    Agitogi and Tsukioka launched the novel series in January 2019. The novels' fifth volume shipped in July 2021. Yen Press licensed the light novels, and it describes the story:   Born to a noble family, Miyo is raised by her abusive stepmother and married off to Kiyoka, a soldier so heartless his prior fiancées fled within three days into their engagement. With no home to return to, Miyo slowly starts to open her heart to her cold and pale husband-to-be, despite their rocky introduction... This might just be her chance at finding true love and happiness.  Yen Press released the first novel volume in English on January 18. The novels are also inspiring an upcoming television anime adaptation by Kinema Citrus.    Rito Kohsaka's manga adaptation debuted on Square Enix's Gangan Online website in December 2018. The manga's third compiled book volume shipped in Japan in October 2021. Square Enix Manga & Books licensed the manga, and it will launch it physically and digitally on June 21.

Square Enix announced a lavish 1/6 scale figure of Terra from Final Fantasy VI on Sunday. As beautifully crafted as this statue of Terra in her Magitek is, the bigger subject of conversation has been its hefty price tag: 1,485,000 yen, or approximately US$11,570.     SQEX MASTERLINE FFVIは販売価格1,485,000円（税込）、2023年7月28日発売予定、全世界600個限定生産（そのうち日本は150個）です。※各国の割り振りは受注状況によって変更の可能性がございます※生産数に達し次第予約終了とさせていただきます#SQEXMASTERLINE #FF6 pic.twitter.com/OCGI5WeKwo— SQUARE ENIX Official Goods (@SQEX_MD_GOODS) April 24, 2022     Not only have die-hard fans been commenting on the steep price, even Final Fantasy director Hironobu Sakaguchi tweeted: ""Whoa, that's a bit much.""    Production will be limited to 600 units, with 150 of them in Japan. Orders opened on Square Enix's Japan store on Monday, and will run until June 24 (or until stock runs out).    A video interview with Yoshitaka Amano, who designed the original logo that the statue is based on, is available with English subtitles.    The original Final Fantasy VI game launched for Super Famicom in Japan in 1994. The game has since had releases on PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, smartphones, and PC.

Review   by Grant Jones, Apr 26th 2022       Ragna Crimson Volume 4                     Synopsis:               Ragna remains frozen inside [the progenitor]'s time prison. However, a flashback reveals that Ragna was offered a chance to be raised to the status of a dragon and had some of their blood put in his veins. He rejected their offer, but the blood helps him overcome her time freeze power and strike her down. Crimson intervenes as well, and in the ensuing carnage they both escape to Crimson's pocket dimension. Sadly, this too is destroyed, and the teleport to another hunter base headed up by the Silverware Princess – Princess Starlia. The plot thickens and the pressure mounts as the dragons advance and Starlia scrutinizes their every move.    Ragna Crimson is written by Daiki Kobayashi and published by Square Enix. Volume 4 covers chapters 14-18.       Review:         Synopsis:          Ragna remains frozen inside [the progenitor]'s time prison.

Volume 4 covers chapters 14-18.      Review:            Ragna Crimson continues to find new ways to impress me. My reception to the series has only grown more positive as each volume expands its world, broadens its cast, and enriches its conceptual landscape. This volume was my favorite by far, and honestly I can't wait to see what's next.    For starters, the resolution of the Ragna versus Lady Ultimatia fight delivers. The core conceit of Ragna's escape is precisely the sort of ridiculous technicality that I like to see in my action comics. “You put in an exception to your time freeze that would allow other dragons of your blood to be immune to it, but because I still have lingering blood from the failed transformation that technically includes me as well!” It's superheroic legalese in the best sense, and the payoff is yet more bombastic fight sequences with monsters, dragons, and acidic slimes.    It has to be said that Crimson steals the show once again. As a character, Crimson is much more expressive (in every regard) than Ragna, which allows for a broader emotional range as well as a greater variety of story beats and dialogue. Ragna is direct, perhaps too direct; he is a man consumed by his mission, making him rather one-note. Which is fine, because Crimson is there to pick up the slack and deliver on all the other great moments. Crimson's comedic timing pairs well with their sadistic streak, making them one of those characters who is entertaining to follow in success or failure, because their commentary is so engaging.    The Silverware Princess is also a terrific addition to the cast. First of all, she is a great character in her own right. Her powers are really cool conceptually and look great on the page. A perfectionist who makes all her own armor and weapons, with an intense, piercing gaze and the ability to sense auras – it's a great mix of character traits and abilities. She's also a breath of fresh air compared to most of the other cast members outside of Ragna and Crimson, which fall into three broad camps: mustache-twirling dragons, incompetent humans, or servants of Crimson. The Silverware Princess and her Argentum corps have a much more complex relationship with Ragna and Crimson. She and her crew are not exactly enemies, being hunters who also are trying to protect humanity against the dragons. But they are not exactly allies either. For one thing, Princess Starlia is uncompromising in her pursuit of perfection and purity, whereas Crimson is “the ends justify the means” personified. They need each other's help if they want to triumph against the shared enemy of the dragons, and that lends a wonderful tension to their scenes hanging over the already gripping tension of whether Crimson can convincingly lie.    There's also some genuinely great comedy to be found in the princess and Ragna's interactions. Now, I'm not usually a fan of the love-at-first-sight trope: I think the way it is usually handled is awkward at best, and often downright confusing – at worst, it can be actively detrimental to the lovestruck subject's characterization. However, the trope actually works here because it is rooted in previously established character traits. In terms of his power set, we know that Ragna is fused with his silverine sword. Emotionally, we know Ragna is a man on a crusade with a single-minded ambition to defeat all dragons – essentially a living weapon against them. So to have the Silverware Princess see his clarity of purpose and find that compellingly attractive makes sense, especially as she too is just as driven in the pursuit of her own goals. She sees him as an equal in dedication, and there's a spark there. Most importantly, it leads to one of the funniest visual gags in the entire run: Ragna as a sword with arms and legs. It also manages to be accurate in-text as it is the Silverware Princess's perspective and does not break the fourth wall. Kobayashi's little doodle in the final pages of them running together gave me a nice belly laugh.    The art has been consistently incredible from the word go and nothing has changed here. The level of detail and dynamism in every panel is truly impressive; Ragna Crimson's art has set a high visual bar, especially in the action sequences, and shows no signs of stopping. Watching Ragna and Nebulim face off or the progenitor get carved to pieces is premium visceral entertainment. The varied backdrops of the capital and Crimson's pocket dimension are lavishly detailed, whether in the midst of peace or destruction. God bless Kobayashi for the extraordinary craftsmanship on display in the art and pacing.    There are also no shortage of truly artful flourishes. I loved the sequence when Ragna broke through the time lock and all of the lettering left the word balloons and became these geometric, angular sentence structures, as if they have transcended the bounds of comic language and time itself. It was disorienting and difficult to read, sure, but creative liberties like that do a terrific job in underscoring the events on the page. Another memorable moment is the near-splash page where Crimson set off the bombs on the castle walls. The body language, the shadowed face with the shark's teeth beneath the veil, the huge rolling explosions – it's a gripping image in a work full of them.    I don't have much to complain about in this volume, but here is the ongoing issue of Ragna's friend Leonica. I understand her singular mission to protect someone in an abstract sense, but in practical terms she is just kind of a placeholder character to me. She shows up briefly in this volume, says some forgettable dialogue, and then we get back to the stuff I actually care about. I'm also broadly unsure of the actual power or capabilities of the characters in any given scene. Everyone is on such a high power level and we have not had a lot of prior conflict to set benchmark expectations. Given how quickly the tables can turn it can make for mild whiplash trying to figure out what is about to happen on a moment-to-moment basis. The sheer visual spectacle of it all largely makes up for this, but I'd be lying if I said that I had a feel for the tempo of these battles.    Ragna Crimson is getting better with each entry, and I think I can safely say I'm a fan of the series now.             Grade:      Overall : A- Story : B+ Art : A+  + Princess Starlia is a great addition to the cast, delivers on earlier plot threads, stellar art − Early weak points, like Leonica's characterization and unclear power levels, are still there            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Daiki Kobayashi   Full encyclopedia details aboutRagna Crimson (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Review   by Grant Jones, Apr 26th 2022       Ragna Crimson Volume 4                     Synopsis:               Ragna remains frozen inside [the progenitor]'s time prison. However, a flashback reveals that Ragna was offered a chance to be raised to the status of a dragon and had some of their blood put in his veins. He rejected their offer, but the blood helps him overcome her time freeze power and strike her down. Crimson intervenes as well, and in the ensuing carnage they both escape to Crimson's pocket dimension. Sadly, this too is destroyed, and the teleport to another hunter base headed up by the Silverware Princess – Princess Starlia. The plot thickens and the pressure mounts as the dragons advance and Starlia scrutinizes their every move.    Ragna Crimson is written by Daiki Kobayashi and published by Square Enix. Volume 4 covers chapters 14-18.       Review:         Synopsis:          Ragna remains frozen inside [the progenitor]'s time prison.

Volume 4 covers chapters 14-18.      Review:            Ragna Crimson continues to find new ways to impress me. My reception to the series has only grown more positive as each volume expands its world, broadens its cast, and enriches its conceptual landscape. This volume was my favorite by far, and honestly I can't wait to see what's next.    For starters, the resolution of the Ragna versus Lady Ultimatia fight delivers. The core conceit of Ragna's escape is precisely the sort of ridiculous technicality that I like to see in my action comics. “You put in an exception to your time freeze that would allow other dragons of your blood to be immune to it, but because I still have lingering blood from the failed transformation that technically includes me as well!” It's superheroic legalese in the best sense, and the payoff is yet more bombastic fight sequences with monsters, dragons, and acidic slimes.    It has to be said that Crimson steals the show once again. As a character, Crimson is much more expressive (in every regard) than Ragna, which allows for a broader emotional range as well as a greater variety of story beats and dialogue. Ragna is direct, perhaps too direct; he is a man consumed by his mission, making him rather one-note. Which is fine, because Crimson is there to pick up the slack and deliver on all the other great moments. Crimson's comedic timing pairs well with their sadistic streak, making them one of those characters who is entertaining to follow in success or failure, because their commentary is so engaging.    The Silverware Princess is also a terrific addition to the cast. First of all, she is a great character in her own right. Her powers are really cool conceptually and look great on the page. A perfectionist who makes all her own armor and weapons, with an intense, piercing gaze and the ability to sense auras – it's a great mix of character traits and abilities. She's also a breath of fresh air compared to most of the other cast members outside of Ragna and Crimson, which fall into three broad camps: mustache-twirling dragons, incompetent humans, or servants of Crimson. The Silverware Princess and her Argentum corps have a much more complex relationship with Ragna and Crimson. She and her crew are not exactly enemies, being hunters who also are trying to protect humanity against the dragons. But they are not exactly allies either. For one thing, Princess Starlia is uncompromising in her pursuit of perfection and purity, whereas Crimson is “the ends justify the means” personified. They need each other's help if they want to triumph against the shared enemy of the dragons, and that lends a wonderful tension to their scenes hanging over the already gripping tension of whether Crimson can convincingly lie.    There's also some genuinely great comedy to be found in the princess and Ragna's interactions. Now, I'm not usually a fan of the love-at-first-sight trope: I think the way it is usually handled is awkward at best, and often downright confusing – at worst, it can be actively detrimental to the lovestruck subject's characterization. However, the trope actually works here because it is rooted in previously established character traits. In terms of his power set, we know that Ragna is fused with his silverine sword. Emotionally, we know Ragna is a man on a crusade with a single-minded ambition to defeat all dragons – essentially a living weapon against them. So to have the Silverware Princess see his clarity of purpose and find that compellingly attractive makes sense, especially as she too is just as driven in the pursuit of her own goals. She sees him as an equal in dedication, and there's a spark there. Most importantly, it leads to one of the funniest visual gags in the entire run: Ragna as a sword with arms and legs. It also manages to be accurate in-text as it is the Silverware Princess's perspective and does not break the fourth wall. Kobayashi's little doodle in the final pages of them running together gave me a nice belly laugh.    The art has been consistently incredible from the word go and nothing has changed here. The level of detail and dynamism in every panel is truly impressive; Ragna Crimson's art has set a high visual bar, especially in the action sequences, and shows no signs of stopping. Watching Ragna and Nebulim face off or the progenitor get carved to pieces is premium visceral entertainment. The varied backdrops of the capital and Crimson's pocket dimension are lavishly detailed, whether in the midst of peace or destruction. God bless Kobayashi for the extraordinary craftsmanship on display in the art and pacing.    There are also no shortage of truly artful flourishes. I loved the sequence when Ragna broke through the time lock and all of the lettering left the word balloons and became these geometric, angular sentence structures, as if they have transcended the bounds of comic language and time itself. It was disorienting and difficult to read, sure, but creative liberties like that do a terrific job in underscoring the events on the page. Another memorable moment is the near-splash page where Crimson set off the bombs on the castle walls. The body language, the shadowed face with the shark's teeth beneath the veil, the huge rolling explosions – it's a gripping image in a work full of them.    I don't have much to complain about in this volume, but here is the ongoing issue of Ragna's friend Leonica. I understand her singular mission to protect someone in an abstract sense, but in practical terms she is just kind of a placeholder character to me. She shows up briefly in this volume, says some forgettable dialogue, and then we get back to the stuff I actually care about. I'm also broadly unsure of the actual power or capabilities of the characters in any given scene. Everyone is on such a high power level and we have not had a lot of prior conflict to set benchmark expectations. Given how quickly the tables can turn it can make for mild whiplash trying to figure out what is about to happen on a moment-to-moment basis. The sheer visual spectacle of it all largely makes up for this, but I'd be lying if I said that I had a feel for the tempo of these battles.    Ragna Crimson is getting better with each entry, and I think I can safely say I'm a fan of the series now.             Grade:      Overall : A- Story : B+ Art : A+  + Princess Starlia is a great addition to the cast, delivers on earlier plot threads, stellar art − Early weak points, like Leonica's characterization and unclear power levels, are still there            discuss this in the forum |        bookmark/share with:                  				Add this manga to 				               Production Info:        Story & Art: Daiki Kobayashi   Full encyclopedia details aboutRagna Crimson (manga)        Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Review   by Grant Jones, Apr 26th 2022       Ragna Crimson Volume 4                     Synopsis:               Ragna remains frozen inside [the progenitor]'s time prison. However, a flashback reveals that Ragna was offered a chance to be raised to the status of a dragon and had some of their blood put in his veins. He rejected their offer, but the blood helps him overcome her time freeze power and strike her down. Crimson intervenes as well, and in the ensuing carnage they both escape to Crimson's pocket dimension. Sadly, this too is destroyed, and the teleport to another hunter base headed up by the Silverware Princess – Princess Starlia. The plot thickens and the pressure mounts as the dragons advance and Starlia scrutinizes their every move.    Ragna Crimson is written by Daiki Kobayashi and published by Square Enix. Volume 4 covers chapters 14-18.       Review:         Synopsis:          Ragna remains frozen inside [the progenitor]'s time prison.

Volume 4 covers chapters 14-18.      Review:            Ragna Crimson continues to find new ways to impress me. My reception to the series has only grown more positive as each volume expands its world, broadens its cast, and enriches its conceptual landscape. This volume was my favorite by far, and honestly I can't wait to see what's next.    For starters, the resolution of the Ragna versus Lady Ultimatia fight delivers. The core conceit of Ragna's escape is precisely the sort of ridiculous technicality that I like to see in my action comics. “You put in an exception to your time freeze that would allow other dragons of your blood to be immune to it, but because I still have lingering blood from the failed transformation that technically includes me as well!” It's superheroic legalese in the best sense, and the payoff is yet more bombastic fight sequences with monsters, dragons, and acidic slimes.    It has to be said that Crimson steals the show once again. As a character, Crimson is much more expressive (in every regard) than Ragna, which allows for a broader emotional range as well as a greater variety of story beats and dialogue. Ragna is direct, perhaps too direct; he is a man consumed by his mission, making him rather one-note. Which is fine, because Crimson is there to pick up the slack and deliver on all the other great moments. Crimson's comedic timing pairs well with their sadistic streak, making them one of those characters who is entertaining to follow in success or failure, because their commentary is so engaging.    The Silverware Princess is also a terrific addition to the cast. First of all, she is a great character in her own right. Her powers are really cool conceptually and look great on the page. A perfectionist who makes all her own armor and weapons, with an intense, piercing gaze and the ability to sense auras – it's a great mix of character traits and abilities. She's also a breath of fresh air compared to most of the other cast members outside of Ragna and Crimson, which fall into three broad camps: mustache-twirling dragons, incompetent humans, or servants of Crimson. The Silverware Princess and her Argentum corps have a much more complex relationship with Ragna and Crimson. She and her crew are not exactly enemies, being hunters who also are trying to protect humanity against the dragons. But they are not exactly allies either. For one thing, Princess Starlia is uncompromising in her pursuit of perfection and purity, whereas Crimson is “the ends justify the means” personified. They need each other's help if they want to triumph against the shared enemy of the dragons, and that lends a wonderful tension to their scenes hanging over the already gripping tension of whether Crimson can convincingly lie.    There's also some genuinely great comedy to be found in the princess and Ragna's interactions. Now, I'm not usually a fan of the love-at-first-sight trope: I think the way it is usually handled is awkward at best, and often downright confusing – at worst, it can be actively detrimental to the lovestruck subject's characterization. However, the trope actually works here because it is rooted in previously established character traits. In terms of his power set, we know that Ragna is fused with his silverine sword. Emotionally, we know Ragna is a man on a crusade with a single-minded ambition to defeat all dragons – essentially a living weapon against them. So to have the Silverware Princess see his clarity of purpose and find that compellingly attractive makes sense, especially as she too is just as driven in the pursuit of her own goals. She sees him as an equal in dedication, and there's a spark there. Most importantly, it leads to one of the funniest visual gags in the entire run: Ragna as a sword with arms and legs. It also manages to be accurate in-text as it is the Silverware Princess's perspective and does not break the fourth wall. Kobayashi's little doodle in the final pages of them running together gave me a nice belly laugh.    The art has been consistently incredible from the word go and nothing has changed here. The level of detail and dynamism in every panel is truly impressive; Ragna Crimson's art has set a high visual bar, especially in the action sequences, and shows no signs of stopping. Watching Ragna and Nebulim face off or the progenitor get carved to pieces is premium visceral entertainment. The varied backdrops of the capital and Crimson's pocket dimension are lavishly detailed, whether in the midst of peace or destruction. God bless Kobayashi for the extraordinary craftsmanship on display in the art and pacing.    There are also no shortage of truly artful flourishes. I loved the sequence when Ragna broke through the time lock and all of the lettering left the word balloons and became these geometric, angular sentence structures, as if they have transcended the bounds of comic language and time itself. It was disorienting and difficult to read, sure, but creative liberties like that do a terrific job in underscoring the events on the page. Another memorable moment is the near-splash page where Crimson set off the bombs on the castle walls. The body language, the shadowed face with the shark's teeth beneath the veil, the huge rolling explosions – it's a gripping image in a work full of them.    I don't have much to complain about in this volume, but here is the ongoing issue of Ragna's friend Leonica. I understand her singular mission to protect someone in an abstract sense, but in practical terms she is just kind of a placeholder character to me. She shows up briefly in this volume, says some forgettable dialogue, and then we get back to the stuff I actually care about. I'm also broadly unsure of the actual power or capabilities of the characters in any given scene. Everyone is on such a high power level and we have not had a lot of prior conflict to set benchmark expectations.

The varied backdrops of the capital and Crimson's pocket dimension are lavishly detailed, whether in the midst of peace or destruction. God bless Kobayashi for the extraordinary craftsmanship on display in the art and pacing.    There are also no shortage of truly artful flourishes. I loved the sequence when Ragna broke through the time lock and all of the lettering left the word balloons and became these geometric, angular sentence structures, as if they have transcended the bounds of comic language and time itself. It was disorienting and difficult to read, sure, but creative liberties like that do a terrific job in underscoring the events on the page. Another memorable moment is the near-splash page where Crimson set off the bombs on the castle walls. The body language, the shadowed face with the shark's teeth beneath the veil, the huge rolling explosions – it's a gripping image in a work full of them.    I don't have much to complain about in this volume, but here is the ongoing issue of Ragna's friend Leonica. I understand her singular mission to protect someone in an abstract sense, but in practical terms she is just kind of a placeholder character to me. She shows up briefly in this volume, says some forgettable dialogue, and then we get back to the stuff I actually care about.
