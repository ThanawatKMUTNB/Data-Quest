The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Tomodachi Game   Apr  6th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Tomodachi Game ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass.

You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance.

Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends?

Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into.

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals.

However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",negative,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.9              What is this?   Yūichi Katagiri, a young man with a perfect student life who has four friends with difficult lives. His peaceful daily life comes to an end when 2 million yen (about US$20,000) in school trip fees goes missing. Riddles unfold as Yūichi gets caught up in a mysterious game for money and must decide whether friendship or money matters more.    Tomodachi Game is based on Yuki Sato's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Tuesdays.      How was the first episode?    James Beckett  Rating:                Any time a survival game anime pops up during Preview Guide, I get a little anxious. Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game.

Not because I dislike the genre or anything—Danganronpa is one of my favorite franchises, as it so happens. The problem is that, for every smash hit like Danganronpa, it feels like there are a dozen would-be imitators that keep trying (and failing) to find new and fresh ways to mess with murder/betrayal/escape-room formula. To put it bluntly, a lot of survival game anime kind of suck. Tomodachi Game doesn't exactly suck, and there are even elements of this premiere that I find fairly interesting, but the overall package is just so wrapped up in tired clichés and mediocre presentation that it's hard to muster up enough energy to care one way or the other.    I'll give it this, though: It's nice that Yuichi and all of the other contestants of this weird game were all friends first. There's no amnesia, no cadre of bizarrely coifed and cartoonishly rendered strangers who all have to monologue about their backstories one after the other. The angle that Tomodachi Game is exploring is a tried and true one, but it's effective nonetheless. It asks, “How well do you really know your best friends? And how much pressure would it take, financial or otherwise, before the masks come off and even the closest of companions turn on each other?”    It's just a shame the game being used to exploit this premise is so ludicrously overcomplicated, not to mention heavy-handed as all hell. You know what makes an interesting thriller premise like the one above a lot less interesting? When a cast of vaguely defined characters are forced to participate in an inane game-show that is designed to have every single element of their experience literally scream, over and over, “CAN YOU TRUST YOUR FRIENDS? HUH? I BETCHA CAN'T!!” It kind of ruins the experience.    Don't get me started on the knockoff Monokuma, either. I get that all of these survival game anime feel obligated to include a “wacky"" mascot character, but they really shouldn't try so goddamned hard just because Danganronpa and Assassination Classroom made bank on the concept. And no, I don't even care that Manabu-kun is actually voiced by the actress who played actual Danganronpa protagonist Hajime Hinata. I hate the little creep. He's goofy-looking and obnoxious, and the show does a terrible job of blending the interactions of the CG character model with his 2D counterparts. Every time Manabu was onscreen, I wanted to see someone toss him straight out of a window and into oncoming traffic.    Worst of all, I feel like I'm going to see most of the “shocking"" and “edgy"" twists of this story coming well in advance, so, unless something positively wild and unheard of is yet to come in this story, I'm happy to give Tomodachi Game a pass. There have been other, better riffs on this formula over the years, and I'd rather revisit those than stick it out with a mediocre-seeming also-ran like this one. I'm going to call it right now, though, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series or anything: It was the meek girl that got all of the friends roped into the game. I bet she's also secretly a psycho yandere. Hit me up in a few weeks if it turns out that I'm right.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               In general, I enjoy anime that focus on high-stakes, psychological games—be they death games or more gambling-focused ones. However, Tomodachi Game didn't excite me at all. When watching an anime set in a well-established genre, there is one question always at the back of my mind: What sets this show apart?  In the case of Tomodachi Game, the answer is ""nothing."" It's totally bland.    The characters, at this point, are surface layer clichés. We have the uptight beauty, the cute girl, the serious one, and the frivolous playboy. Even the main character is little more than ""the poor kid."" The result is Kakegurui without a Yumeko—a show with drama but no one for the audience to care about on a personal level.    Yet, even that drama is lackluster. Not only does the show reveal the masterminds behind the curtain way too easily, but their lackluster commentary in no way replaces the tension that comes from having no idea what is going on behind the scenes. Then there are the constant blink-and-you'll-miss-it text dumps on screen that require you to pause to read. This effectively hamstrings the show's pacing. But even worse, it obliterates the audience's sense of immersion. You can't just sit back and lose yourself in the world Tomodachi Game is trying to create: you've got to be ready to hit pause and read exposition at a moment's notice or miss out on vital information—like the literal rules of the game they are playing!    All that and the episode doesn't even manage to stick the landing. While the game itself is easy enough to understand, the lack of resolution within the first episode is a hindrance. After all, a cliffhanger only works if you care enough about the characters or story to want to come back next week. I don't.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Ah, emotional manipulation. Such a charming premise for any show, so why not make it even more lovely by throwing in a couple of random evil high school girls running a death game for groups of, specifically, five friends? Bonus points if it turns out that the entire thing was set up to point out the shoddy, self-serving nature of friendship, but it's the girls running the game who learn a little something about true friendship along the way instead!    Despite that opening paragraph, my main issue with Tomodachi Game really isn't its premise. Survival games have been a staple of fiction since at LEAST The Most Dangerous Game, and very likely before then if I could be bothered to remember any. Likewise the idea of how trustworthy your so-called friends are is one of the founding principles of certain YA subgenres, so the show is on fairly solid ground with its group of five pals who are tased into a strange white space that turns out to be someone's twisted playground. Starting things off with stolen money for a field trip also works decently well, even if one of the group was the one who's most likely to suffer for the loss and two others are among those most likely to have taken it in the first place. (In reality, I suspect that the girls running the game are responsible.) Where things falter is in the execution of the story, which seems to be a bit of a theme for today's episodes. The main problem is that we barely know these kids and no effort is expended to remedy that situation. In fact, a card with their names and their basic stereotypes is displayed at one point, letting us know precisely which genre trope everyone fits into. (That I then spent the rest of the episode being disturbed that baby-voiced, utterly helpless Kokorogi was labeled “the sexy one” is an entirely different issue.) This makes the matter of who survives and who dies not all that compelling of an issue, because not only do we not like any of them, we don't KNOW any of them. At this point I'm voting for Tenoji to go first because his hair looks like someone took a bite out of it and that annoys me unreasonably.    The survival game genre isn't impossible to do well. It's perhaps not even particularly difficult to do well. But Tomodachi Game seems hellbent on getting in its own way as much as possible with its paltry introductions, explanations that go between “too much” and “not enough,” and some very lackluster visuals. Unless you love the genre and will consume all forms of it, maybe give this a pass.        Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I give isekai shows a lot of guff for being simultaneously ubiquitous and dull, but if there's one genre that can eclipse even that otherworldly monolith in pure tedium, it's death games. One of my biggest worries is the massive success of Squid Game bringing this already over-saturated story idea to the big stage. And while this show isn't strictly a death game – all that's currently at stake is money – it's just as much of a slog to get through as every other hackney edgelord parade that tries to come up with a new spin on the prisoner's dilemma.    The biggest reason for that is just how undercooked the “Tomodachi” part of its title is. This is meant to be a dark and gritty look at how five dear and loving friends can be pushed to betray each other for money, but the central friendships of the group are basically nonexistent. We get all of one scene of the five characters talking before they're thrown into this low-rent Kakegurui ripoff, so watching their tenuous friendship fall apart while they play the most obviously rigged game on the planet just isn't dramatic. These are people we've gotten to know mainly through a single screen of text explaining their personalities to us, and none of them have strong enough personalities to overcome that and make this whole ordeal interesting. When they start betraying each other it doesn't mean anything because none of them are real characters, so the entire tension of this game falls flat.    I'm also just so, so tired of every one of these having to bark up the same tree. Every single one of these things thinks they need their own Monokuma, but once you've seen a couple creepy-cute mascot characters who are secretly ~evil~ it loses its impact. As such, all the CG anime mascot character amounts to is a squeaky-voiced exposition machine with zero impact. Add in the random overseer girls who have to comment on everything from their surveillance room, smugly laughing about how their totally devious mind games will ruin another friendship and you have a story that's so insufferably impressed with its cut-rate edginess that finishing the episode is a feat of endurance.    The one and only bright spot of this premiere is in the very final moments, where it seems like our hapless protagonist has come up with some kind of plan to outsmart the Kokkuri-san game that his friends have all purposefully bought into. That, at least, could be a novel twist to this whole setup – our hero having to 4D-Chess his way into making his friends all play fair so they can clear their debts together, forcing a happy ending in the face of obvious psychological manipulation. I have very little faith that's where the show will actually go, but it would at least be a spin on this scenario that I haven't seen done a million times. It's still not enough to make watch more of this charmless bore, but it's something, I guess.

Also Kronii having Ghost Stories (of which im almost 100% she means the dub) makes too much sense.

Sana picked some lesser-known underrated shows that she probably feels need more love from the anime community (Katanagatari, The Eccentric Family, Rakugo), while Mumei the gremlin picked high intensity shows (Gurran Lagann, NGE, AoT). Kronii the time jokester skewed towards dark or humor (Madoka, Death Note, Ghost Stories).  Cali and Gura have chatted about Madoka together, and Cali has riffed on Ghost Stories with the Trash Taste boyz.

But when I look at this Top 10 lists for each of these hololive Council members, I do say that their most favorite series do pretty much match which Anime I do seem to favor more than others. So my interest is like a combination of all of these Council members put together.

News Utawarerumono Spinoff Game Monochrome Mobius Gets English PC Release   posted on 2022-04-26 16:14 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Game debuts in Japan on PS4/PS5, worldwide on Steam on September 8    Publisher Shiravune announced on Monday that it and DMM Games will release AQUAPLUS' Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten (Monochrome Mobius: Toki no Taika) game in English, Japanese, and Traditional Chinese on Steam on September 8. In addition, the game's official website revealed that the game will also ship in Japan on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 8. Shiravune is streaming an English-subtitled trailer for the game.      AQUAPLUS is also streaming the opening video and the teasers for the game.              Shiravune describes the game's story:    In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he encountered a girl he'd never met. The words the girl spoke were what shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man and the girl set out together towards the land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.   Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—    And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.    The game celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Utawarerumono franchise. Utawarerumono franchise head writer Suga Munemitsu is credited for the game's original concept and script. The artist mi is designing the characters. Franchise character designers Tatsuki Amazuyu and Misato Mitsumi are credited for original character designs. AQUAPLUS composer Naoya Shimokawa is composing the music.    AQUAPLUS released the original Utawarerumono game in 2002 for the PC. The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015. The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.

News Utawarerumono Spinoff Game Monochrome Mobius Gets English PC Release   posted on 2022-04-26 16:14 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Game debuts in Japan on PS4/PS5, worldwide on Steam on September 8    Publisher Shiravune announced on Monday that it and DMM Games will release AQUAPLUS' Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten (Monochrome Mobius: Toki no Taika) game in English, Japanese, and Traditional Chinese on Steam on September 8. In addition, the game's official website revealed that the game will also ship in Japan on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 8. Shiravune is streaming an English-subtitled trailer for the game.      AQUAPLUS is also streaming the opening video and the teasers for the game.              Shiravune describes the game's story:    In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he encountered a girl he'd never met. The words the girl spoke were what shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man and the girl set out together towards the land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.   Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—    And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.    The game celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Utawarerumono franchise. Utawarerumono franchise head writer Suga Munemitsu is credited for the game's original concept and script. The artist mi is designing the characters. Franchise character designers Tatsuki Amazuyu and Misato Mitsumi are credited for original character designs. AQUAPLUS composer Naoya Shimokawa is composing the music.    AQUAPLUS released the original Utawarerumono game in 2002 for the PC. The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015. The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Truth (Utawarerumono: Futari no Hakuoro), the last game in the Utawarerumono trilogy, launched in North America and Europe on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in September 2017. The game shipped in Japan for PlayStation 3, PS4, and PS Vita in September 2016. The game's television anime adaptation will premiere in July.

News Utawarerumono Spinoff Game Monochrome Mobius Gets English PC Release   posted on 2022-04-26 16:14 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Game debuts in Japan on PS4/PS5, worldwide on Steam on September 8    Publisher Shiravune announced on Monday that it and DMM Games will release AQUAPLUS' Monochrome Mobius: Rights and Wrongs Forgotten (Monochrome Mobius: Toki no Taika) game in English, Japanese, and Traditional Chinese on Steam on September 8. In addition, the game's official website revealed that the game will also ship in Japan on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 8. Shiravune is streaming an English-subtitled trailer for the game.      AQUAPLUS is also streaming the opening video and the teasers for the game.              Shiravune describes the game's story:    In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he encountered a girl he'd never met. The words the girl spoke were what shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man and the girl set out together towards the land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.   Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—    And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.    The game celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Utawarerumono franchise. Utawarerumono franchise head writer Suga Munemitsu is credited for the game's original concept and script. The artist mi is designing the characters. Franchise character designers Tatsuki Amazuyu and Misato Mitsumi are credited for original character designs.

The game inspired a 2006 television anime series and a 2009 original video anime series. ADV Films released the television series in North America in 2007, and Funimation has since picked up the North American release rights.    Utawarerumono: Mask of Deception (Utawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen), the second game in the series, launched in Japan in September 2015. The game's anime adaptation, Utawarerumono: The False Faces, debuted in October 2015. Crunchyroll streamed the series as it aired in Japan, and Sentai Filmworks released the series on home video.

Shiravune describes the game's story:    In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he encountered a girl he'd never met. The words the girl spoke were what shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man and the girl set out together towards the land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.   Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—    And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.

In addition, the game's official website revealed that the game will also ship in Japan on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on September 8. Shiravune is streaming an English-subtitled trailer for the game.      AQUAPLUS is also streaming the opening video and the teasers for the game.              Shiravune describes the game's story:    In the small province of Ennakamuy, on the frontiers of the great empire of Yamato, there lived a young man with his mother and sister. One day, at the local lord's behest, the young man was investigating a small irregularity when he encountered a girl he'd never met. The words the girl spoke were what shocked him: She told the man that his father was still alive. Seeing a trace of his father in her and resolving to learn the truth, the young man and the girl set out together towards the land of Arva Shulan—a country that doesn't appear on the map.   Faced with trials and perils, the boy chases his father. He meets new friends and comrades who join him on his mission. There will be struggles and victories and failures and partings. The fickle vagaries of fate will place an epoch in the young man's hands—    And one day, this man will be sung of in legends.    The game celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Utawarerumono franchise. Utawarerumono franchise head writer Suga Munemitsu is credited for the game's original concept and script. The artist mi is designing the characters. Franchise character designers Tatsuki Amazuyu and Misato Mitsumi are credited for original character designs.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

First impressions for Yui is really solid, and I had to do a spit take on the fact she carried Rosemary back home over her shoulder!      wolf10 wrote:        Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Anyway, all I was trying to point out is that spoiler[Mari is constructed to fit into a very specific archetype that basically any Japanese viewer (especially parents watching along) will recognize as having very specific implications, maybe even laugh at, even if a few traits are absent on account of this being a kids' show. The feminine name, the makeup, the exposed masculine neckline, the exaggerated speech pattern (which might be lost on non-speakers, but it can get pretty grating). It's really not the same as earnest, authentic gay, trans or enby representation. I say again, there are onee characters I like in spite of the stereotype, and as a consequence I'm still cautiously optimistic for Rosemary (much ass is kicked in this episode), but I think it's important to acknowledge that there's baggage there that didn't need to be.]   But honestly, it's Pretty Cure.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

I don't feel like repeating myself anymore, or restating anything else from the blog post I Googled, (because this is honestly kind of exhausting) but I would suggest doing more research of your own if you want to know more and have an informed opinion. As of this week, Rosemary is still toeing a line he didn't need to just by being here, but is doing fine on his own merits as a character. (Hopefully my reasons for the pronoun are clear.)

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.

Also hoping that Mari can regain his powers, since having someone else inside the fight with the girls would be pretty refreshing. Either way, really enjoying this season so far. Excited to see the rest of the girls introduced properly over the next coming weeks. Monster designs are also pretty fantastic.

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.           Haven't seen any of those, but by the almighty power of Youtube, and keeping in mind this is all the opinion of just one person...   Only Francois even comes close, but the outfit and name are two conscious attempts to distance from the stereotype. I would put down ""gay fashion designer"" as a much lesser evil.   Shut is... just kind of hot actually.   Subculture-appropriate male garb (with boots I kind of want now), and the combination of feminine speech pattern with a decidedly masculine vocal performance creates a nice tinge of androgyny while maintaining an appropriate threat-level for a recurring enemy. Queer villainy is a completely different conversation that I refuse to have here.   Henri (aka spoiler[Cure Infini]) is exactly as fantastic and progressive (and non-stereotype) as I had hoped, so that's still a franchise win in my books. No notes.   So what the hell is DPP playing at? I'm guessing/hoping Mari is some kind of benevolent-but-misguided attempt to redeem the stereotype. The hyper-competent onee is a newer iteration that shaves off the in-universe comedic incompetence while still having them perform for the audience's approval (i.e. Anesagi from IDOLiSH7). It should be safe to like him on his own merits, but I'll still be on edge over past burns by characters like Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI (""Sylvia"" in the original Japanese), who had one decent subplot about his overbearing father, but also another (in XI S) where spoiler[he went around turning men gay, and by the end they were all talking like him and shrieking ""onee-sama"" all the time]. Yikes. This was in 2019.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

First impressions for Yui is really solid, and I had to do a spit take on the fact she carried Rosemary back home over her shoulder!      wolf10 wrote:        Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Saeryen wrote:    *snip*           I try to let my views speak for themselves without my orientation coming into play, but since you asked: I am a gay man, and I do appreciate a strong makeup game. I also collect toys, and have a Cure Moonlight figure I would set up in my cubicle but I just know someone's kid is going to run off with it when I'm not in the office.   Anyway, all I was trying to point out is that spoiler[Mari is constructed to fit into a very specific archetype that basically any Japanese viewer (especially parents watching along) will recognize as having very specific implications, maybe even laugh at, even if a few traits are absent on account of this being a kids' show. The feminine name, the makeup, the exposed masculine neckline, the exaggerated speech pattern (which might be lost on non-speakers, but it can get pretty grating). It's really not the same as earnest, authentic gay, trans or enby representation. I say again, there are onee characters I like in spite of the stereotype, and as a consequence I'm still cautiously optimistic for Rosemary (much ass is kicked in this episode), but I think it's important to acknowledge that there's baggage there that didn't need to be.]   But honestly, it's Pretty Cure. This is the exact opposite kind of conversation I wanted to be having. I want to talk food and positivity and healing. Marvel at the sakuga. Maybe pick up a few recipes.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

Stereotype. Please use the word. I was just trying to raise awareness.

The stereotype in question was created to de-legitimize gay men as men by turning them into ""women."" Many gay men take pride in still being men, even as they put on makeup and engage in other activities considered ""un-masculine,"" even doing drag. But the onee stereotype was created to take all of that and exaggerate it into an obsession with beauty, even a desire towards womanhood, all so insecure straight men don't feel threatened. It's a kind of audiovisial harassment aimed at gay men, where the real harm is done simply by checking enough of the boxes to reinforce existing associations.   I don't feel like repeating myself anymore, or restating anything else from the blog post I Googled, (because this is honestly kind of exhausting) but I would suggest doing more research of your own if you want to know more and have an informed opinion. As of this week, Rosemary is still toeing a line he didn't need to just by being here, but is doing fine on his own merits as a character. (Hopefully my reasons for the pronoun are clear.) I could really do with less of the ""look at how accepting we are of the funny queer,"" but at least it's not the focal point of the episode... Oh, wait, it kind of is, but hopefully Toei have gotten it out of their system.   (It's never addressed directly, but Miyano from Sasaki and Miyano having a strong negative association linking ""liking men"" to ""not being a man"" is almost certainly because of the onee stereotype. tl;dr: backhanded ""positive"" representation can still be harmful.)

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.  I liked the face he made when Yui showed up and learned it was the watch that tracked him down and him holding his own in battle was a nice touch.

Also hoping that Mari can regain his powers, since having someone else inside the fight with the girls would be pretty refreshing. Either way, really enjoying this season so far. Excited to see the rest of the girls introduced properly over the next coming weeks. Monster designs are also pretty fantastic.

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.           Haven't seen any of those, but by the almighty power of Youtube, and keeping in mind this is all the opinion of just one person...   Only Francois even comes close, but the outfit and name are two conscious attempts to distance from the stereotype. I would put down ""gay fashion designer"" as a much lesser evil.   Shut is... just kind of hot actually.   Subculture-appropriate male garb (with boots I kind of want now), and the combination of feminine speech pattern with a decidedly masculine vocal performance creates a nice tinge of androgyny while maintaining an appropriate threat-level for a recurring enemy. Queer villainy is a completely different conversation that I refuse to have here.   Henri (aka spoiler[Cure Infini]) is exactly as fantastic and progressive (and non-stereotype) as I had hoped, so that's still a franchise win in my books. No notes.   So what the hell is DPP playing at? I'm guessing/hoping Mari is some kind of benevolent-but-misguided attempt to redeem the stereotype. The hyper-competent onee is a newer iteration that shaves off the in-universe comedic incompetence while still having them perform for the audience's approval (i.e. Anesagi from IDOLiSH7). It should be safe to like him on his own merits, but I'll still be on edge over past burns by characters like Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI (""Sylvia"" in the original Japanese), who had one decent subplot about his overbearing father, but also another (in XI S) where spoiler[he went around turning men gay, and by the end they were all talking like him and shrieking ""onee-sama"" all the time]. Yikes. This was in 2019.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

First impressions for Yui is really solid, and I had to do a spit take on the fact she carried Rosemary back home over her shoulder!      wolf10 wrote:        Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Anyway, all I was trying to point out is that spoiler[Mari is constructed to fit into a very specific archetype that basically any Japanese viewer (especially parents watching along) will recognize as having very specific implications, maybe even laugh at, even if a few traits are absent on account of this being a kids' show.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

I could really do with less of the ""look at how accepting we are of the funny queer,"" but at least it's not the focal point of the episode... Oh, wait, it kind of is, but hopefully Toei have gotten it out of their system.   (It's never addressed directly, but Miyano from Sasaki and Miyano having a strong negative association linking ""liking men"" to ""not being a man"" is almost certainly because of the onee stereotype. tl;dr: backhanded ""positive"" representation can still be harmful.)

Also hoping that Mari can regain his powers, since having someone else inside the fight with the girls would be pretty refreshing. Either way, really enjoying this season so far. Excited to see the rest of the girls introduced properly over the next coming weeks. Monster designs are also pretty fantastic.

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.           Haven't seen any of those, but by the almighty power of Youtube, and keeping in mind this is all the opinion of just one person...   Only Francois even comes close, but the outfit and name are two conscious attempts to distance from the stereotype. I would put down ""gay fashion designer"" as a much lesser evil.   Shut is... just kind of hot actually.   Subculture-appropriate male garb (with boots I kind of want now), and the combination of feminine speech pattern with a decidedly masculine vocal performance creates a nice tinge of androgyny while maintaining an appropriate threat-level for a recurring enemy. Queer villainy is a completely different conversation that I refuse to have here.   Henri (aka spoiler[Cure Infini]) is exactly as fantastic and progressive (and non-stereotype) as I had hoped, so that's still a franchise win in my books. No notes.   So what the hell is DPP playing at? I'm guessing/hoping Mari is some kind of benevolent-but-misguided attempt to redeem the stereotype. The hyper-competent onee is a newer iteration that shaves off the in-universe comedic incompetence while still having them perform for the audience's approval (i.e. Anesagi from IDOLiSH7). It should be safe to like him on his own merits, but I'll still be on edge over past burns by characters like Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI (""Sylvia"" in the original Japanese), who had one decent subplot about his overbearing father, but also another (in XI S) where spoiler[he went around turning men gay, and by the end they were all talking like him and shrieking ""onee-sama"" all the time]. Yikes. This was in 2019.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine.

Also hoping that Mari can regain his powers, since having someone else inside the fight with the girls would be pretty refreshing. Either way, really enjoying this season so far. Excited to see the rest of the girls introduced properly over the next coming weeks. Monster designs are also pretty fantastic.

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.           Haven't seen any of those, but by the almighty power of Youtube, and keeping in mind this is all the opinion of just one person...   Only Francois even comes close, but the outfit and name are two conscious attempts to distance from the stereotype. I would put down ""gay fashion designer"" as a much lesser evil.   Shut is... just kind of hot actually.   Subculture-appropriate male garb (with boots I kind of want now), and the combination of feminine speech pattern with a decidedly masculine vocal performance creates a nice tinge of androgyny while maintaining an appropriate threat-level for a recurring enemy. Queer villainy is a completely different conversation that I refuse to have here.   Henri (aka spoiler[Cure Infini]) is exactly as fantastic and progressive (and non-stereotype) as I had hoped, so that's still a franchise win in my books. No notes.   So what the hell is DPP playing at? I'm guessing/hoping Mari is some kind of benevolent-but-misguided attempt to redeem the stereotype. The hyper-competent onee is a newer iteration that shaves off the in-universe comedic incompetence while still having them perform for the audience's approval (i.e. Anesagi from IDOLiSH7). It should be safe to like him on his own merits, but I'll still be on edge over past burns by characters like Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI (""Sylvia"" in the original Japanese), who had one decent subplot about his overbearing father, but also another (in XI S) where spoiler[he went around turning men gay, and by the end they were all talking like him and shrieking ""onee-sama"" all the time]. Yikes. This was in 2019.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

First impressions for Yui is really solid, and I had to do a spit take on the fact she carried Rosemary back home over her shoulder!      wolf10 wrote:        Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.

At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.            I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Anyway, all I was trying to point out is that spoiler[Mari is constructed to fit into a very specific archetype that basically any Japanese viewer (especially parents watching along) will recognize as having very specific implications, maybe even laugh at, even if a few traits are absent on account of this being a kids' show. The feminine name, the makeup, the exposed masculine neckline, the exaggerated speech pattern (which might be lost on non-speakers, but it can get pretty grating). It's really not the same as earnest, authentic gay, trans or enby representation. I say again, there are onee characters I like in spite of the stereotype, and as a consequence I'm still cautiously optimistic for Rosemary (much ass is kicked in this episode), but I think it's important to acknowledge that there's baggage there that didn't need to be.]   But honestly, it's Pretty Cure. This is the exact opposite kind of conversation I wanted to be having. I want to talk food and positivity and healing. Marvel at the sakuga. Maybe pick up a few recipes.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

Stereotype. Please use the word. I was just trying to raise awareness. ""Well I don't see why that's a problem so you shouldn't either,"" is, in fact, a very common response in such discussions, so your response is not unexpected, but really, this is the last time I want to have to say anything on it.   The stereotype in question was created to de-legitimize gay men as men by turning them into ""women."" Many gay men take pride in still being men, even as they put on makeup and engage in other activities considered ""un-masculine,"" even doing drag. But the onee stereotype was created to take all of that and exaggerate it into an obsession with beauty, even a desire towards womanhood, all so insecure straight men don't feel threatened. It's a kind of audiovisial harassment aimed at gay men, where the real harm is done simply by checking enough of the boxes to reinforce existing associations.   I don't feel like repeating myself anymore, or restating anything else from the blog post I Googled, (because this is honestly kind of exhausting) but I would suggest doing more research of your own if you want to know more and have an informed opinion. As of this week, Rosemary is still toeing a line he didn't need to just by being here, but is doing fine on his own merits as a character. (Hopefully my reasons for the pronoun are clear.) I could really do with less of the ""look at how accepting we are of the funny queer,"" but at least it's not the focal point of the episode... Oh, wait, it kind of is, but hopefully Toei have gotten it out of their system.   (It's never addressed directly, but Miyano from Sasaki and Miyano having a strong negative association linking ""liking men"" to ""not being a man"" is almost certainly because of the onee stereotype. tl;dr: backhanded ""positive"" representation can still be harmful.)

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.  I liked the face he made when Yui showed up and learned it was the watch that tracked him down and him holding his own in battle was a nice touch.

Also hoping that Mari can regain his powers, since having someone else inside the fight with the girls would be pretty refreshing. Either way, really enjoying this season so far. Excited to see the rest of the girls introduced properly over the next coming weeks. Monster designs are also pretty fantastic.

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.           Haven't seen any of those, but by the almighty power of Youtube, and keeping in mind this is all the opinion of just one person...   Only Francois even comes close, but the outfit and name are two conscious attempts to distance from the stereotype. I would put down ""gay fashion designer"" as a much lesser evil.   Shut is... just kind of hot actually.   Subculture-appropriate male garb (with boots I kind of want now), and the combination of feminine speech pattern with a decidedly masculine vocal performance creates a nice tinge of androgyny while maintaining an appropriate threat-level for a recurring enemy. Queer villainy is a completely different conversation that I refuse to have here.   Henri (aka spoiler[Cure Infini]) is exactly as fantastic and progressive (and non-stereotype) as I had hoped, so that's still a franchise win in my books. No notes.   So what the hell is DPP playing at? I'm guessing/hoping Mari is some kind of benevolent-but-misguided attempt to redeem the stereotype. The hyper-competent onee is a newer iteration that shaves off the in-universe comedic incompetence while still having them perform for the audience's approval (i.e. Anesagi from IDOLiSH7). It should be safe to like him on his own merits, but I'll still be on edge over past burns by characters like Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI (""Sylvia"" in the original Japanese), who had one decent subplot about his overbearing father, but also another (in XI S) where spoiler[he went around turning men gay, and by the end they were all talking like him and shrieking ""onee-sama"" all the time].

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.  I liked the face he made when Yui showed up and learned it was the watch that tracked him down and him holding his own in battle was a nice touch.

Also hoping that Mari can regain his powers, since having someone else inside the fight with the girls would be pretty refreshing. Either way, really enjoying this season so far. Excited to see the rest of the girls introduced properly over the next coming weeks. Monster designs are also pretty fantastic.

I guess he's a bit more goofy, but I find him entertaining.           Haven't seen any of those, but by the almighty power of Youtube, and keeping in mind this is all the opinion of just one person...   Only Francois even comes close, but the outfit and name are two conscious attempts to distance from the stereotype. I would put down ""gay fashion designer"" as a much lesser evil.   Shut is... just kind of hot actually.   Subculture-appropriate male garb (with boots I kind of want now), and the combination of feminine speech pattern with a decidedly masculine vocal performance creates a nice tinge of androgyny while maintaining an appropriate threat-level for a recurring enemy. Queer villainy is a completely different conversation that I refuse to have here.   Henri (aka spoiler[Cure Infini]) is exactly as fantastic and progressive (and non-stereotype) as I had hoped, so that's still a franchise win in my books. No notes.   So what the hell is DPP playing at? I'm guessing/hoping Mari is some kind of benevolent-but-misguided attempt to redeem the stereotype. The hyper-competent onee is a newer iteration that shaves off the in-universe comedic incompetence while still having them perform for the audience's approval (i.e. Anesagi from IDOLiSH7). It should be safe to like him on his own merits, but I'll still be on edge over past burns by characters like Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI (""Sylvia"" in the original Japanese), who had one decent subplot about his overbearing father, but also another (in XI S) where spoiler[he went around turning men gay, and by the end they were all talking like him and shrieking ""onee-sama"" all the time]. Yikes. This was in 2019.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

First impressions for Yui is really solid, and I had to do a spit take on the fact she carried Rosemary back home over her shoulder!      wolf10 wrote:        Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Which is to say, wow, that was eye-popping. This is such a strong premiere I don't even know where to start except to agree with everything in the review. Oishiina Town is, as it's name suggests, delicious.   There's really just one sour note messing with the flavor profile right now: spoiler[I really, really could have lived without making this season's fairy kingdom advisor an onee. (Relevant reading for context.) I respect any and all attempts to spin it as some kind of positive (neutral?) representation, but it's still an old, disrespectful stereotype that conflates ""gay"" and ""transgender"" and enforces rigid expectations of masculinity. Way to squander all the goodwill earned by Hugtto. (As much as I adore Anesagi from IDOLiSH7, Mari-chan has yet to wow me in the same way. There's still plenty of time.)] Mini-rant over. Sorry I'm always such a downer.     Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.         I'm also hoping for some justice for my boy Seiji from HappinessCharge. At least it seems like they'll be playing the childhood friend romance straight this time instead of aiming for a (misguided) triple-subversion.

Honestly Rebecca said so much already that I agree with so I don't have much to add. I love Yui and Rosemary already.   The only thing I kinda disagree with is the assertion that Cure Waffle wasn't a real Pretty Cure, because I will always say he is and you can't change my mind. Even if they don't call Takumi a Pretty Cure he's one too.

First impressions for Yui is really solid, and I had to do a spit take on the fact she carried Rosemary back home over her shoulder!      wolf10 wrote:        Quote:    And yes, I admit that I'm excited by the possibility that Yui's friend Takumi could be a Pretty Cure simply because it would be justice for Cure Waffle, who absolutely should have been a thing in Kira Kira Pretty Cure a la Mode.

I always figured the ""mysterious white stranger"" will be more of a Tuxedo Mask kind of support character. Though if he is considered a ""Precure"" with his own transformation sequence and stock attack animation, that would be quite bold. And yeah, the whole Seiji thing in Happiness Charge was really badly handled (among a lot of other things of that season) so improvement on that front would be appreciated.

Anyway, all I was trying to point out is that spoiler[Mari is constructed to fit into a very specific archetype that basically any Japanese viewer (especially parents watching along) will recognize as having very specific implications, maybe even laugh at, even if a few traits are absent on account of this being a kids' show. The feminine name, the makeup, the exposed masculine neckline, the exaggerated speech pattern (which might be lost on non-speakers, but it can get pretty grating). It's really not the same as earnest, authentic gay, trans or enby representation. I say again, there are onee characters I like in spite of the stereotype, and as a consequence I'm still cautiously optimistic for Rosemary (much ass is kicked in this episode), but I think it's important to acknowledge that there's baggage there that didn't need to be.]   But honestly, it's Pretty Cure. This is the exact opposite kind of conversation I wanted to be having. I want to talk food and positivity and healing. Marvel at the sakuga. Maybe pick up a few recipes.

Sure, Mari fits into the archetype, but an archetype or trope is not necessarily bad in itself. Usually the worst parts are the implications, which would be the characters of similar archetypes that are more predatory, and used with greater cynicism. See Case File n221 Kabukicho, which was pretty shocking for a few characters. But then you have Kanamori/Venus from Heaven's Design Team, who is a pretty clear trans woman, and yet the show was never cynical of her identity as a woman who is often preoccupied with beauty.   For at least at this point, Rosemary is pretty androgynous, or even feminine, regardless of their build itself being more masculine. I know that you said that something like this is not as good as a 'real' enby character, but I would say that at least some part of positive breaking the gender binary is preferable to none, and even some preference over a character that just has a big question mark put on them as a joke.

Game Review   by Todd Ciolek, Apr 23rd 2022       Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Nintendo Switch                     Description:             Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon.

Review:         Description:        Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.     Review:            There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters, better animation, and smoother play than any 8-bit system could manage. Are they neo-retro? Noveau 8-bit? Nostalgia traps? Whatever the movement might be called, Gotta Protectors was there at the start, with Protect Me Knight in 2010 and Gotta Protectors in 2016. And now Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness arrives on the Switch so thick with retro attachment that the initial screen mimics a fuzzy TV signal, while the game itself wastes few screens before its princess protagonist squeals that her castle is moving ""faster than a hedgehog on blast processing."" If that sparks a grin of recognition, Gotta Protectors is for you.    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them?  As it turns out, plenty.     The realm of Magicadia is one of those unfortunate kingdoms rarely not under siege by evil forces, as Princess Lola and her lineup of eight loyal guardians learn at the opening of Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness. As with previous games, the princess must be defended from onslaughts of hostile foes, yet their new quest brings an offensive push. Instead of just sitting in her castle, Lola rides it along railroad tracks to reach the enemy stronghold. And then she gleefully slams her fortress into the enemy castle until her target explodes in a mushroom cloud. Princess Lola is clearly a go-getter.    To defend the princess on her castle-train journey, the player picks three of the Gotta Protectors and fends off a furious horde of creatures. Switching out with a simple command, the heroes span familiar archetypes with humorous touches; the short-range fighter, spell-hurling mage, and long-range archer play it relatively straight, but the ninja speeds around in merely a mask and a loincloth, the unflatteringly named Oldguy lumbers forth with a toy horse bolted around his waist, and the shaman-like oracle wears a candle headband and a constant expression of guilty, wild-eyed terror.     There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks. If you want to play defensively, you can erect barriers to slow down enemies, who'll busy themselves pouncing on the roadblocks while you plan your next move or simply strike at your foes. And if the barricades are damaged, you can fix them by attacking them—just like in real life.     Gotta Protectors is similarly calculated in its appearances. The characters and enemies are small and simple in design, but it's all so the game can cram as many characters as possible into the playfield without a hint of slowdown. It's easy to lose sight of a hero in the chaos of goblin throngs, glowing minotaurs, flying arrows, bursting spells, and the constant power-up cheers of the princess and her locomotive castle. Yet even if you're confused, the game offers quick solutions. When in doubt, button-mashing will usually get you through. Perhaps a little too often.    Slamming attacks into hundreds of enemies per stage is repetitive at first, but again Gotta Protectors builds things up. With three characters on your team, it's best to go for the variety of standard attackers, long-range projectile experts, and one of the less easily pigeonholed characters like the Oracle or Prince. Each mission brings in cash that can be used to upgrade your defense, attack power, barricade sturdiness, or the power of the princess herself. Unfortunately, those stat boosts disappear after each four-part mission, dismantling any level-ups you've purchased.     Long-term satisfaction lies elsewhere. Save your money, and you can upgrade characters' actual abilities in a fairy-run shop. Each Gotta Protectors hero has several stock playstyles that carry over once purchased, and you're free to make a custom profile with your favorite acquired moves. It brings great variety to the gameplay, even if you're only allowed three characters in battle.    Gotta Protectors is rarely lacking in cute style, whether it's the pleasantly detailed graphics assembled by programmers with decades of experience, the punchy soundtrack from industry legend Yuzo Koshiro, or just the characters quibbling. Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl. Instead, Gotta Protectors is reminiscent of Game Center CX and its DS titles, paying constant and humorous tribute to an era while still standing on its own.     The game openly invites multiplayer at all times, with three spare slots at the screen's top even when you're playing solo. It's only more hectic with other characters on the playfield, and that's entirely the point. Having other heroes along to help and annoy each other patches up the occasional monotonous attacking, and the online play seemed smooth at this writing.    Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness carefully and forcefully looks back to the days of the NES and Famicom, and that's hardly a rare aim these days. Yet there's much more to the game than the overloaded trappings of an 8-bit game too technically impressive to have actually existed back then. It's refreshingly complicated and relentlessly charming despite some repetition, and that earns it a wide-reaching recommendation, even for those players who won't get the joke in an NES-like cartridge called “Hoagie's Aisle.”             Grade:      Overall : B+ Graphics : A- Sound/Music : B Gameplay : B+ Presentation : B+  + Lovingly detailed pixel art, a perfect sense of humor, enjoyable battles both solo and in multiplayer − Combat is occasionally tedious, upgrade system resets too often            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                       Game Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Review:         Description:        Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.     Review:            There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters, better animation, and smoother play than any 8-bit system could manage. Are they neo-retro? Noveau 8-bit? Nostalgia traps? Whatever the movement might be called, Gotta Protectors was there at the start, with Protect Me Knight in 2010 and Gotta Protectors in 2016. And now Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness arrives on the Switch so thick with retro attachment that the initial screen mimics a fuzzy TV signal, while the game itself wastes few screens before its princess protagonist squeals that her castle is moving ""faster than a hedgehog on blast processing."" If that sparks a grin of recognition, Gotta Protectors is for you.    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them?  As it turns out, plenty.     The realm of Magicadia is one of those unfortunate kingdoms rarely not under siege by evil forces, as Princess Lola and her lineup of eight loyal guardians learn at the opening of Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness. As with previous games, the princess must be defended from onslaughts of hostile foes, yet their new quest brings an offensive push. Instead of just sitting in her castle, Lola rides it along railroad tracks to reach the enemy stronghold. And then she gleefully slams her fortress into the enemy castle until her target explodes in a mushroom cloud. Princess Lola is clearly a go-getter.    To defend the princess on her castle-train journey, the player picks three of the Gotta Protectors and fends off a furious horde of creatures. Switching out with a simple command, the heroes span familiar archetypes with humorous touches; the short-range fighter, spell-hurling mage, and long-range archer play it relatively straight, but the ninja speeds around in merely a mask and a loincloth, the unflatteringly named Oldguy lumbers forth with a toy horse bolted around his waist, and the shaman-like oracle wears a candle headband and a constant expression of guilty, wild-eyed terror.     There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks. If you want to play defensively, you can erect barriers to slow down enemies, who'll busy themselves pouncing on the roadblocks while you plan your next move or simply strike at your foes. And if the barricades are damaged, you can fix them by attacking them—just like in real life.     Gotta Protectors is similarly calculated in its appearances. The characters and enemies are small and simple in design, but it's all so the game can cram as many characters as possible into the playfield without a hint of slowdown. It's easy to lose sight of a hero in the chaos of goblin throngs, glowing minotaurs, flying arrows, bursting spells, and the constant power-up cheers of the princess and her locomotive castle. Yet even if you're confused, the game offers quick solutions. When in doubt, button-mashing will usually get you through. Perhaps a little too often.    Slamming attacks into hundreds of enemies per stage is repetitive at first, but again Gotta Protectors builds things up. With three characters on your team, it's best to go for the variety of standard attackers, long-range projectile experts, and one of the less easily pigeonholed characters like the Oracle or Prince. Each mission brings in cash that can be used to upgrade your defense, attack power, barricade sturdiness, or the power of the princess herself. Unfortunately, those stat boosts disappear after each four-part mission, dismantling any level-ups you've purchased.     Long-term satisfaction lies elsewhere. Save your money, and you can upgrade characters' actual abilities in a fairy-run shop. Each Gotta Protectors hero has several stock playstyles that carry over once purchased, and you're free to make a custom profile with your favorite acquired moves. It brings great variety to the gameplay, even if you're only allowed three characters in battle.    Gotta Protectors is rarely lacking in cute style, whether it's the pleasantly detailed graphics assembled by programmers with decades of experience, the punchy soundtrack from industry legend Yuzo Koshiro, or just the characters quibbling. Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl. Instead, Gotta Protectors is reminiscent of Game Center CX and its DS titles, paying constant and humorous tribute to an era while still standing on its own.     The game openly invites multiplayer at all times, with three spare slots at the screen's top even when you're playing solo. It's only more hectic with other characters on the playfield, and that's entirely the point. Having other heroes along to help and annoy each other patches up the occasional monotonous attacking, and the online play seemed smooth at this writing.    Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness carefully and forcefully looks back to the days of the NES and Famicom, and that's hardly a rare aim these days. Yet there's much more to the game than the overloaded trappings of an 8-bit game too technically impressive to have actually existed back then. It's refreshingly complicated and relentlessly charming despite some repetition, and that earns it a wide-reaching recommendation, even for those players who won't get the joke in an NES-like cartridge called “Hoagie's Aisle.”             Grade:      Overall : B+ Graphics : A- Sound/Music : B Gameplay : B+ Presentation : B+  + Lovingly detailed pixel art, a perfect sense of humor, enjoyable battles both solo and in multiplayer − Combat is occasionally tedious, upgrade system resets too often            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                       Game Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks.

Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl. Instead, Gotta Protectors is reminiscent of Game Center CX and its DS titles, paying constant and humorous tribute to an era while still standing on its own.     The game openly invites multiplayer at all times, with three spare slots at the screen's top even when you're playing solo. It's only more hectic with other characters on the playfield, and that's entirely the point. Having other heroes along to help and annoy each other patches up the occasional monotonous attacking, and the online play seemed smooth at this writing.    Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness carefully and forcefully looks back to the days of the NES and Famicom, and that's hardly a rare aim these days. Yet there's much more to the game than the overloaded trappings of an 8-bit game too technically impressive to have actually existed back then. It's refreshingly complicated and relentlessly charming despite some repetition, and that earns it a wide-reaching recommendation, even for those players who won't get the joke in an NES-like cartridge called “Hoagie's Aisle.”             Grade:      Overall : B+ Graphics : A- Sound/Music : B Gameplay : B+ Presentation : B+  + Lovingly detailed pixel art, a perfect sense of humor, enjoyable battles both solo and in multiplayer − Combat is occasionally tedious, upgrade system resets too often            discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:                       Game Review homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.      Review:         Description:        Princess Lola and the Gotta Protectors defend their realm against legions of monsters, this time by using their castle itself as a mobile weapon. Of course, they're still armed with blades, bows, magic, barricades, and other stranger methods of attack, as they'll need every armament when the screen's crammed with hostile creatures.     Review:            There's no shortage of modern creations that evoke the look and sound of late 1980s games. Not so much as those games actually were, but as players fondly remember them—with bigger characters, better animation, and smoother play than any 8-bit system could manage. Are they neo-retro? Noveau 8-bit? Nostalgia traps? Whatever the movement might be called, Gotta Protectors was there at the start, with Protect Me Knight in 2010 and Gotta Protectors in 2016. And now Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness arrives on the Switch so thick with retro attachment that the initial screen mimics a fuzzy TV signal, while the game itself wastes few screens before its princess protagonist squeals that her castle is moving ""faster than a hedgehog on blast processing."" If that sparks a grin of recognition, Gotta Protectors is for you.    But what about the players who don't have fond memories or excessive fixations surrounding that particular era of video games? What does Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness offer them?  As it turns out, plenty.     The realm of Magicadia is one of those unfortunate kingdoms rarely not under siege by evil forces, as Princess Lola and her lineup of eight loyal guardians learn at the opening of Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness. As with previous games, the princess must be defended from onslaughts of hostile foes, yet their new quest brings an offensive push. Instead of just sitting in her castle, Lola rides it along railroad tracks to reach the enemy stronghold. And then she gleefully slams her fortress into the enemy castle until her target explodes in a mushroom cloud. Princess Lola is clearly a go-getter.    To defend the princess on her castle-train journey, the player picks three of the Gotta Protectors and fends off a furious horde of creatures. Switching out with a simple command, the heroes span familiar archetypes with humorous touches; the short-range fighter, spell-hurling mage, and long-range archer play it relatively straight, but the ninja speeds around in merely a mask and a loincloth, the unflatteringly named Oldguy lumbers forth with a toy horse bolted around his waist, and the shaman-like oracle wears a candle headband and a constant expression of guilty, wild-eyed terror.     There's an undeniable charm to the mixture of simple appearances and complex details in Gotta Protectors. It's there in the stages themselves, which start off with basic tasks as the heroes ferry the princess onward and beat back enemies. But then the opposition expands from pushover goblins to include swooping bats, bomb-throwing bears, warping succubi, buzzing grim reapers, clustering zombies, and the occasional giant crab or equally oversized creature.    The stages grow in similar fashion, gradually introducing switches to change the castle's path, gates that must be unlocked, pits that only a hero can bridge, and other gimmicks that transform each level into an fast-paced puzzle. It's fitting, then, that the heroes have more than their attacks. If you want to play defensively, you can erect barriers to slow down enemies, who'll busy themselves pouncing on the roadblocks while you plan your next move or simply strike at your foes. And if the barricades are damaged, you can fix them by attacking them—just like in real life.     Gotta Protectors is similarly calculated in its appearances. The characters and enemies are small and simple in design, but it's all so the game can cram as many characters as possible into the playfield without a hint of slowdown. It's easy to lose sight of a hero in the chaos of goblin throngs, glowing minotaurs, flying arrows, bursting spells, and the constant power-up cheers of the princess and her locomotive castle. Yet even if you're confused, the game offers quick solutions. When in doubt, button-mashing will usually get you through. Perhaps a little too often.    Slamming attacks into hundreds of enemies per stage is repetitive at first, but again Gotta Protectors builds things up. With three characters on your team, it's best to go for the variety of standard attackers, long-range projectile experts, and one of the less easily pigeonholed characters like the Oracle or Prince. Each mission brings in cash that can be used to upgrade your defense, attack power, barricade sturdiness, or the power of the princess herself. Unfortunately, those stat boosts disappear after each four-part mission, dismantling any level-ups you've purchased.     Long-term satisfaction lies elsewhere. Save your money, and you can upgrade characters' actual abilities in a fairy-run shop. Each Gotta Protectors hero has several stock playstyles that carry over once purchased, and you're free to make a custom profile with your favorite acquired moves. It brings great variety to the gameplay, even if you're only allowed three characters in battle.    Gotta Protectors is rarely lacking in cute style, whether it's the pleasantly detailed graphics assembled by programmers with decades of experience, the punchy soundtrack from industry legend Yuzo Koshiro, or just the characters quibbling. Princess Lola and her companions touch on everything from sequel pitfalls to self-censorship jokes, and during gameplay they'll uncover little game cartridges with suspiciously familiar titles like “Balloon Fright” and “Jujitsu X.”     Even the interstitials are strewn with callbacks: pausing the game brings mock-ups of magazines, and title cards show fictional and often absurd fan art (including a piece apparently from singer and The Wizard star Jenny Lewis). It's a constant flow of in-jokes, but it's never an empty reference parade like Ready Player One or Hi Score Girl.

Thre volumes, I guess? Two have been released so far, the second one in November.   I'm kind of interested in this but didn't want to start reading until I knew how long it would be... I didn't care much for Nabari no ou (I think it went on for too long and the Yoite stuff ended up being sentimental to the point of emotional porn for my taste), and I wasn't much interested in Shimanami tasogare. But I liked the underlying ideas in both, and I like it here as well, so I hope that with a bit tighter control and less time for excesses of sentimentality it will be a better experience for me.

Thre volumes, I guess? Two have been released so far, the second one in November.   I'm kind of interested in this but didn't want to start reading until I knew how long it would be... I didn't care much for Nabari no ou (I think it went on for too long and the Yoite stuff ended up being sentimental to the point of emotional porn for my taste), and I wasn't much interested in Shimanami tasogare. But I liked the underlying ideas in both, and I like it here as well, so I hope that with a bit tighter control and less time for excesses of sentimentality it will be a better experience for me.

The Final Stroke Film at #4   posted on 2022-04-26 15:25 UTC-8 by Adriana Hazra         25th Detective Conan film stays at #1; Cherry Magic!, Doraemon, Mr. Osomatsu also in top 10    Detective Conan: The Bride of Halloween (Meitantei Conan: Halloween no Hanayome), the 25th anime film in the Detective Conan franchise, stayed at #1 in its second weekend. The film earned 894,350,450 yen (about US$6.98 million) from Friday to Sunday, and has earned a cumulative total of 3,648,466,350 yen (about US$28.5 million). The film has sold 2.54 million tickets so far.    The film opened in Japan on April 15 and sold 1,321,944 tickets for 1,907,467,150 yen (about US$15.06 million) in its first three days. The film earned 1% more in its first three days than the previous record-holding film (for total earnings) in the franchise, Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, in its first three days.    Susumu Mitsunaka (Haikyu!!) directed the film at TMS Entertainment. Takahiro Ōkura (Detective Conan: Fist of Blue Sapphire, Detective Conan: The Crimson Love Letter) wrote the screenplay. Gosho Aoyama was credited for the original work. Yūgo Kanno (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, Psycho-Pass) composed the music for the film. BUMP OF CHICKEN performed the film's theme song ""Chronostasis.""    The movie takes places in Shibuya on Halloween. At the Shibuya Hikarie building, a certain wedding ceremony is taking place. There, Miwako Sato is in a wedding dress. Suddenly, an intruder bursts in, and Wataru Takagi is injured protecting Miwako. At the same time, the serial bombing criminal from the incident three years ago that killed Jinpei Matsuda (whom Miwako was in love with) escapes. Rei Furuya, who used to be a classmate of Jinpei's at the police academy, tracks the culprit down, but a mysterious costumed person appears and attaches a collar bomb to his neck.

At the same time, the serial bombing criminal from the incident three years ago that killed Jinpei Matsuda (whom Miwako was in love with) escapes. Rei Furuya, who used to be a classmate of Jinpei's at the police academy, tracks the culprit down, but a mysterious costumed person appears and attaches a collar bomb to his neck.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu   Apr  1st 2022                   How would you rate episode 25 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These - Collision (movies) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.

Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).

The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn.

At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting. Then both sides call in reinforcements and it just snowballs. It's a pointless meatgrinder of a battle. Nothing will change based on who wins or loses. By the time Yang shows up with a fleet so massive that retreat is the only option for the Empire, pretty much every fighter pilot besides Julian is dead—and the one other newbie who made it through is on the edge of a mental break.    It's great stuff full of drama that explores the nature of the human soul—or to put it another way, it's an average episode of The Legend of Galactic Heroes.

Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Following the resolution of their respective civil wars, the conflict between the Free Planets Alliance and the Galactic Empire has resumed in earnest. Julian Mintz, adopted son of Yang Wen-Li, enlists in the Alliance military and, while being trained during a routine patrol, finds himself caught up in a conflict with a passing Empire fleet. Under the command of Dusty Attenborough, the Alliance soldiers struggle to hold their ground until Yang can send reinforcements, as Julian and his fellow recruits struggle to adapt to the realities of being thrust into real combat for the first time.    Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Gekitotsu is the third season of the new anime of Yoshiki Tanaka's epic science fiction novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Three years later we're back with another set of new Legend of the Galactic Heroes movies, with Crunchyroll once again chopping them up and releasing them as weekly episodes. Granted, it's more likely the other way around, as just with the pacing of the previous 'season', this first episode pretty clearly functions as an isolated half-hour that is connected with a greater whole as any piece of serialized storytelling. And it means there's enough focus in this premiere episode to bring us back into the story of all these Galactic Heroes, with just enough passing remarks on the status quo to remind us of how we got here (Though given the storied history-book density of LOGH, it might not hurt to at least go back and peruse some synopses for the preceding plot. It has been three actual years after all).    Helping to ease us into all that is the fact that this one has a relatively narrower, smaller-scale focus than LOGH adventures previously tended to end up with. The real-world-style march of time in this galaxy sees Yang's young ward Julian formally enlist in the Alliance military, and it's through his eyes that we get back to engaging with the focal conflict of this series. It comes off as a brisk, concentrated re-introduction to things, where instead of focusing on Reinhard or his consolidations in the Empire, we get a bunch of flashbacks to Julian's training and details of what he's been put through up until this first battle he finds himself in. They do also throw in some informational setup for future long-term developments of this arc (there's a reason a class question prompts a whole spiel from Julian about warp technology), but otherwise this is firmly a story about seeing the war through the fresh eyes of a rookie and their feelings of contrast with the various flavors of veteran we know exist in the LOGH ranks.    That's all well and good in terms of directly defining Julian as we follow him in this new stage of his life and the show's plot, but it does also have the side effect of the series feeling given to over-explaining its tones at every turn. There's basically no time to see Julian reflect on his situation on his own; each point has to be punctuated by a conversation with someone else in this establishment. For instance, the episode sends Dusty down to just have this detailed, emotional conversation with Julian in-between fighting where the kid directly exposits all his thoughts and feelings about the battle he was just in. The episode ends with Julian's rookie-in-arms Peter rambling about the complexities of experience and survivor's guilt in relation to the deaths of their more experienced comrades, when the following simple, solemn shot of Julian looking up at his instructor's name on the listing of the deceased communicates that same impact much more effectively in a moment. If you've been keeping up with this LOGH adaptation this long, these kinds of overt sensibilities aren't really surprising, but it's still mildly annoying to see them still in place, even as the series shows inklings of knowing how to do more with less.    Thankfully, a lot of the appreciable little touches of LOGH persist here. I love the bit where Dusty relates a funny anecdote to the bridge crew and they all laugh, despite being in the middle of a heated battle. Similarly, the idea that ostensibly-inexperienced fighter-pilot movements would cause Empire officers to second-guess their approaches because they're used to going up against Yang's galaxy-brain strategies is a fun acknowledgement of how far reputation for the main characters has come at this point in the story. And it's all presented with the now-expected glossy finish of this modern animated adaptation, making the most of the opportunity to open with an episode that features a bunch of zippy space-ship dogfights. Some of its less-welcome adaptational flourishes persist, but this is still recognizably Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and it's still nice to have more of it.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                One of the great things about space operas is the size of their stories. Here we have the start of a new season, with one of our warring protagonists suffering from the tragic death of a close friend and the other having just crushed a rebellion full of people he respected. Yet this episode touches on none of that—our main characters barely even make an appearance. Rather, it is a largely self-contained “boots on the ground” story from the front lines centering on the first deployment of Yang Wen-li's adoptive son, Julian.    Julain is in a unique position. While he is intelligent and brave, he stands in the shadow of the Alliance's greatest hero. Instead of being jealous of this fact, he is humbled and wants to be of use to his adopted father. But how do you support a man like that? By becoming a fighter pilot, Julain has decided to be Yang's eyes on the front. His personal struggle over the episode is one of ego, learning to accept the victories and the losses without letting them go to his head or force him into despair.    At the same time, the whole episode is a graphic example of the futility of war. What we watch is a meaningless battle: two patrolling fleets that run into each other and start fighting.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Dawn of the Witch   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.

Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered.

So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.

26-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/the-dawn-of-the-witch/.183529,The Dawn of the Witch - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of The Dawn of the Witch ?                     Community score: 3.5              What is this?   The world is now at peace after having endured a conflict between the church and witches for 500 years. However, embers of war still burn in some regions of the world. Cervil is a hopeless student at the Kingdom of Wenias' College of Magic. Cervil has somehow lost all memory of his time before attending the college. The school's headmaster Albus sends him for special training to the southern part of the continent, where persecution against witches runs strong.    The Dawn of the Witch is based on Kakeru Kobashiri's light novel series and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Dawn of the Witch did not make the best first impression on me. We're deep into premiere season, it's late, I'm tired, etc, and I'm out of patience for shows that introduces its female characters either thighs/crotch first or tits first. I have zero familiarity with Grimoire of Zero, and while this is a standalone spinoff, I definitely got the nagging feeling I was supposed to be familiar with at least a few of these faces.    Once I was ready to forgive the show its trespasses, I did actually find a lot to draw me in. The story starts at a magic academy in a region where magic is accepted, thanks to the end of a war several centuries ago. However, since there are still places where mages are treated as other, the academy's best student, worst student, and a 300-year-old witch with the body of a ten-year-old and garter-clad thighs are going on what boils down to a humanitarian mission to build a safe home for them. Oh, and Saybil, the worst student, needs this mission to be successful, or else he'll lose what memories he's accumulated since developing amnesia three years ago.    It's a decent sentiment with a good heart, and I was surprised by a clunky-but-well-intentioned moment when Saybil called his travel companion out on her microaggressions against their beastfallen classmate. And yet, it just doesn't quite gel. Not because the fan service was particularly obtrusive—other than those crotch-first and boob-first intros, it was actually quite low-key—but because there's just no chemistry between the characters. There was a lot of walking and talking, camping and talking, and so on, and I just wasn't having fun watching them banter. There wasn't much sense of a connection and any playfulness felt forced.    Maybe someone who already knows and likes Grimoire of Zero will get more out of Dawn of the Witch. For me, it feels like wasted potential.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                While I've never felt the need to go back and rewatch the Grimoire of Zero, I do have fond memories of the little witch and her giant teddy bear of a mercenary. So returning to this world, with or without Zero in the drivers seat, is a lot of fun. There are a lot of familiar faces (it's great to see Albus all grown up) and it's interesting to see how everything has progressed since the last time we were here.    As fun as all the connections are, the basic story is perfectly understandable even if you've never seen Grimoire of Zero. Our viewpoint character, Saybil, is an amnesic magic student (though, in a twist on the trope, the memory loss happened three years previously). His personal conflict is simple: he's the school's worst mage and if he can't improve he'll be kicked out of the academy. If this happens, his knowledge of magic will be erased from his mind—basically reverting him right back to his post-amnesia state.    Then we have the titular Dawn Witch herself, a 300-year-old with the body of a little girl. While I could do without the constant panty shots, she is an intriguing character. Though egotistical and entitled, she seems to have the wisdom to match. Her connection to her staff is likewise interesting—as is everyone's reactions to how she uses a witch-killing weapon for everyday menial tasks.    The only issue I had with the show is that it really needs to lay out some of its proper nouns and a bit more of its history. While terms like “mage” and “witch” are thrown about, we don't get any clear answer on the difference between them (if any exists). And while we know there was a war between witches and the church, a bit more of the specifics would help us understand the trouble our heroes have already found themselves in with the Witch Hunters. But, all in all, this episode lays some solid ground work and makes me want to see not only what is to come for Sable and Loux but how Zero is connected to everything as well.      James Beckett  Rating:                I feel a little embarrassed, because it wasn't more than a week ago that I suddenly found myself thinking, “Man, remember Grimoire of Zero?” I hadn't thought about the show in years, not since I reviewed it, but for some reason I found myself feeling ever so slightly nostalgic for the flawed but fun fantasy adventure. “I wonder whatever happened to that big ol' cat-man and his tiny witch girlfriend?” And yet, I was completely unaware going into Dawn of the Witch that this was actually a sequel to Grimoire of Zero, and it took me a minute to even realize it. I must have zoned out a little during the OP, since Zero and Mercenary make very clear and obvious appearances in it, but it was right around the part where a wolf-man named Holdem was yelling about a woman named Albus that I started to connect the dots.    Dawn of the Witch is a really direct sequel, as it turns out, despite jumping ahead a number of years in the timeline, not to mention the major shakeup in visual style on account of the new production team. I had to go back to watch the end of GoZ to refresh my memory, but that series does indeed end with young Albus starting up a brand-new magic academy in Wenias, and promising to build a world where witches and humans can live in peace. At the start of Dawn of the Witch, it seems like she's making headway on that goal, too, though there's still a long way to go. This is what gets our four main characters started on their journey, and it's also where my issues with Dawn of the Witch really take hold.    While it was surprisingly fun to catch up with this universe and see what's become of some of the characters since Grimoire ended, this premiere just doesn't do a great job of getting me to give a damn about its own story and cast. Saybil is a total nothing of a protagonist, and Loux is the grating and unlikable inverse of Zero. It doesn't help that the camera goes out of its way to zoom in on her crotch with absolutely no shame, or even a sense of proper framing. Holt and Kudo are barely developed outside of the fact that Holt is very busty and flirtatious with Saybil, which is odd considering that Saybil has no discernable personality whatsoever. Kudo is…a lizard. That's about it.    Nobody will ever mistake Grimoire of Zero for great television, and it says something that I went nearly five years before remembering that I spent a whole season watching and reviewing the show, but it was a decent fantasy anime all things considered. Dawn of the Witch hasn't elicited any reaction from me whatsoever, which is a very poor place for a series premiere to find itself in. Maybe the show will pick up once the new cast finds its footing, or if Zero and Mercenary return to liven up the proceedings. If that isn't the case, though, then Dawn of the Witch seems destined to be overshadowed by its older sibling, and it isn't like GoZ cast all that large of a shadow in the first place.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                If you weren't aware, The Dawn of the Witch is set in the same world as Grimoire of Zero, although I don't think that's any impediment to just jumping in here. There are probably some world-building elements that work better if you're familiar with Grimoire of Zero, and that particular book does get a mention in this episode, but it's otherwise a pretty standard sword-and-sorcery setup, with beastpeople (known as beastfallen), magic users, witch hunters, and a vaguely Medieval sensibility. Well, and there's the headmaster of a magic school named Albus, but maybe we won't dwell on that.    This episode suffers most from two things: being very much about setting the stage for the more interesting things to come and Loux being kind of annoying. Loux could be Beatrice's cousin from Re: Zero in some ways, and I do think the choice to use the archaic informal second person (thee/thou/thy) largely works for her attitude of superiority. She's absolutely the kind of person who would deliberately speak informally to everyone just to show that she considers herself above them, something that Hort and Saybil notice when she leaves them behind to go chase witch hunters. But she's the sort of character who could wear with length of use, which could be an issue if she's got too much time in the spotlight.    The fact that Loux is also used for the bottom half of the fanservice may also rub some people the wrong way. We get plenty of shots of her crotch as she sits with her legs splayed, which is mostly noticeable because of how ridiculous her skirt's design is. Hort takes over the top half of the fanservice with her shirt that's patterned so that her breasts look like a wrapped present, and it is kind of amusing how obviously the art is trying to have it all by the way Hort is always shown boobs-first while Loux is shown thighs-first. Mostly the issue is that Loux, despite being 300 years old, looks pretty darn prepubescent, because really, she can sit however is most comfortable for her. Not that Saybil notices any of this, being about as blank a slate as you can get and having no discernable personality whatsoever. It's frankly the least believable part of the episode that Hort likes him so much.    Mostly this episode just sort of exists. There are some hints that the story could improve once the tedious set up is finished, so this probably isn't one to just write off immediately. But on the other hand, Goodreads assures me that I've read the first volume of the manga version and I can't remember a darn thing about it. Make of that what you will.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               This show exists in a weird bit of adaptation limbo. It's based on a series of light novels that are themselves a sequel to the Grimoire of Zero novel series. I'm one of the 10 people who watched and still vaguely remember the 2017 Grimoire anime, but that show only covered the first couple volumes of a much longer story. So while I recognize some returning characters and understand the basic makeup of this particular fantasy world, I could not tell you how we got from the adventures of Tony the Tiger and his pint-sized witch gremlin to this new status quo. The good news is this is largely a new story, and anything immediately important is explained pretty quickly in this episode, so newcomers and non-LN readers alike should be able to follow along. The bad news is that doesn't make this episode any more interesting or entertaining.    The big issue with this new series is that it's centered on, by far, its least engaging character. Saybil's amnesia and mysterious past are supposed to entice you to learn more about him, but in practice he's a dead-eyed cipher who intakes exposition and outputs nothing of interest. Nearly any other character introduced here would be more engaging to follow as a protagonist, with the possible exception of the titular Witch of the Dawn, Loux. On top of being a 300-year-old little girl who can't stop flashing her panties to the camera, she's just an annoying presence who's only tolerable when she's acting her age instead of playing up her miniscule appearance. So the thought of watching her mentor our deadweight lead is deathly unappealing. That stands in stark contrast to Mercenary and Zero's dynamic in the first series, and it makes me question why these two are our leads when there's some perfectly engaging characters right next to them.    Maybe that's just because we barely get any time with Holt or Kudo so they don't have a chance to disappoint us, but just on the surface they both strike me as way more active, layered characters to build your story around. Holt is a star magic pupil who seemingly comes from a harsh background where she learned to put on a kind smile to avoid confrontation, which raises questions about her past that actually make her more interesting, unlike Saybil. Kudo, meanwhile, is a rough-mannered beast-man who nonetheless has a strong sense of justice and acts selflessly in his own way. Hell, just in this episode it's brought up that witches used to sacrifice beast-people, so the idea of one studying magic to become a witch is a rock-solid concept that all but begs for further exploration. Why, then, is his entire story this episode offscreen? Is has to be more interesting than watching our amnesiac sadboi hero vomit on a cart ride.    That's what really makes this premiere frustrating, on its own and as a follow-up to Grimoire of Zero. I know there's an interesting fantasy world behind all this, with a rich history just waiting to be explored, and presumably even more new things that have happened since the first anime wrapped up. If this were just some generic isekai world I could write it off as a dull waste of time and be done, but there's so much potential here that is just being left to rot. I might stick around for another episode or two, just to see if the elements I liked get some actual focus, but I can't give this much of a recommendation right now.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows.

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way.

As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.

When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him. It isn't until later that the bully, genuinely full of remorse, confesses that Ashito lashed out because he was defending his mother, who herself is a well-drawn character, a stern but obviously loving single parent who struggles to make ends meet in the backwater town that her family is stuck in. Outside of Tatsuya and Ashito, none of the other kids or adults have anything revolutionary going on, but it's clear that every person in this story has their own goals and dreams; they all feel very human.    I'll admit that, when the show gets way into the weeds with the soccer mechanics and whatnot, I found myself a little lost, but to Aoashi's credit, the training scenes and play-by-play recaps were at least comprehensible to me, despite the fact that I haven't played a game of soccer since the fourth grade. Besides, when the episode ended, I was honestly excited to see whether or not Ashito would succeed in the Tokyo tryouts and make it into Tatsuya's junior league team – which is a pretty high mark of excellence for a story like this, since we all know that Ashito has to succeed in some way or another for the plot to move forward. In short, Aoashi is a sports anime that can take well-worn tropes and archetypes and spin them into a product that still has heart, and that counts for a lot. Enough for me to give it a hearty recommendation, at least.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               On one level, Aoashi is very much like your run-of-the-mill sports anime. We have a naturally-talented protagonist in Ashito who believes if he tries hard enough, he can overcome anything. This, of course, has made him arrogant and self-centered—proudly proclaiming his skills to anyone who will listen. He's very much the biggest fish in a very small pond.    Luckily, that's not all there is to Ashito, and almost the entirety of this first episode is dedicated to demonstrating that. Despite his oversized ego, his time on his middle school team has taught him the importance of teamwork. He is well aware that the only reason he is able to make the plays he does is because everyone is working together to give him the openings he needs. And while he does have skills, he lacks training; one night with a high-level coach is enough to improve his game drastically, and he is driven enough to put the hard work in when challenged. But, as we discover, his true talent lies in his spatial awareness—an oft-overlooked but incredibly valuable skill in any team sport. Ashito knows not only exactly where his teammates are but where members of the opposing team are positioned as well. He is in the right place at the right time so often not due to luck, but because he makes sure he is there when the opening comes.    But, despite his love of soccer, Ashito has a shadow looming over his life: he's poor. Even though they are living out in the country, his single mother and older brother can barely provide for him on a daily basis. His ragged shoes are the perfect indicator of this. And its the fact that the opposing goalie bad- mouths his mother and their financial situation that causes him to lose his cool. A personal attack on him or even his team he can stand. One on the woman who is struggling to keep a roof over his head and food on the table? That's his breaking point.    It's not hard to feel for him when, even though he is actively being scouted to tryout for a team in Tokyo, he knows it is impossible. His mom explodes at him for even considering the idea, but it's clear that her anger isn't directed at him, but rather at her own perceived failure of not being able to follow up on the opportunities he has earned. It's heartbreaking. No good parent wants to see their child miss out on a chance like that, and while we know that he'll obviously get his shot and make the team (there wouldn't be much of an anime if he didn't), that doesn't make the drama any less effective or well-executed. If sports anime are your thing, you should probably give this one a try.      Rebecca Silverman  Rating:                It's tempting to simply slot Aoashi protagonist Ashito into the same slot as characters like Sakaki from Futsal Boys!!!!! and Kageyama from Haikyu!! – the guy who doesn't think that there are any other players on the team, and if there are, well, they're just around to make him shine brighter. And really, that's what most people seem to have thought about him from the get-go; he's got a reputation as a ball hog and, if that jerk kid on the other team is to be believed, that rep has gotten him booted off plenty of soccer teams in the past. We start to get a hint that such is not the case when he headbutts the jerk after what we're allowed to assume are imprecations against Ashito's current teammates, because if the other boys are just props for his glory, then why would he bother to defend them? But it turns out that that's misdirection as well, and the result is a first episode that manages to go just enough above and beyond to hook viewers to make it stand out among the other three sports shows (four, if you count Dance Dance Danseur, which is likely to run similarly to a sports show) airing this season.    Lest you think Aoashi is reinventing the wheel, it really isn't. It's still a story about a kid who loves his sport, is good at it, and dreams of playing on much larger stages. Mostly it's just got a bit more turmoil for its protagonist, which doesn't feel as manufactured as, say, Love All Play's drama. The two biggest barriers to Ashito's success are people's misconceptions about his playstyle and that his family simply doesn't have the money to fund his dreams. It's the latter actually sets him off – the jerk kid doesn't stop with insulting his teammates, he moves on to a particularly cruel blow about how poor the Aoi family is while making unkind insinuations about Ashito's mom. Ashito knows that he needs backing from someone else to be able to play at the level he wants to, and there's a sense that his devotion to the game is both from his love for it and because he has to get really, really good if he wants to attract the assistance he needs. And maybe there's a bit of an escape from his mother in there, too – she's clearly worn out and stressed, which comes across as mean, with older brother Shun stepping in to be the supportive figure in Ashito's life. But really, can you blame their mom for worrying?    I'm not thrilled with the way that the episode relies more on still shots than animated soccer action, but I think the story may make this worth following. It's varied the usual sports flavor just enough to make it stand out a bit, and while I don't care much about soccer, I am interested in seeing where Ashito's story takes him.     Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                It's Sports O'Clock again, and we're back at it with another show about young athletes following their dreams. This has been an inconsistent season for sports premieres, with Birdie Wing delivering some goofy fun and Love All Play not delivering much of anything. This soccer show, meanwhile, lands somewhere in the middle of those extremes. It's much more conventional (and less entertaining) than the underground golf clowns, but it's a heck of a lot more competent than the badminton boys.    Whether or not you enjoy this one is gonna come down to how much you like Ashito, our central, shouty soccer boy. I like to think I have a pretty high tolerance for loud-mouth shonen heroes who act before they think, but even I found myself getting annoyed by his constant yelling. Maybe it's just that his voice actor sounds really close to Natsuki Hanae's Tanjiro voice in Demon Slayer, and I'm just sick of that particular cadence. Either way, I found the circumstances around him a lot more engaging than the boy himself. It's interesting that he comes from a single-parent home, one that's struggling financially, and that does tangibly effect him. He's defensive of his mother and the (implied to be disreputable) work she does to feed him and his brother, and their financial situation means it's a lot harder for him to follow his big shonen dreams of soccer stardom. That's some good, solid drama that could help the show standout against countless other soccer shows.    And that's important, because basically everything else in this premiere is by-the-book sports anime material. You've got the unconventional coach with a tragic pro-sports backstory who happens upon our diamond in the rough main character. You've got Ashito doing an all-night training session in order to pass the arbitrary test said-coach assigned him. Really the only tweak to the formula is the reveal that Ashito is more aware and intelligent on the field than his seemingly spontaneous playstyle would suggest, and that'll only become important once he actually joins the Youth team in the coming episodes. We only get a few minutes of actual soccer being played, but it looks pretty solid – certainly better than Farewell, My Dear Cramer ever did – so that low bar has been cleared.    Overall, while there's some intriguing twists to Ashito's character, the rest of this feels like your standard sports fodder without a whole lot to draw you in. It's competent, successful even, but it doesn't inspire the same kind of excitement you can get from the best of these shows. If you have a love of soccer and a tolerance for loud anime boys, it may be worth your time.

26-04-2022,anime,7,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/aoashi/.183645,Aoashi - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"            How would you rate episode 1 of Aoashi ?                     Community score: 3.7              What is this?   Aoi Ashito is a third year middle school student from Ehime. Behind his raw game hides his immense talent but Ashito suffers a huge setback because of his overly straightforward personality. The youth team manager of J1 club Tokyo City Esperion, Fukuda Tetsuya, appears in front of Ashito. Fukuda sees Ashito's limitless potential and invites him to take part in his team's tryouts in Tokyo. The story of the boy who will revolutionize football in Japan rapidly begins to unfold. (from manga)   Aoashi is based on Yūgo Kobayashi's manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                Aoashi is the fourth sports anime to debut this season, and fortuitously enough, its arrival divides them into perfect even groups. Birdie Wing and Fanfare of Adolescence are anime-ass anime, cheerfully over the top and full of pretty people doing ridiculous things. Love All Play and Aoashi are on the more grounded end of the spectrum, focusing on promising young men with capabilities well within the range of real humans, recruited for their talents to join top teams in high school.    If you were to choose just one sports anime, I'd say go with Birdie Wing all the way. And then if you said, “No, that series is too goofy, give me something more realistic,” I'd say something mildly insulting about your taste because who doesn't want a clandestine mini-golf match where the opponent is wearing a clown mask? And then you'd say, “That's unnecessary and rude, Caitlin, because taste is subjective,” and you know what? You'd be right. So I'd say between Love All Play and Aoashi, the latter is certainly the more promising of the two, largely because Ashito is the more interesting of the two protagonists.    He's cut from a similar cloth to a lot of other sports protagonists: a big fish in a small pond, gifted but raw, and arrogant. Oh, and yelly. I think about half of his lines are screaming. He could easily have become obnoxious and unpleasant to watch, but he's also unusually self-aware, and thrives because he has teammates who aren't put off by his over-the-top confidence and instead work to support him. He's the second son of a single mother, who he loves dearly. It's the foundation of a decently compelling, flawed protagonist if he doesn't rub you the wrong way, but rest assured, he will rub some people the wrong way, both within the story and among the audience.    There's not a whole lot of actual soccer this episode, though. Ashito gets kicked out of his match at the start of the episode pretty quickly, and he spends the rest of the runtime practicing a particular technique solo on the beach. There's some talk of strategy and technique, but to be honest, as a non-sports watcher, it pretty much flew over my head. Or maybe I just wasn't interested enough to try to understand, but when it comes to entertainment value, those are effectively the same thing.    As was the case with its cohort, Aoashi's premiere is all table setting for the actual plot to get going. It's a perfectly acceptable start to a series I'm not particularly interested in.       James Beckett  Rating:               What a pleasant surprise this was! I love it when a sports anime can dish up satisfying drama off the field as well as on, and while it took me a while to warm up to Aoashi, I eventually found myself intrigued by Ashito Aoi's story. I imagine that this is a show that will play even better to folks that have an appreciation for the ins and outs of soccer, but if a total neophyte like me can get something out of Aoashi, then it must be doing something right.    At first, I was as little annoyed with Ashito, and I didn't expect to have much love for him as a protagonist. He's cocky, overbearing, and unapologetically self-centered in a way that is maybe too accurate to some of the teens I deal with in the real world on an everyday basis. Thankfully, though, Aoashi leans into Ashito's personality in a way that takes advantage of his flaws and strengths in an interesting way. Sure, he's got an ego the size of a Goodyear blimp, but he also has the skills to back it up, and his impromptu training session with Tatsuya later in the episode reveals that he isn't at all ungrateful or ignorant of his teammates' skills and efforts. He demands attention and priority on the field mostly because he knows he can play circles around anybody else, but his love for the sport itself seems very pure. This gives the kid a lot of room to grow over the course of the story, which bodes well for the future.    It also helps that the episode goes on to make Ashito much more sympathetic than he might seem at first glance, and all of the side-characters around him are well-developed enough to complement his story. When Ashito ruins the game (and his chances of getting recruited to a popular high school), it seems like he is doing the usual thing where he lets some bully's taunts about his skills get the better of him.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More     ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"
26-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"    The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Fanfare of Adolescence   Apr  3rd 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine.

The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant.

26-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/preview-guide/2022/spring/fanfare-of-adolescence/.183511,Fanfare of Adolescence - The Spring 2022 Preview Guide - Anime News Network:SEA,"                 How would you rate episode 1 of Fanfare of Adolescence ?                     Community score: 2.9              What is this?   There's a competitive, three-year horse racing academy that trains boys to become jockeys. Those who wish to enter must not only pass an academic test but a physical and fitness test as well. Yū Arimura is a former popular idol who becomes enamored with horse racing after seeing it for the first time, and wants to join the academy. Shun Kazanami was raised on an island, and only experienced horse races through radio broadcasts growing up. Amane comes from a high-class family in England, and his father is a former jockey. The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse.

The show follows these three 15-year-old boys and others at the academy.    Fanfare of Adolescence is an original anime and streams on Crunchyroll on Saturdays.      How was the first episode?    Caitlin Moore  Rating:                It's hard to believe we've gotten two such diametrically opposed sports anime in one day! While Love All Play was pure grounded realism, Fanfare of Adolescence leans to the opposite side of the spectrum, all high emotion and contrived drama. It stops just short of superpowers, although one of the characters does have a preternatural connection with horses. Which one is better depends pretty much entirely on your preferences, but I'm going to be real with you – neither is very good, albeit for different reasons.    Going in, I knew that one of the big challenges for Fanfare of Adolescence was going to be its animation. Horses are notoriously difficult to draw and even harder to animate, and modern anime have resorted to all kinds of shortcuts to get around this complication. They almost never look good and at times are even comically bad. But I figured, of course an anime about jockeying would figure something out! Recruit some talented animators who could draw their way around knobbly knees and long faces and bring some majesty to these beautiful creatures.    But then the first horse showed up and it was all awkward, uncanny CG and oh dear, this is not going to be a good-looking series at all, is it?    Not that it would be a good-looking show, even if Yuu's brain didn't explode into a LiSA Frank nightmare every time he thought about equids. There's a ton of bizarre camera angles, including shots of legs, crotch shots as characters cross their legs, and on-the-nose visual metaphors involving two paths going through the woods interrupted by visions of horses made out of cherry blossoms. No, seriously.    All of this is in favor of a supremely contrived plot. If Yuu has never been on a horse before, how the heck did he make it into jockey school? The script makes such a big deal about how hard the school is to get into, but is that just because of its standard entrance exam? Why is Waver Velvet one of his classmates? Why did cherry blossoms appear when Shun catches Yuu? Is this actually BL? Not that I'd be complaining if it was…    Fanfare of Adolescence operates on the same kind of logic as male idol shows, where nobody acts quite like a person and things happen just because rather than any kind of internal logic. It's silly, and while it should be a fun ride for the right kind of fan, I doubt it'll be a runaway success.        Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               Sports anime often begin with someone being charmed by a sport they know nothing about and being driven to learn it. Fanfare of Adolescence takes this common framework and makes it about the lead singer of a popular teen boy band who decides to throw away his career and become a jockey. It's a convenient, if somewhat ridiculous, setup that makes him both hated by the serious jockey students and eager to prove himself. It's not great but it works well enough for a first episode—and it helps that the other students feel like people rather than walking tropes.    What really got my eyes rolling, however, was the back half of the episode. That these kids, who are “serious” about becoming jockeys, know nothing about horses is pure insanity and hurts me on a deeply personal level. Everything they do in this episode is wrong at best and life-threatening at worst. The scene of Yuu and Shun galloping double as they try to catch the reins of a panicking racehorse had me livid—and that's before it's revealed that neither had even gotten on a horse before. It's so ludicrously stupid that I can't help but wonder if the writers had ever even talked to a person who had any experience with riding a horse before. Then comes all the layers of metaphysical bullshit—i.e., ghost horses and listening to the sounds of nature—and this couldn't have rubbed me the wrong way more.    And yet, despite all that, I don't regret watching this episode. For all its misconceptions about horseback riding, it is a master class in direction. Nearly every shot in this episode is visually interesting. What could have been a normal scene of Yuu walking down the street is instead enhanced by showing him reflected through convex mirrors. Massive wide shots are used to show when he is lost, and moments of extreme emotion are effectively conveyed through close-ups on his mouth. And that's before we get into the breathtaking beauty of the surreal moments of the episode. At this point, if Makoto Katō directed an anime about buttering toast I'd watch it. Add in a score penned by Hiroyuki Sawano and I am left torn. Is it possible to watch an anime with a story you hate just because you love everything else about it? I don't know, but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to find out.        James Beckett  Rating:               I'm going to have to use one of my ADHD Passes on this one, y'all. I'm on my meds, I swear, and I even had a half-cup of strong coffee just before watching Fanfare of Adolescence. I closed any distracting tabs, I avoided Wikipedia and Twitter at all costs, and I even put my phone in the other room. Even with my best-laid precautions, though, I had to restart this premiere three times just to get through the first ten minutes. My brain simply would not entertain the notion of being able to focus on Fanfare of Adolescence for more than a minute or two before it started to wander, keen on occupying my time with literally anything else. Twice, right around the time that the Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up guide our hero Yu past The World's Most Obvious Visual Metaphor, I got up to do chores.    I'm not into horse jockeying, personally, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to automatically dismiss a show for having depicting subject matter that doesn't specifically cater to my interests. I care about ice skating about as much as I care about horse sports, and that didn't stop me from loving the hell out of Yuri!!! on Ice. The problem with Fanfare of Adolescence is not that it is about a niche sport. The show simply makes the same mistake that a lot of really specific sports and hobby shows make: It assumes that, so long as the main gimmick is covered and you've got a cast of vaguely handsome anime boys (and girl) to throw at the screen, the audience won't notice that you've completely forgotten to come up with a decent story.    We're talking about a main character who is throwing away the life of a professional pop idol and abandoning his fame to pursue a career as a horse jockey. How on Earth does a guy like that end up being the least interesting member of a cast that is comprised of other guys whose only defining features are their hair styles? When the hilariously sincere Psychedelic Ghost Horse showed up, and I finally made it through to the second half of the episode, I was hoping I might at least get some kicks out of the show's unintentional camp factor, but no, we can't even trust a goofy acid-trip phantom to stick around long enough to keep things interesting.    Instead, once the not-drama of Yu's arrival at Horse School is over with, we're treated to the similarly terrifying Actual Living Horses that the boys (and gal) have to deal with, and I'll give Fanfare of Adolescence this much: Even if the CGI horses look really awkward, I was kind of excited to watch them get all spooked and run around a bunch. I knew it was too much to ask for one of them to legitimately kick one of the characters in the head, although my hopes were briefly raised when ol' Yu somehow got it in his head that he could win a game of chicken against a 600-pund behemoth with stones for feet. Still, if nothing else, the show about horse racing was kind enough to have the riders and horses actually do stuff for a bit, and that kept my brain distracted long enough for me to get through the rest of the premiere relatively unscathed.    I didn't hate Fanfare of Adolescence, but it's tone and style are diametrically opposed to my own sensibilities, and it's going to take a hell of a lot more than C-tier characters and cookie-cutter cliches to win me over. I'm sure it will be just the thing for some folks, though, which means that, with any luck. Psychedelic Ghost Horse may yet ride again.        Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               Let me start with what I really admire about this first episode: at the prestigious jockey academy our hero quits being an idol to attend, the token girl student is allowed to wear pants. That's right, her uniform is exactly like the boys' and no one is treating her ambitions as less than the boys' – in fact, they're much kinder to Eri than they are to Yu, the aforementioned former idol. It would have been so easy to take the typical anime road here and tart up her uniform, and that they didn't inclined me to take this a bit more seriously than I otherwise might have.    Although the phantom horse made out of sakura petals that guides Yu to the correct path to school is a bit much. As are the band-uniform look of the instructors, and Shun's preternatural nature skills that enable him to read the wind, stand motionless in the bow of a boat going full speed, and perfectly ride a horse for the first time ever while chasing another, spooked horse. There's definitely some imbalance in this episode, and that takes away from its more grounded moments, like the very real garbage poor Yu is getting for deciding to do something with his life that no one expected, and the body language of the horses. (Their ears, specifically.) It's hard to tell how closely this is going to stick to the realities of learning to work with and ride horses professionally and how much odd metaphysical stuff is going to get in the way of that.    The premise isn't bad, though, and it's not hard to get behind Yu's desire to do something different with his life. We can simultaneously see how he's very good at putting on a public face and how draining that is for him; one of his strongest moments in this episode is when he tells off the reporters at the end, preferring to be addressed by his real name instead of his stage name. His classmates' mixed reactions to his presence is also decently handled; most of them don't quite know what to do with him, while one is visibly annoyed by his presence, possibly suspecting that this is all some sort of publicity stunt. As with most sports shows, there are a lot of named characters all thrown at us right off the bat, but they're at least nicely color-coded for those of us with no memory for names. I don't love the look of the show, mostly because (ears aside) there's something just a little off about the way the horses are drawn and animated. This feels like a very middle-of-the-road introductory episode, and I suspect that your enthusiasm for horses may determine if you decide to follow it.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:                This show was going to have an uphill battle with me from the start. Not because of the premise – I'm not big on horse racing, sure, but I like sports stories and animals, so a series about horse jockeys certainly could be cool. No, my problem was with the title: Fanfare of Adolescence sounds like a fake, joke anime you'd see in a real show. It's flowery as hell without actually telling you anything about the story or characters, and you could stick the name on damn near any high school drama anime and it would fit just fine. It's a bad name and they should feel bad about it.    The other issue it ran into early on is that I just don't care about our main character's big conflict in this premiere. Arimura may be a perfectly nice guy with some ridiculous Horse Sense, but when his whole struggle is that he's suddenly quit being a super popular idol to become a horse jockey, and every piece of conflict through this episode is about the media hounding him, it's just hard to relate to any of it. I don't care about how his orientation is awkward because of all the press, or how some of his classmates think he's just doing this for attention. I want to see some gosh dang horses, racing or at rest, and get an idea of how all these characters relate to the creatures they'll presumably be working with for the whole season. Get to that instead of prefacing it with all this showbiz drama.    Thankfully, things do pick up a bit once a random accident sets a couple of horses loose, and our freshman jockeys have to try and wrangle them. It's certainly cliché, and the way it actually happens is rather ridiculous, but it lets us actually see the interesting part of this premise for the final few minutes of the premiere, at least. It's not exactly stunning material – Arimura and his new buddy ride a horse together, rein in a second, and have a hilariously over-the-top shiptease moment to cap it off – but it's a conflict I wouldn't find in any other sports show airing this season. And while the CG on the horses leaves something to be desired, it at least looks alright in motion and manages to sell the speed of the whole thing. It's a serviceable presentation of why you'd want to watch this show instead of any given show about cute anime boys in high school, and I wish the rest of this premiere had been more like it.    In all, the premiere evens out to being just sorta ok. It's not terrible, though it is fairly dull until somebody actually mounts a horse. The biggest flaw is that for all the focus on Arimura's character he doesn't really have much discernible personality, and his co-star is instantly more engaging as some kind of Horse Savant. I may stick around just to see if they can manage to leave the idol plotline behind after this, but for now it's iffy.

News Live-Action My Boyfriend in Orange Film's Trailer Reveals More Cast, Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-26 09:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Snow Man sings theme song ""Orange Kiss"" for July 18 film    The official website for the live-action film of Non Tamashima's My Boyfriend in Orange (Moekare wa Orange-iro) manga unveiled the full trailer and poster for the film on Tuesday. The trailer reveals and previews the film's theme song ""Orange Kiss"" by the idol group Snow Man, and also reveals new cast members for the film.          The new cast members include:     Jin Suzuki as Kōsei Himeno, Ebihara's colleague and rival  Shuhei Uesugi as Shinichirō Kazama, Ebihara's colleague  Hidaka Ukisho as Genki Kojima, Ebihara's subordinate   Yūta Furukawa as Kazuma Shindō, Ebihara's superior  Taiyu Fujiwara as Shūto Mitaka, Moe's classmate   Riko Nagase as Sayumi Kiritani, Moe's classmate    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:  Hot firemen, now in the world of shojo manga! High school student Moe has moved to a new town after the death of her father. Moe's already having enough trouble fitting into her new class as it is, so she's totally mortified when she ends up being “rescued” by local firefighter Kyōsuke during a fire drill … in front of all the kids at school. But the embarrassing incident might be a blessing in disguise, because gruff-but-kind Kyōsuke gives Moe the courage she needs to leap out of her comfort zone as she aims to leave her loner days behind. Not to mention she's soon falling head over heels for him … !  The film will open on July 18. Snow Man idol group member Hikaru Iwamoto and model Meru Nukumi star in the film as the firefighter Kyōsuke Ebihara and the high school student Moe Sasaki, respectively.    Shōsuke Murakami (live-action One Week Friends, Promise Cinderella) is directing the film, and Junpei Yamaoka (Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger, live-action Peach Girl, Honey So Sweet) wrote the script. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The manga launched in Kodansha's Dessert magazine in May 2016, and Kodansha published the 12th compiled volume on April 13. Kodansha Comics published the 11th volume in English in December.

News Live-Action My Boyfriend in Orange Film's Trailer Reveals More Cast, Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-26 09:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Snow Man sings theme song ""Orange Kiss"" for July 18 film    The official website for the live-action film of Non Tamashima's My Boyfriend in Orange (Moekare wa Orange-iro) manga unveiled the full trailer and poster for the film on Tuesday. The trailer reveals and previews the film's theme song ""Orange Kiss"" by the idol group Snow Man, and also reveals new cast members for the film.          The new cast members include:     Jin Suzuki as Kōsei Himeno, Ebihara's colleague and rival  Shuhei Uesugi as Shinichirō Kazama, Ebihara's colleague  Hidaka Ukisho as Genki Kojima, Ebihara's subordinate   Yūta Furukawa as Kazuma Shindō, Ebihara's superior  Taiyu Fujiwara as Shūto Mitaka, Moe's classmate   Riko Nagase as Sayumi Kiritani, Moe's classmate    Kodansha Comics is publishing the manga digitally in English, and it describes the story:  Hot firemen, now in the world of shojo manga! High school student Moe has moved to a new town after the death of her father. Moe's already having enough trouble fitting into her new class as it is, so she's totally mortified when she ends up being “rescued” by local firefighter Kyōsuke during a fire drill … in front of all the kids at school. But the embarrassing incident might be a blessing in disguise, because gruff-but-kind Kyōsuke gives Moe the courage she needs to leap out of her comfort zone as she aims to leave her loner days behind. Not to mention she's soon falling head over heels for him … !  The film will open on July 18. Snow Man idol group member Hikaru Iwamoto and model Meru Nukumi star in the film as the firefighter Kyōsuke Ebihara and the high school student Moe Sasaki, respectively.    Shōsuke Murakami (live-action One Week Friends, Promise Cinderella) is directing the film, and Junpei Yamaoka (Kishiryu Sentai Ryusoulger, live-action Peach Girl, Honey So Sweet) wrote the script. Shochiku is distributing the film.    The manga launched in Kodansha's Dessert magazine in May 2016, and Kodansha published the 12th compiled volume on April 13. Kodansha Comics published the 11th volume in English in December.

News Live-Action My Boyfriend in Orange Film's Trailer Reveals More Cast, Theme Song   posted on 2022-04-26 09:43 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda          Snow Man sings theme song ""Orange Kiss"" for July 18 film    The official website for the live-action film of Non Tamashima's My Boyfriend in Orange (Moekare wa Orange-iro) manga unveiled the full trailer and poster for the film on Tuesday.

High school student Moe has moved to a new town after the death of her father. Moe's already having enough trouble fitting into her new class as it is, so she's totally mortified when she ends up being “rescued” by local firefighter Kyōsuke during a fire drill … in front of all the kids at school. But the embarrassing incident might be a blessing in disguise, because gruff-but-kind Kyōsuke gives Moe the courage she needs to leap out of her comfort zone as she aims to leave her loner days behind. Not to mention she's soon falling head over heels for him … !  The film will open on July 18. Snow Man idol group member Hikaru Iwamoto and model Meru Nukumi star in the film as the firefighter Kyōsuke Ebihara and the high school student Moe Sasaki, respectively.
