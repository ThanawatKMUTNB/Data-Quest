News PlayStation Plus Relaunches with New Features, Tiers on June 1 in Japan, June 13 in Americas, June 22 in Europe   posted on 2022-04-23 02:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan    Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) announced on Friday that it will launch previously announced new features and tiers for its PlayStation Plus service on May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan, June 1 in Japan, June 13 in the Americas, and June 22 in Europe.    In addition, cloud streaming access will be expanded to the following locations for a total of 30 markets with cloud streaming access: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    The new features will allow players to access modern titles through the subscription service, as well as catalog titles from past PlayStation platforms. PlayStation Plus will also merge with SIE's PlayStation Now subscription service (PlayStation Now will no longer be available as a standalone service after the features launch).    The additional features are consistent with a previous report by Bloomberg in December 2021 of Sony planning to launch a service codenamed ""Spartacus"" that would rival Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service.    The new features and subscription plan tiers for PlayStation Plus include:     PlayStation Plus Essential: this service remains the same as the current PlayStation Plus service and is priced the same.      PlayStation Plus Extra: this service has the features from the Essential tier, as well as access to ""up to 400"" PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that are downloadable to play.      PlayStation Plus Premium: this service has the features from the previous two tiers, as well as access to ""up to 340"" more games such as PlayStation 3 games for cloud streaming; PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games for download and/or streaming; the ability to stream games through PS4, PS5, and PC; and time-limited game trials on some games.    Players can pay for the subscription tiers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The Essential tier costs US$9.99 monthly, US$24.99 quarterly, or US$59.99 yearly. The Extra tier costs US$14.99 monthly, US$39.99 quarterly, or US$99.99 yearly. The Premium tier costs US$17.99 monthly, US$49.99 quarterly, or US$119.99 yearly.    Sony will offer markets without cloud streaming availability a separate third tier at a lower price that does not include any cloud streaming options.    PlayStation Plus is required for many online multiplayer games, and the service also offers several free games each month. PlayStation Now allows subscribers to stream or download older games.    Xbox Game Pass is a service that allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games without needing to individually purchase them. The service launched in June 2017, and is also available for PC.

News PlayStation Plus Relaunches with New Features, Tiers on June 1 in Japan, June 13 in Americas, June 22 in Europe   posted on 2022-04-23 02:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan    Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) announced on Friday that it will launch previously announced new features and tiers for its PlayStation Plus service on May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan, June 1 in Japan, June 13 in the Americas, and June 22 in Europe.    In addition, cloud streaming access will be expanded to the following locations for a total of 30 markets with cloud streaming access: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    The new features will allow players to access modern titles through the subscription service, as well as catalog titles from past PlayStation platforms. PlayStation Plus will also merge with SIE's PlayStation Now subscription service (PlayStation Now will no longer be available as a standalone service after the features launch).    The additional features are consistent with a previous report by Bloomberg in December 2021 of Sony planning to launch a service codenamed ""Spartacus"" that would rival Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service.    The new features and subscription plan tiers for PlayStation Plus include:     PlayStation Plus Essential: this service remains the same as the current PlayStation Plus service and is priced the same.      PlayStation Plus Extra: this service has the features from the Essential tier, as well as access to ""up to 400"" PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that are downloadable to play.      PlayStation Plus Premium: this service has the features from the previous two tiers, as well as access to ""up to 340"" more games such as PlayStation 3 games for cloud streaming; PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games for download and/or streaming; the ability to stream games through PS4, PS5, and PC; and time-limited game trials on some games.    Players can pay for the subscription tiers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The Essential tier costs US$9.99 monthly, US$24.99 quarterly, or US$59.99 yearly. The Extra tier costs US$14.99 monthly, US$39.99 quarterly, or US$99.99 yearly. The Premium tier costs US$17.99 monthly, US$49.99 quarterly, or US$119.99 yearly.    Sony will offer markets without cloud streaming availability a separate third tier at a lower price that does not include any cloud streaming options.    PlayStation Plus is required for many online multiplayer games, and the service also offers several free games each month. PlayStation Now allows subscribers to stream or download older games.    Xbox Game Pass is a service that allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games without needing to individually purchase them.

News PlayStation Plus Relaunches with New Features, Tiers on June 1 in Japan, June 13 in Americas, June 22 in Europe   posted on 2022-04-23 02:00 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan    Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) announced on Friday that it will launch previously announced new features and tiers for its PlayStation Plus service on May 23 in Asian markets excluding Japan, June 1 in Japan, June 13 in the Americas, and June 22 in Europe.    In addition, cloud streaming access will be expanded to the following locations for a total of 30 markets with cloud streaming access: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.    The new features will allow players to access modern titles through the subscription service, as well as catalog titles from past PlayStation platforms. PlayStation Plus will also merge with SIE's PlayStation Now subscription service (PlayStation Now will no longer be available as a standalone service after the features launch).    The additional features are consistent with a previous report by Bloomberg in December 2021 of Sony planning to launch a service codenamed ""Spartacus"" that would rival Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass service.    The new features and subscription plan tiers for PlayStation Plus include:     PlayStation Plus Essential: this service remains the same as the current PlayStation Plus service and is priced the same.      PlayStation Plus Extra: this service has the features from the Essential tier, as well as access to ""up to 400"" PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles that are downloadable to play.      PlayStation Plus Premium: this service has the features from the previous two tiers, as well as access to ""up to 340"" more games such as PlayStation 3 games for cloud streaming; PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable games for download and/or streaming; the ability to stream games through PS4, PS5, and PC; and time-limited game trials on some games.    Players can pay for the subscription tiers on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. The Essential tier costs US$9.99 monthly, US$24.99 quarterly, or US$59.99 yearly. The Extra tier costs US$14.99 monthly, US$39.99 quarterly, or US$99.99 yearly. The Premium tier costs US$17.99 monthly, US$49.99 quarterly, or US$119.99 yearly.    Sony will offer markets without cloud streaming availability a separate third tier at a lower price that does not include any cloud streaming options.    PlayStation Plus is required for many online multiplayer games, and the service also offers several free games each month. PlayStation Now allows subscribers to stream or download older games.    Xbox Game Pass is a service that allows users to pay a monthly subscription fee to access a library of games without needing to individually purchase them. The service launched in June 2017, and is also available for PC.

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be.

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie Episodes 1-2  by Mercedez Clewis, Apr 20th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.9                  How would you rate episode 2 of Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie ?                     Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance. (My favorite queer-adjacent romance is naturally Kakegurui. It's also, unsurprisingly, my favorite queer drama, and if you stretch it, also my favorite queer romcom too.)    This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty. Together, they play off of one another, supporting each other and just generally being heckin' cute. It makes for this genuinely interesting back and forth comparison that… sadly, isn't quite there yet in terms of being compelling.    In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be. (Also, the localization choices are pretty dang choice, which is easily one of the things to stick around for for sure!)

In fact, it's kind of just okay, which feels quite cutting to admit on what is now my second watch of this premiere.    And that's really my biggest takeaway from episode 1, a premiere so… tepid, dare I say that I actually found it remarkable for how middle of the road it is. Sure, there's jokes and they're solid enough, but so much of this first episode feels like it should be a third episode. There's this gap that kicks in during the back half that made me wonder, “Wait, was I not paying attention?” because there's an intimacy between the friends—that is, between Shikimori and her aptly colorful hair crew—that… sat strangely. Still, it's enticing enough that I kinda wanna get to know these kids a bit better, just to settle into the intimacy of a group of good kiddos.    That all said, episode 2, “Wind and Clouds, Ball Sports Tournament!” is kinda where its at, giving Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a burst of momentum early on so it    A lot of the front half of the episode is the same old, same old: Izumi-san's terse relationship with gravity—and the simple fact that Murphy's Law seems to absolutely want this kid to eat it- gets him immediately into trouble when a soccer ball goes flyin', slamming straight into Izumi's face. And at base, this isn't anything unusual: I feel like it's a time-honored (and very good) trope to have a nurse office visit in a romcom. What made this a bit different for me was the fact that we get a taste—nay, a small sampling—of why ShikIzumi (that is, Shikimori x Izumi) has the potential to be quite compelling, and it's done in a simple scene of Shikimori tending to him.    At base, the joke of clumsy boy and cool girl… isn't enough to carry the story. But there was something about seeing Shikimori and Izumi relaxed together, loving one another and being really, really tender that sunk its hooks into me. If I had to pinpoint what did it, it was just how much Izumi really loves Shikimori and how utterly cool he thinks she is. Basically, I'm caught up, hook, line, and sinker, and I imagine that if there's more tender, earnest moments of them just really loving each other, I'll continue to feel much the same, even if the show at large isn't “compelling” quite yet. That said, I'm definitely willing to wait for it to become the show that I think I see it having the potential to become.    I think it's fair to say that Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is having a conversation with gender norms: how deep that conversation will go remains to be seen, though I'm going to preemptively lower my own expectations to “it's probably not going to be subversive” which is alright. I don't think I subverted a single thing at sixteen: I don't expect these kids, nor the source material it draws on, to be doing heavy lifting on Japan and its entanglement with binary gender expectations.    My feelings about everything feeling like it's a bit later in the series still remained true as the credits rolled for episode 2, but I think that's by proxy of this story starting with the couple already established versus spending its cour building up the “will they, won't they?” aspect. Here, that's non-existent. Rather, we get to see the aftermath of that in all its nicely animated glory. And truly, there's something fascinating about a series where the confession is said and done: it's a nice vehicle to a pleasant, low-stakes story about a cool girl and her clumsy boy. So often, anime love stories end with the finale focused on the confession and acceptance of love. In my experience, I haven't gotten the joy of a series where the couple is already a couple: I've gotten heaps of series where the couples occur very early on, but never a series where episode 1 opens with the couple already a couple. In that, Shikimori's Not a Cutie has already won me over. I think it's just adjusting my standards and meeting the series where it is. (And maybe picking up the manga as well.)    As a fan of pink-purple haired couples (or in Wotakoi's case pink-blue couples) I'm here for Shikimori and Izumi. If this show never becomes bigger than the sum of its parts, I still think I'll have found a quite earnest show that seems to be playing with what it means to be in a relationship, as well as how genuinely passionate and charming teenage love can actually be.

Community score: 3.8            Every anime season, there's a handful of romcoms that get made. The one that immediately came to mind are Fall/Autumn 2020's TONIKAWA: Over The Moon For You, a show that made such a serious impression on me that two years later, I'm hankerin' for a second cour. Oh, and also Spring 2018's Wotakoi, a show that definitely informs a double-digit part of my personality and equally deserves a second cour. Basically, I love love: I'm the kind of person who, after 30+ viewings, easily says that The Proposal featuring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Renolds is my favorite m/f romance.

This season, one of the ones I'm sitting with is Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie a show so curious to me that I couldn't help but request to review it. Why?    Well, you see I've been looking for a romcom to make my entire personality, and while there's some solid candidates, I'm willing to stake my next three months on Shikimori and the potential for some gender non-conforming antics, starting with episode 1, “My Girlfriend is Super Cute.”    Episode 1 is what all premieres are: table setting to get you introduced to the cast. In this case, we start off with Izumi, the world's most hapless boy who happens to be pink-haired beauty Shikimori's boyfriend. Together, they make something of an odd couple, especially when you realize that Shikimori's charm point isn't her trope-ish beauty but the fact that she's hella smooth, when given the chance to be.    In fact, this forms the backbone of two of the series jokes: Izumi is clumsy and Shikimori is actually quite cool, inclusive of her beauty.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          7 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 7 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.     discuss this in the forum (4 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4, 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-ingram-73542921/': 1}"

The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime.

Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them.

26-04-2022,anime,10,0,https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2020/vcrx-we-translate-your-anime-and-more-panel-report/.163775,VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report - Anime News Network:SEA,"      VCRX 2020: We Translate Your Anime & More Panel Report   by Callum May, Sep  8th 2020          There's been a lot of discussion lately regarding conditions for localization workers within anime and manga. Despite them being essential to the popularity of anime in the west, they are often paid unlivable rates and go uncredited. Crunchyroll is just one of the companies where both of these issues persist.    The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent.

The panel appears to somewhat lampshade these issues, opening with a clip of the Dark Souls bonfire while a voice-over states, “If you're looking for internet drama or trouble, sorry friend. You won't find it here. If that upsets you, then I suggest you just move on to the next panel.” If this is the panel's attempt at dismissing labor issues, that's disappointing, but it's kept vague enough to ensure plausible deniability for this Crunchyroll industry panel.    The panel itself is hosted by Bryan Ingram, the senior director of production at Crunchyroll. Ingram's been with MX Media (now owned by Crunchyroll) since the start and served as “right-hand man” to its founder Ken Hoinsky. Ingram serves as an entertaining and competent host of the panel, but his position makes the dynamic somewhat awkward. Questions regarding the “hustle” of trying to survive as an independent contractor hit differently when those questions are being asked by your boss.    But if you can put the cynicism aside, this is genuinely a great panel and an annual opportunity for Crunchyroll translators to discuss their work. And while the opening's flippancy is disheartening, it's not the panellist's responsibility to address the accusations levelled at the company. At the same time, they do address the realities of working in the industry as both translators and independent contractors.    Featured translators Rei Miyasaka (top-left), Michelle Tymon (top-right), Adam Lensenmayer (bottom-left), and Sriram Gurunathan (bottom-right). Senior director of production Bryan Ingram appeared in voice-only.   The first topic was the obvious one: COVID-19. While anime fans have been disappointed by all the delays, the effect on translators was disastrous. Adam Lensenmayer mentioned that last season, he was working on fewer shows than he has in his entire 12-year career. Lensenmayer works with several anime streaming companies but doesn't depend on translation for his regular income. He said that if he was relying on anime translation, he'd probably have left the industry. Likewise, Gurunathan was also looking into other jobs, and regarded last season as a famine. Thankfully the number of shows have recovered in this fall season.    To describe the panel in one word, it would be: sobering. The translators made no effort to romanticize their anime work and spoke to their efforts in getting enough work to put food on the table. Each translator had a different experience with this, with Miyasaka advertising, Gurunathan cold-calling, Tymon received offers, and Lensenmayer took every available job, even the low-paying ones, in the hopes of finding a better one.    Lensenmayer's philosophy of taking every job also applies to the anime industry. He states that, “with any single client, you're very much subject to things outside of your control.” There's always shake ups within the anime licensing industry, and decisions from executives can leave translators without work. “If you are only attached to that one licensor,” he said, “it will have a very negative effect on your income.” So to keep his overall earnings up, Lensenmayer opted to work with as many licensors as possible.    This seems to be the key to a lot of translation work in the anime-games space. It's important not to rely too much on it. A lot of translators will supplement their income with business or research translation, or even just have a regular 9-5 job. When asked how they get more money out of translation, the panellists seemed to be generally unconcerned. Miyasaka mentioned that there are issues with translation work going down in price due to the increase in available translators and more companies relying on machine translation. Tymon noted that she was offered more from long-time clients over time.      The translators are introduced with their credits and original illustrations of them (except Gurunathan)   Translators are usually paid based on the length of an episode, but the value of that can be hilariously inconsistent. Each translator was asked what their quickest and longest translation was, and while Tymon stated an average of 3-4 hours, she noted that this time could easily double if extra research is necessary. “As a translator, you usually become a mini-expert in something pretty quickly so research is really important,” she stated. On the most extreme end of this spectrum is Gurunathan who spoke about having to spend three days on just the first half of Episode 269 of Gintama. The episode features Gintoki teaching a child history through the use of Japanese mnemonics. Gurunathan would then have to find a way of expressing these in English. As Gurunathan put it, “Translation is 20% actual translating and 80% problem-solving.”    And because of this, the shows that don't involve complex dialogue can be translated surprisingly quickly. Tymon noted that for an action-heavy show, she might only take 1.5-2 hours to translate the episode. Lensenmayer even recalled a time when he managed to translate three episodes of Casshern Sins within an hour. Since the show had such little dialogue, he'd just have all the episodes on his screen playing at the same time. Whenever a character talked, he'd pause them and translate the line. It's clear that this tactic wouldn't work for most shows, though.    While translators generally wouldn't employ Lensenmayer's strategy, most of the panellists did note some form of time-saving technique. Sometimes this involves asking other translators for help and sometimes it just involves creating a library of different software to speed up the process. Miyasaka created a service that compiles multiple English-Japanese dictionaries amusingly titled HugeDict. Each of the dictionaries offers different information and usages for unfamiliar words. He noted that this is most useful for cooking shows. In fact, the panellists generally agreed that cooking shows were annoyingly complex, especially for those who don't regularly cook themselves. Tymon noted that she'd sometimes watch YouTube videos to learn how to describe these unfamiliar topics in English.     Miyasaka shows off his HugeDict   This prompted a brief conversation on the evolution of the Japanese language. They all noted that a lot of anime have gotten simpler, with the technobabble and complex sci-fi going out of fashion. Gurunathan also noted that a lot of memes and phrases have evolved over time, something he'd noted from watching VTubers. The panel discussed the evolution of the phrase “笑う” (to laugh), how it turned into “www”, the Japanese equivalent of “lol”, and how the appearance of those letters eventually became summarised as “草” (grass), which is now used as a shorthand for “lol”.    The panel closed out with Ingram asking what sort of media the translators would like to work on in the future. Gurunathan, as a fan of Japanese pro-wrestling, said that he'd like to work on subtitling wrestling streams. Tymon mentioned that she'd like to get involved with translating more voice actor events and concerts. She's already done a few of these in the past for Crunchyroll, including some for CRX itself. Lensenmayer noted that he's already done about 2,500 episodes of anime in his career, and would like to do more video game translation. In the past, he's translated Steins;Gate Zero, Chaos;Child, Punch Line and a couple of undisclosed major mobile game releases. Miyasaka also noted that he wanted to translate video games, but instead wanted to translate western games into Japanese, noting Firewatch as a hopeful example.    Unfortunately, the VOD for the panel was only available over the CRX weekend, but for those that managed to catch it in time, it was an enlightening and detailed look at translating anime. For those that aren't able to make it to San Jose, this was their first opportunity to watch the annual panel, so it would be good if more recordings were available in the future. Translators within anime/manga/games are frequently devalued not only by the fans but also by the large entertainment companies that seek to exploit them. Panels like these are valuable, not just because they make for an interesting watch, but also because they build more much-needed respect for these essential workers.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

I think the red knight didn't feel as dangerous as it was in the LN but that's a minor quibble. From the opening and the pacing, it looks like the anime will adapt until Volume 2. I'm really excited to see how the anime will depict spoiler[Akari's real personality].

Dead Detective did its best, but the production values and plotting crumpled; fingers crossed this one goes the distance.  Presumably Akari will be something other than Nice, Existent, and Increasingly Down Bad once she gets shipped off to church.     Menou and Momo are great, though.  Especially poor Momo, doomed to lose to BSS.

I interpreted the train-wreck scene at the end as the explanation for the time-stutter in the fight with the Red Knight (and the ""simultaneous"" scene between Momo and the Princess) --- that was the moment Akari reset the timeline to.     Quote:    And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.            Given that I think Menou's vision provides an explanation for the time-stutter earlier in the episode, I interpret it as a memory of the original timeline.

So looking at this one as a must see to the end.  I wonder if the anime adaptation will beat out the english light novels.   About Menou, while the anime shows her killing someone who probably deserves to die, we must remember spoiler[she and her group kill everyone who has that power/skill.  Guilt or innocence doesn't matter.  People who want to have normal lives within soceity and don't use their power/skill, are still hunted down and killed.  If you have been isekai'd, they will search for you, and they will kill you.  So even if you choose to be a good person and not use your power, you will still be killed.]  So Menou is a problematic character.  You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.

It seems that Beckett has a real disdain towards the target audience - or at least what that audience likes and why - and will not be objective.            And I propose that he should be allowed to review whatever he wants, which I imagine will continue to happen. I've been following ANN for a while, and considering he really liked JJK (way more than I did), did super in-depth adoring reviews on AoT (which personally just allowed me to see that the show was continuing not to be my thing at all but I admired his passion) and his criticisms of Demon Slayer were pretty mild, it's just that fanbase is ridiculous, I never got the impression he doesn't like shonen or doesn't fall into its audience at all. And he's suited just fine for this series, as the reason people are interested in THIS show is because it's offering a bit of a twist on the isekai premise, and that seems to be what he was hooked by as well. This review focused on whether the show itself held together beyond that initial hook, and offered a fair assessment.   And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

Funny how, from what I'm seeing, the critics are liking this more than the fans. Perhaps seeing their precious self-insert potato-kun get a murder done on him was triggering.

Quite aside from the obviously ominous name of ""Archbishop Orwell"" and the fact that any time a western church (i.e. Catholic/Anglican in its structure and iconography) is depicted in anime they're generally bad news. There's a whole pile of secrets awaiting us (and, by the looks of things, Menou) there. I think the fact that Menou will have her faith in the church challenged is fairly obvious. It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great. The bubbly crushing-on-Menou personality is plenty fun, but could outstay its welcome fairly easily.   Enjoying this so far, and there's plenty of promise.

I'm enjoying it so far, but not interested in seeing the usual tropes, so fingers crossed   Stopping the train that way was odd. The engine was going full tilt, but instead of shutting off the engine, they just slowed the train by using a magic net (which, at that speed, probably would have caused the middle and rear cars of the train to derail at best (unless all the cars were also slowed by the magic?)) and somehow that caused it to turn off?      zensunni wrote:      And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""            I'm guessing those two moments are for the same event and are proof that time was rewound from the wreck we see at the end of the episode back to that point.

So looking at this one as a must see to the end.  I wonder if the anime adaptation will beat out the english light novels.   About Menou, while the anime shows her killing someone who probably deserves to die, we must remember spoiler[she and her group kill everyone who has that power/skill.  Guilt or innocence doesn't matter.  People who want to have normal lives within soceity and don't use their power/skill, are still hunted down and killed.  If you have been isekai'd, they will search for you, and they will kill you.  So even if you choose to be a good person and not use your power, you will still be killed.]  So Menou is a problematic character.  You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.            I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

I think the red knight didn't feel as dangerous as it was in the LN but that's a minor quibble. From the opening and the pacing, it looks like the anime will adapt until Volume 2. I'm really excited to see how the anime will depict spoiler[Akari's real personality].

Dead Detective did its best, but the production values and plotting crumpled; fingers crossed this one goes the distance.  Presumably Akari will be something other than Nice, Existent, and Increasingly Down Bad once she gets shipped off to church.     Menou and Momo are great, though.  Especially poor Momo, doomed to lose to BSS.

If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.            Given that I think Menou's vision provides an explanation for the time-stutter earlier in the episode, I interpret it as a memory of the original timeline.

So looking at this one as a must see to the end.  I wonder if the anime adaptation will beat out the english light novels.   About Menou, while the anime shows her killing someone who probably deserves to die, we must remember spoiler[she and her group kill everyone who has that power/skill.  Guilt or innocence doesn't matter.  People who want to have normal lives within soceity and don't use their power/skill, are still hunted down and killed.  If you have been isekai'd, they will search for you, and they will kill you.  So even if you choose to be a good person and not use your power, you will still be killed.]  So Menou is a problematic character.  You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.

It seems that Beckett has a real disdain towards the target audience - or at least what that audience likes and why - and will not be objective.            And I propose that he should be allowed to review whatever he wants, which I imagine will continue to happen. I've been following ANN for a while, and considering he really liked JJK (way more than I did), did super in-depth adoring reviews on AoT (which personally just allowed me to see that the show was continuing not to be my thing at all but I admired his passion) and his criticisms of Demon Slayer were pretty mild, it's just that fanbase is ridiculous, I never got the impression he doesn't like shonen or doesn't fall into its audience at all. And he's suited just fine for this series, as the reason people are interested in THIS show is because it's offering a bit of a twist on the isekai premise, and that seems to be what he was hooked by as well. This review focused on whether the show itself held together beyond that initial hook, and offered a fair assessment.   And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

Funny how, from what I'm seeing, the critics are liking this more than the fans. Perhaps seeing their precious self-insert potato-kun get a murder done on him was triggering.

Quite aside from the obviously ominous name of ""Archbishop Orwell"" and the fact that any time a western church (i.e. Catholic/Anglican in its structure and iconography) is depicted in anime they're generally bad news. There's a whole pile of secrets awaiting us (and, by the looks of things, Menou) there. I think the fact that Menou will have her faith in the church challenged is fairly obvious. It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great. The bubbly crushing-on-Menou personality is plenty fun, but could outstay its welcome fairly easily.   Enjoying this so far, and there's plenty of promise.

I'm enjoying it so far, but not interested in seeing the usual tropes, so fingers crossed   Stopping the train that way was odd. The engine was going full tilt, but instead of shutting off the engine, they just slowed the train by using a magic net (which, at that speed, probably would have caused the middle and rear cars of the train to derail at best (unless all the cars were also slowed by the magic?)) and somehow that caused it to turn off?      zensunni wrote:      And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode.

I'm guessing those two moments are for the same event and are proof that time was rewound from the wreck we see at the end of the episode back to that point.

I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.

There's also an occasional tendancy towards excessive lore-dumping. The question is whether the adaptation can overcome those faults.    So far, it's looking good. The first three episodes definitely surpass the source in places.

It seems the show is set to really only cover them when it's necessary, which the LN tends to reveal more of its hand before it's actually necessary.  The way the LN introduces Akari you're actually in her headspace and get her thoughts on things before Menou appears.  spoiler[Which serves as a flag for the readers as her feelings and thoughts do not match up well with her behavior after meeting Menou], but it wasn't really necessary to have to go there.

I wonder if this entire story maybe isn't Akari's first trip through this tale.            Exactly! There was a huge hint there that Akari has either been through this all before OR her life in Japan featured abandonment and loneliness to spare. Perhaps this could have something to do with the dreams that Menou has about being in a classroom in Japan with her best friend who has Akari's outline waving at her? Is it possible that Menou is also not a native of this world, but also an otherworlder with a pure concept that is just as dangerous as Akari's?    And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode. There was a moment, shortly before Akari interupted Menou's fight with the Red Knight when she attacked and then was back in position to attack again and had a 'Whoa... that was weird' reaction, and then the same basic thing happened in the fight between Momo and the Princess, and one of them said something like ""That was disconcerting...""   And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.   There is one thing I wonder about with the crusade the Church has against Otherworlders with Pure Concepts. If ALL Pure Concepts eventually corrupt the person, how did their society get influenced so strongly by Japanese culture and language? It seems like, if the otherworlders were always so unstable, they wouldn't have had the type of impact on the world that they did to influence so much of their culture. This says to me that the church is actually reacting to the few extreme cases... the Great Human Errors... and eliminating ALL otherworlders in order to prevent any more catastrophes of that magnitude, when it is possible that some otherworlders might be able to remain stable with their Pure Concepts and not lose control.   I'm guessing that is the direction Menou's thoughts will be heading in the story at least... since Akari seems to be a girl that has already lived through some heavy stuff and maintained a positive outlook on life and might be the type that won't appear to be corrupted by repeated use of her powers, or suspected repeated use of her powers since Menou won't really know that they were used since it will be to save her life every time.

I think the red knight didn't feel as dangerous as it was in the LN but that's a minor quibble. From the opening and the pacing, it looks like the anime will adapt until Volume 2. I'm really excited to see how the anime will depict spoiler[Akari's real personality].

Dead Detective did its best, but the production values and plotting crumpled; fingers crossed this one goes the distance.  Presumably Akari will be something other than Nice, Existent, and Increasingly Down Bad once she gets shipped off to church.     Menou and Momo are great, though.  Especially poor Momo, doomed to lose to BSS.

I interpreted the train-wreck scene at the end as the explanation for the time-stutter in the fight with the Red Knight (and the ""simultaneous"" scene between Momo and the Princess) --- that was the moment Akari reset the timeline to.     Quote:    And, technically, the train wreck scene was  Menou's imagination of what might have happened... at least that's my take on it. If we see the scene from Akari's point of view at some point we'll know for sure I guess.            Given that I think Menou's vision provides an explanation for the time-stutter earlier in the episode, I interpret it as a memory of the original timeline.

So looking at this one as a must see to the end.  I wonder if the anime adaptation will beat out the english light novels.   About Menou, while the anime shows her killing someone who probably deserves to die, we must remember spoiler[she and her group kill everyone who has that power/skill.  Guilt or innocence doesn't matter.  People who want to have normal lives within soceity and don't use their power/skill, are still hunted down and killed.  If you have been isekai'd, they will search for you, and they will kill you.  So even if you choose to be a good person and not use your power, you will still be killed.]  So Menou is a problematic character.  You can sympathize with her for her upbringing (brainwashing?) and despise her for her actions.   I like Momo too and can understand why she is the way she is.  Like Menou too.  Much discussion could be had on who is ultimately responsible and if really any justice can be had.  Probably not.

It seems that Beckett has a real disdain towards the target audience - or at least what that audience likes and why - and will not be objective.            And I propose that he should be allowed to review whatever he wants, which I imagine will continue to happen. I've been following ANN for a while, and considering he really liked JJK (way more than I did), did super in-depth adoring reviews on AoT (which personally just allowed me to see that the show was continuing not to be my thing at all but I admired his passion) and his criticisms of Demon Slayer were pretty mild, it's just that fanbase is ridiculous, I never got the impression he doesn't like shonen or doesn't fall into its audience at all. And he's suited just fine for this series, as the reason people are interested in THIS show is because it's offering a bit of a twist on the isekai premise, and that seems to be what he was hooked by as well. This review focused on whether the show itself held together beyond that initial hook, and offered a fair assessment.   And honestly, considering you criticized the main character of this show and its fandom despite admitting not even watching the first episode in the Premiere thread, I don't think you personally have much room to talk about how it's bad to approach something with preconceived notions or disdain for the target audience.   For me, I think what will make or break this show is how Akari holds up as a character, and if her deal and her relationship with Menou deepens wants she finds out about Menou's hidden agenda. If she's what she appears on the surface, or they're just leaning on tropes with her, the central relationship won't be dynamic enough to carry the show, so I'm also hoping that hint about not wanting to be left behind means we'll get some good character writing and reason to root for this dynamic. There were quite a few moments in the eps that made me roll my eyes, but enough mystery and intrigue and potential in the plot I'm willing to keep going. Plus, I'm trash for girls being cool action heroes and gay with each other, I won't lie.

Funny how, from what I'm seeing, the critics are liking this more than the fans. Perhaps seeing their precious self-insert potato-kun get a murder done on him was triggering.

Quite aside from the obviously ominous name of ""Archbishop Orwell"" and the fact that any time a western church (i.e. Catholic/Anglican in its structure and iconography) is depicted in anime they're generally bad news. There's a whole pile of secrets awaiting us (and, by the looks of things, Menou) there. I think the fact that Menou will have her faith in the church challenged is fairly obvious. It'd be more of a twist if she didn't and it was just a straight up choice of betraying them for Akari.   Akari seems to have her share of secrets too, which is great. The bubbly crushing-on-Menou personality is plenty fun, but could outstay its welcome fairly easily.   Enjoying this so far, and there's plenty of promise.

I'm enjoying it so far, but not interested in seeing the usual tropes, so fingers crossed   Stopping the train that way was odd. The engine was going full tilt, but instead of shutting off the engine, they just slowed the train by using a magic net (which, at that speed, probably would have caused the middle and rear cars of the train to derail at best (unless all the cars were also slowed by the magic?)) and somehow that caused it to turn off?      zensunni wrote:      And the train wreck scene at the end was NOT the first indication that Akari's pure concept had come into play during the episode.

I'm guessing those two moments are for the same event and are proof that time was rewound from the wreck we see at the end of the episode back to that point.

I've definitely already seen some people making that same mistake, if you want to call it a mistake, of not recognizing that Menou is at a minimum far more complicated than ""hero stopping monsters"" many want to paint her as out the gate. I haven't read the novels, but it's really obvious there are only a few directions things could be heading, an only a couple of them let her stay in the realm of any sort of heroic character - flawed or otherwise.    My sense of the ""justice"" issue is that, as it often turns out, it is a matter of stop diffing a deeper pit once you realize what's going on. My guess is that one or the other or both by the end will recognize that philosophy too late, or have given up on it despite realizing it.
