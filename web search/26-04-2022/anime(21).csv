DC and now Star Wars go for older teens and 20-somethings. Are adult children more lucrative right now? Star Wars is currently all in on D+ and DC is equally pushing their streaming lineup hard. That might be the reason to go Seinen as Jump readers don´t have a streaming service of their own.

DC and now Star Wars go for older teens and 20-somethings. Are adult children more lucrative right now? Star Wars is currently all in on D+ and DC is equally pushing their streaming lineup hard. That might be the reason to go Seinen as Jump readers don´t have a streaming service of their own.

Obviously this not just exclusive to the video games industry but all around the tech industry and far beyond that, but this is why video game industry needs to unionize so this type of stuff can’t happen anymore. Like jeez is it really hard to pay your employees full time or contract a good healthy wage that reflects how much hard work they’re putting into your company and not to be treated like garbage.

I can't wait for Nintendo to blacklist this guy from the industry.           It's kind of open secret that Nintendo has had toxic labor practices for a long time, like hiring contractors from outside for 11 months, force them go on a 'two-month break', then let them shift in again from outside agencies for another 11 months, just to keep the contractor status so not to need offer full time and the benefits that come with it. Especially blatant when the majority of the workforce seem to be these 'contractors'.   Before passing judgment, wait for the NLRB response, that will be interesting.

You guys do know that companies both large and small have a bad habit of engaging it shitty practices that can make not only the lives of their employees unnecessarily difficult but even consumers right?   Yes a small fraction of these claims and allegations can be bullshit but by and large their are legit issues. Also LOL at “fudging Nintendo over” same Nintendo that causes YouTube  channels featuring music from their games (some of which they never officially release) to shut down for copyright infringement.

Obviously this not just exclusive to the video games industry but all around the tech industry and far beyond that, but this is why video game industry needs to unionize so this type of stuff can’t happen anymore. Like jeez is it really hard to pay your employees full time or contract a good healthy wage that reflects how much hard work they’re putting into your company and not to be treated like garbage.

It's kind of open secret that Nintendo has had toxic labor practices for a long time, like hiring contractors from outside for 11 months, force them go on a 'two-month break', then let them shift in again from outside agencies for another 11 months, just to keep the contractor status so not to need offer full time and the benefits that come with it. Especially blatant when the majority of the workforce seem to be these 'contractors'.   Before passing judgment, wait for the NLRB response, that will be interesting.

Obviously this not just exclusive to the video games industry but all around the tech industry and far beyond that, but this is why video game industry needs to unionize so this type of stuff can’t happen anymore. Like jeez is it really hard to pay your employees full time or contract a good healthy wage that reflects how much hard work they’re putting into your company and not to be treated like garbage.

I can't wait for Nintendo to blacklist this guy from the industry.           It's kind of open secret that Nintendo has had toxic labor practices for a long time, like hiring contractors from outside for 11 months, force them go on a 'two-month break', then let them shift in again from outside agencies for another 11 months, just to keep the contractor status so not to need offer full time and the benefits that come with it. Especially blatant when the majority of the workforce seem to be these 'contractors'.   Before passing judgment, wait for the NLRB response, that will be interesting.

Obviously this not just exclusive to the video games industry but all around the tech industry and far beyond that, but this is why video game industry needs to unionize so this type of stuff can’t happen anymore. Like jeez is it really hard to pay your employees full time or contract a good healthy wage that reflects how much hard work they’re putting into your company and not to be treated like garbage.

I can't wait for Nintendo to blacklist this guy from the industry.           It's kind of open secret that Nintendo has had toxic labor practices for a long time, like hiring contractors from outside for 11 months, force them go on a 'two-month break', then let them shift in again from outside agencies for another 11 months, just to keep the contractor status so not to need offer full time and the benefits that come with it. Especially blatant when the majority of the workforce seem to be these 'contractors'.   Before passing judgment, wait for the NLRB response, that will be interesting.

You guys do know that companies both large and small have a bad habit of engaging it shitty practices that can make not only the lives of their employees unnecessarily difficult but even consumers right?   Yes a small fraction of these claims and allegations can be bullshit but by and large their are legit issues. Also LOL at “fudging Nintendo over” same Nintendo that causes YouTube  channels featuring music from their games (some of which they never officially release) to shut down for copyright infringement.

Justin breaks down the grueling work of an anime producer. ―  Mikosh asked: I noticed that anime have different kinds of producers listed in their credits, like executive producers, producers, animation producers, etc. So what is the job of each one of them and in what way each producer impacts the pro...                           column          35 comments       Answerman - How Much Of The Doujinshi Scene Is Porn?   2019 Aug 15, 02:00 35 comments                 manga    Over 700,000 attendees visited Comiket this year, the mecca of self-published comics.

For starters, “lolicon” or “roricon” is short for “Lolita Complex.” “Lolita” as a term for an under-age girl comes from the book of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov. It's about a man wh...                    column          52 comments       Answerman - Will The Macross Franchise Ever Be Made Available In The West?   2019 Aug  8, 02:00 52 comments                 anime                industry    Harmony Gold announced at AX that its license has extended into the future to the dismay of some fans. What would it take to get uncut Macross in the West? Well...it's complicated. ―  Jake asked: During this year's AX, Harmony Gold held a panel stating that they have extended the right of the original 1980's Robotech/Macross franchise. This shocked many fans, who hoped Harmony Gold would lose the lic...                    column          6 comments       Answerman - How Do Japanese Guests Get Invited To Conventions?   2019 Aug  1, 02:00 6 comments                 events                industry    Justin breaks down the many hoops event staff have to jump through to get your favorite artist stateside. ―  Joey asked: Anime fans in America tend to complain that there are not enough Japanese guests being invited to conventions. I understand that it is very costly to bring Japanese guests to American conventions, so I was wondering what other barriers are considered before a convention can decide ...                    column          8 comments       Answerman - Does Being Nominated or Winning an Eisner Award Impact Manga Sales?   2019 Jul 27, 02:00 8 comments                 manga    Can a prestigious award drive up sales or do manga readers even care?

Justin looks back on old video rooms and industry panels to find out. ―  Fred asked: I've only been going to conventions for the past year or so, and I'm curious how they've evolved over time. You'd actually be surprised by how little has changed for anime conventions over the years.

Watanabe happened upon an article from The Guardian, describing how a contest...                    column          10 comments       Answerman - What Is That Little Round Outdoor Grill In Anime?   2019 Jul 11, 02:00 10 comments                 just for fun    These portable stoves haven't changed since the Edo period!

I didn't get to hear radio much but in the few times I did most of the time they were playing non-anison J-Pop or even Western music.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.2            After two episodes that mostly amounted to exposition about a new random threat that we barely got the chance to see or understand, this week's episode should have been rewarding; all the setup is out of the way, and now it's time to tackle the threat of this giant turtle head-on. But I gotta be honest: I feel very disconnected from a lot of the turmoil that was going on in this episode. It's an inevitable consequence of being told constantly about how destructive the turtle is but never getting to actually see any of that destruction happen or get a better visual sense of how prominent the threat was. It seems like the showrunners have been saving all that carnage for the battle in this episode, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode only makes a lot of the devastation come across as very passive, and as a result, none of the deaths on screen feel like they carry any significant weight. When one of the prominent political figures goes out in a blaze of glory or when hundreds of soldiers die on the battlefield, it just makes them feel like fodder, even if that was never the intention.    That said, this episode does have its moments, accompanied by some nice animation cuts here and there. The way the turtle's head is cut off is appreciably creative. I also liked the beginning of this episode where Naofumi was actually seen as someone to be revered with a lot of respect and authority. Again, it's nice seeing the difference between how he is treated now versus how he was treated before. It even got to the point where his very presence seemed to boost morale amongst soldiers and despite the casualties, his plans did seem to work. Obviously things aren't that simple and I immediately called that there was a catch when the turtle was “killed”. We still don't know who's been controlling this turtle behind the scenes, and the turtle's presence still feels foreboding even without its head. Let's hope the conflict gets more engaging and streamlined next week.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.2            After two episodes that mostly amounted to exposition about a new random threat that we barely got the chance to see or understand, this week's episode should have been rewarding; all the setup is out of the way, and now it's time to tackle the threat of this giant turtle head-on. But I gotta be honest: I feel very disconnected from a lot of the turmoil that was going on in this episode. It's an inevitable consequence of being told constantly about how destructive the turtle is but never getting to actually see any of that destruction happen or get a better visual sense of how prominent the threat was. It seems like the showrunners have been saving all that carnage for the battle in this episode, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode only makes a lot of the devastation come across as very passive, and as a result, none of the deaths on screen feel like they carry any significant weight. When one of the prominent political figures goes out in a blaze of glory or when hundreds of soldiers die on the battlefield, it just makes them feel like fodder, even if that was never the intention.    That said, this episode does have its moments, accompanied by some nice animation cuts here and there. The way the turtle's head is cut off is appreciably creative. I also liked the beginning of this episode where Naofumi was actually seen as someone to be revered with a lot of respect and authority.

The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 Episode 3  by MrAJCosplay, Apr 24th 2022                   How would you rate episode 3 of The Rising of The Shield Hero Season 2 ?                     Community score: 3.2            After two episodes that mostly amounted to exposition about a new random threat that we barely got the chance to see or understand, this week's episode should have been rewarding; all the setup is out of the way, and now it's time to tackle the threat of this giant turtle head-on. But I gotta be honest: I feel very disconnected from a lot of the turmoil that was going on in this episode. It's an inevitable consequence of being told constantly about how destructive the turtle is but never getting to actually see any of that destruction happen or get a better visual sense of how prominent the threat was. It seems like the showrunners have been saving all that carnage for the battle in this episode, but establishing a threat AND taking that threat out in the same episode only makes a lot of the devastation come across as very passive, and as a result, none of the deaths on screen feel like they carry any significant weight. When one of the prominent political figures goes out in a blaze of glory or when hundreds of soldiers die on the battlefield, it just makes them feel like fodder, even if that was never the intention.    That said, this episode does have its moments, accompanied by some nice animation cuts here and there. The way the turtle's head is cut off is appreciably creative. I also liked the beginning of this episode where Naofumi was actually seen as someone to be revered with a lot of respect and authority. Again, it's nice seeing the difference between how he is treated now versus how he was treated before. It even got to the point where his very presence seemed to boost morale amongst soldiers and despite the casualties, his plans did seem to work. Obviously things aren't that simple and I immediately called that there was a catch when the turtle was “killed”. We still don't know who's been controlling this turtle behind the scenes, and the turtle's presence still feels foreboding even without its head. Let's hope the conflict gets more engaging and streamlined next week.

Junji Ōno's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan no Shima (Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan's Island) manga (pictured at left) launched in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in May 2016, and ended in May 2019. The manga has a total of five volumes.    The manga is a spinoff of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga. The manga tells the story of Cucuruz Doan, a character who appeared in the similarly-titled 15th episode of Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. In the episode, the titular character is a Zeon pilot who abandoned his post after refusing an order.    Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga is also inspired by and re-imagines the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Viz Media published part of the manga in North America from 2002 to 2004, before it halted publication of the series. Vertical licensed the series in 2013, and released all 12 volumes.    The manga inspired a six-episode anime project in Japanese theaters from 2015 to 2018. Yasuhiko worked as chief director, character designer, and storyboarder for the anime. A 13-episode television series recompilation of the anime premiered in April 2019.

Amuro set out on the island in search of Zeon spies, but find  a group of children and a Zaku mobile suit on the supposedly uninhabited island. With the Gundam left behind, Amuro encounters a man who calls himself Cucuruz Doan. After uncovering the secret of the island, Amuro attempts to make his way back to the Gundam to escape.

The team members all fields MS-06GD Zaku mobile suits with increased leg thrusters for enhanced maneuverability and custom loadouts.     The cast members for other Federation and Zeon military personnel include (from left to right in the image above):    Katsuyuki Konishi as a staff officer involved in the Odessa offensive who puts a lot of command pressure on Bright Noa   Hiroshi Shirokuma as Elran, a lieutenant general in the Earth Federation Forces   Hiroshi Naka as Johann Ibrahim Revil (returning from Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin), the supreme commander of the Earth Federation Space Force that sends White Base to Belfast under the command of General Gopp   Naomi Kusumi as Gopp, a general who commands the Le Grand Pas fleet, and is negotiation with M'Quve for the capture of Gibraltar.

Junji Ōno's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan no Shima (Mobile Suit Gundam The Origin MSD: Cucuruz Doan's Island) manga (pictured at left) launched in Kadokawa's Gundam Ace magazine in May 2016, and ended in May 2019. The manga has a total of five volumes.    The manga is a spinoff of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga. The manga tells the story of Cucuruz Doan, a character who appeared in the similarly-titled 15th episode of Yoshiyuki Tomino's original Mobile Suit Gundam anime series. In the episode, the titular character is a Zeon pilot who abandoned his post after refusing an order.    Yasuhiko's Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin manga is also inspired by and re-imagines the original Mobile Suit Gundam series. Viz Media published part of the manga in North America from 2002 to 2004, before it halted publication of the series. Vertical licensed the series in 2013, and released all 12 volumes.    The manga inspired a six-episode anime project in Japanese theaters from 2015 to 2018. Yasuhiko worked as chief director, character designer, and storyboarder for the anime. A 13-episode television series recompilation of the anime premiered in April 2019.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

But, the arc was pretty bad with false finishes and pacing. I feel he could cut some of the stuff, to make it flow better. I think he does have the balls for it, however, I think it would be bad if he make his arc longer. (the same thing happen to Horikoshi with MHA)    Good on the editorial department, Tabata ruins the pace by having the final fight of the arc be 14 chapters, all the other fights (before Asta's show up) were greatly pace. The best part about Black Clover was its lightning-fast pacing, when it stops going fast a lot of the flaws begin to show      Back to top                  Connor Dino    Joined: 20 Dec 2010 		    Posts: 174       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 6:46 pm              #rajsaha wrote:       Яeverse wrote:    Hope the final arc is the entire length of the manga           Tabata don't have balls to create a long ass arc and not to make it boring            I am so confused and intrigued by this comment.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Crunchyroll Expo 2020: The Rising of the Shield Hero Panel   by Kalai Chik, Sep 11th 2020          The anime adaptation of Aneko Yusagi's The Rising of the Shield Hero turned heads with its 25-episode debut season. Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to. Before closing off the panel entirely, surprise guests Kaito Ishikawa (Naofumi), Asami Seto (Raphtalia), and Rina Hidaka (Firo) all separately shared their reflection of season one and their characters through audio. Even though there was no video recording accompanying their audio, all three actors couldn't hold back their tension and excitement to reprise their roles. For those who can't wait for next year, Rina Hidaka puts it best: “Season two will be here soon!”     discuss this in the forum (2 posts) |        bookmark/share with:               Convention homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Last year's Crunchyroll Expo revealed the series was green-lit for second and third season, and after today the wait is over. Season two will premiere sometime in 2021, and the third season won't be as long of a wait.    This year's panel for Shield Hero features Keigo Koyanagi (series composition), Masahiro Suwa (character design and chief animation director), Junichiro Tamura (producer from Kadokawa), and MC'd by voice actress Sarah Emi Bridcutt.    Following up on the excitement of last year, the panel began with a Q&A focused on reflection and production. Tamura shared he was surprised to see a variety of languages and support from fans around the world commenting on the Shield Hero videos. Regarding what episode drove the most excitement, Koyanagi confidently claimed episode 21, aka Myne's “execution.” As reference, Crunchyroll's post of that scene has 2.8M views on YouTube, making it the most popular clip from the series.    On a more relaxed note, character designer Suwa voiced his surprise at how popular Raphtalia was, but he thought she and Naofumi make a “great combo.” Conversely, his favorite character to design was The Pope because of how hard it was to pin down. Otherwise, Suwa tried to keep the designs relatively simple to make it easier for others to draw.    The next set of questions focused on the care and level of detail taken in terms of the script and the character designs. Although Koyanagi said it was difficult to convince the audience to keep watching and build excitement for the following episodes, Bridcutt assured that he did a great job based on the sheer volume of reactions from Twitter and streams of the show.    When asked if there was anything memorable from the voice recording sessions, Tamura said his impressions of the characters had changed once he heard the voice auditions. In addition to the main cast, he had help picked the candidates that fit characters that show up later in the series. Looking back at last year, the panelists voiced how encouraged and motivated they were after interacting with fans overseas. Although the autograph sessions were more than what they expected, they all thoroughly enjoyed their time seeing fans face to face and receiving words of appreciation and fanart. They wish they had more to show last year, but luckily they have more to reveal.    Unfortunately, they couldn't reveal all their secrets for what's to come, but what they could talk about was how production for season two is rolling along. Producer Tamura divulged how the script and other parts of anime production were proceeding, but there was no information on how much of the story the next season would cover. Of course, the question that many fans—and Sarah Emi Bridcutt herself—had on their mind was, “Will Myne be back?” No clear answer was given, but Tamura encouraged people to stay tuned for characters who might return.  Auditions for the upcoming season are underway.    In the meantime, because Masato Jinbo had replaced Takao Abo as director for season two, Tamura reiterated that there are many surprises to look forward to.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.     discuss this in the forum (1 post) |        bookmark/share with:               Interview homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.

How Composer MAYUKO Created Ranking of Kings' Fantasy-Infused Score   by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 11th 2022          Writer, composer, arranger and singer, MAYUKO has been performing as a singer-songwriter since she was a student. As a composer, she created music for the drama The Full-Time Wife Escapist, the anime Cells at Work! and her latest soundtrack, available now from Milan Records, is all about capturing the magic of a fantasy world. We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life.

We sat down with MAYUKO to discuss how she translated the characters and environment of Wit Studio's Ranking of Kings anime series to music.    What sorts of preparation did you do to get a sense of the 'sound' of Ranking of Kings?   I was playing Beethoven, Chopin, Mendelssohn, etc. to bring classical music into my life. It reminded me of my days as a music student.    Are there any key instruments you utilized for consistency throughout the series' score, or is it eclectic?   Since my goal was to build out a full orchestra rather than a specific instrument, I always kept an instrumental instruction book close by and would think about the best instrument that could produce the most appropriate sound in each arrangement. For example, I could really feel the potential of the horn in battle pieces – strong, fat and explosive sound, like in the song “Senritsu.”     What emotions were you hoping to inspire in the series' main theme?   I was told the main theme would be used mostly in teasers and trailers rather than the show itself, so I created it with a more comprehensive, birds-eye vision. The story is about to begin! The chorus of the song expresses the grandeur of the kingdom and the sopranino recorder expresses the Bojji's adventure.     Were there any specifications asked by the series' director or sound director or were you given free rein to experiment?   At my first meeting, I had a spreadsheet of music with over 70 songs and each song was explained in details. Some instruments were specified, but many were left to me. For instance, I decided to use the trombone for “Theme of Kage.”    What was the thought behind the use of a sopranino recorder for Bojji's theme?   I was asked to use a specific instrument for Bojji's theme, and there was a memo asking if that instrument should be a flute. I tried various things, but ultimately decided on a sopranino recorder, which can be both relaxing and cute as well as moderately powerful and strong. It's a great instrument with a wide range of tones.    Are there pieces of music that you feel closely embody specific characters? For example, Bosse, Despa, or Kage?   Bosse is a giant, so boom! I was conscious of using heavy percussion and a low pitch. It was actually easy to create because I only had to keep that in mind. From the beginning, I was given the instruction that Despa's sound should be “cheerful jazz,” and I was very excited to create it. I think it is one of the most unique songs on the soundtrack. Kage, meanwhile, is a survivor of an attack by a group of assassins, but he's not a bad guy, so the instrumentation had to express that middle ground. I thought, “well, maybe the trombone?” Ouken is clad in armor, so I thought the sound of metal = cathedral bells. And then Miranjo expresses some weirdness with the female chorus, triple-time and shimmering bells. Each character was expressed using various rules.     What's your process when you get 'stuck'?   Once you leave the work, you leave the work. When I take a short break and return a few hours later, I start again, and my calm self comes back to me, saying, “What was I so worried about?” When that calm self does not come back… I cry.    Is there a character you came to fond of by the show's end?   Hiling. I don't have such a cute tsundere mother. She can also use her healing ability and I think she is the strongest. I want her to be happy. I want her to listen to my problems when I'm in trouble. I also want to be friends with Despa.    Is there a particular memory of working on the series that will stick with you?   When I wrote the song, “Bojji to Kage no Yujyo,” I was very fond of it and actually wrote and sang lyrics to add to it. It's a song that says, “I will always be by your side.” The reason it was used in the final episode was because of my passion for the song. I couldn't be happier and am so glad I am singer-songwriter.    The full soundtrack for Ranking of Kings is available from Milan Records on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and more.

I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Like I get they seem to be going through stuff and she's honestly just there to baby sit them and be their go-pher. But they are almost always actively terrible people not only to her but everyone else   I mean you can have bad boy or troubled leads totally, but they do like nothing to make these two just hateful and annoyed.

If Hiyori is ""Cinderella"" they're basically meant to be her wicked steps sister's, you not finding them appealing is pretty much on purpose.

I love the source material, I'm loving seeing where the anime is taking the plot, and I can't wait to see what comes next! We all should love the precious potato eyebrow girl.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.     I don't want to say that you're supposed to hate them, though only because they have their own storylines separate from Hiyori and they're definitely not solely supposed to be disliked.

I have greatly appreciated your writeups thus far, because there's a lot of context to cram.

I fully confess that I have problematic taste, because I love them at their absolute worst. Watching them drop the act and verbally destroy Yumeru was the perfect capstone on the three-episode test. These boys are perfect in every way. (Though I think Yujiro earned extra points with, ""If she tries anything, I'll destroy her career.""  )      Back to top                  Saeryen    Joined: 26 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 443       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 9:41 am            Episode 3 was excellent! And I definitely saw some fairy tale parallels there. spoiler[The musical actress was very much a wicked stepsister figure to Hiyori's princess protagonist, and the idols were awesome as Prince Charming]. I hope they explore these parallels some more, I love fairy tales.

I'm sure when she wears her first cute outfit and her hair/makeup or whatever is done she'll transform. Then watch out idol boys! Will they fight over her? That's what I'm guessing...

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

Like I get they seem to be going through stuff and she's honestly just there to baby sit them and be their go-pher. But they are almost always actively terrible people not only to her but everyone else   I mean you can have bad boy or troubled leads totally, but they do like nothing to make these two just hateful and annoyed.

If Hiyori is ""Cinderella"" they're basically meant to be her wicked steps sister's, you not finding them appealing is pretty much on purpose.

I love the source material, I'm loving seeing where the anime is taking the plot, and I can't wait to see what comes next! We all should love the precious potato eyebrow girl.

Yep, the Heroine Tarumono music video even depicts them as the wicked stepsisters.     I don't want to say that you're supposed to hate them, though only because they have their own storylines separate from Hiyori and they're definitely not solely supposed to be disliked.

I have greatly appreciated your writeups thus far, because there's a lot of context to cram.

I fully confess that I have problematic taste, because I love them at their absolute worst. Watching them drop the act and verbally destroy Yumeru was the perfect capstone on the three-episode test. These boys are perfect in every way. (Though I think Yujiro earned extra points with, ""If she tries anything, I'll destroy her career.""  )      Back to top                  Saeryen    Joined: 26 Aug 2020 		    Posts: 443       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 9:41 am            Episode 3 was excellent! And I definitely saw some fairy tale parallels there. spoiler[The musical actress was very much a wicked stepsister figure to Hiyori's princess protagonist, and the idols were awesome as Prince Charming]. I hope they explore these parallels some more, I love fairy tales.

As a whole there isn't that much focus on romance there, I actually don't think any of the idols are in relationships last I checked.   That said, I'm actually rather fond of Hiyori. Both her and Mona (previews indicate you'll meet her eventually) are my favourite of the Honeyworks characters and Hiyori especially is so earnest I really enjoy seeing her win. Consequently, my love of these two girls have led me to hating LipxLip a fair bit! As episode 3 shows they do mellow out into being bearable but I still want to throttle them with Aizo's hideous half denim half flannel shirt. Their music is good though, much to my confliction lol.

News Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- Manga, Natsuko Taniguchi Win Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes   posted on 2022-04-25 10:45 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Izumi Okaya also wins short work prize for 2 manga    The Asahi Shimbun paper announced the winners for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize awards on Monday. The awards commemorate the contributions of the manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy/Mighty Atom, Kimba the White Lion/Jungle Emperor, Phoenix, Black Jack) by recognizing the manga that best follow his tradition.   Grand Prize  Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- (Chi - On the Movements of the Earth) Uoto Shogakukan (Big Comic Spirits, 2020-April 25, 2022) Sparks of the discoveries of the Renaissance are only beginning to burn in 15th century Europe, even as those who make discoveries are burned for their heresy. In Poland, a child prodigy named Rafal is expected to be another great mind in theology, but an encounter with a certain man leads him down the path to a heretical truth.   New Creator Prize  Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru (Youth Begins in a Corner of the Classroom) and Konya Sukiyaki da yo (It's Sukiyaki for Tonight) Natsuko Taniguchi Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru: Kadokawa (Monthly Comic Beam, 2020-2021) Konya Sukiyaki da yo: Shinchosha (Kurage Bunch, April-July 2021) Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru is an omnibus collection centering on youth stories. One  of the stories involves Mari Yoshida, a girl that only becomes the main character for a brief moment, before situations go sideways and she becomes cringe. Meanwhile, the alien Nell has held a dream of wanting to do something on Earth. Also in the classroom are people wanting to hide their otakudom, people who act out their ideal life on social media, and people who have confidence in their special destiny. Every kid in the classroom has their own secret, and you can't even claim to understand the kid right next to you.    Konya Sukiyaki da yo centers on two women in their 30s. Aiko is a freelance interior designer who wants to marry her current boyfriend, but envisions herself as far from the ideal wife, due to her being bad at household chores. Meanwhile, Tomoko is a picture book illustrator that is good at housework, but societal notions of marriage and romance don't hit home for her. They mutually decide that, until they find their perfect marriage partner, that they should get married with each other.  Short Work Prize  Ii Toshi o (Have a Good Year) and Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai (White Magnolias Do Not Fall Beautifully) Izumi Okaya Ii Toshi o: Kadokawa Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai: Shogakukan Ii Toshi o is set during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and centers on 42-year-old Toshio Haida, a person who lives alone and was formerly married. He uses the occasion of his mother's passing to move back in with his 72-year-old father in Tokyo. When he finds the 5 million yen that his mother left him, he wonders what to do with it.    Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai centers on three friends since high school, all born in 1963: Housewife Mari, who actually secretly hates cooking and cleaning and doing the laundry; Sayo, a woman in the middle of a divorce, and who has not seen the need to take care of herself even now; and Satoe, a career-minded woman who questions the pressure to have children after marriage. The three meet each other again when their former high school classmate Hiromi dies alone in the apartment she owned, the Hakurensō. For some reason, Hiromi named all three of them in her will, even though they were never close to her.    Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- creator Uoto is the youngest ever to win the Grand Prize at 24 years old. The manga also ended on Monday, with the manga's eighth and final compiled book volume shipping on June 30.    Asahi Shimbun had scheduled an awards ceremony in Tokyo on June 2,. The Grand Prize winner will receive a bronze statue and 2 million yen (about US$19,000), while the other winners will each receive a bronze statue and 1 million yen (about US$9,000).    This year's judging committee – manga creator Osamu Akimoto, manga creator Machiko Satonaka, entertainer Minami Takahashi, writer and Tohoku University of Art and Design instructor Yukiko Tomiyama, professor and scholar Shōhei Chūjō, manga critic Nobunaga Minami, and comedian and manga creator Taro Yabe  – selected the nominees from titles recommended by specialists and bookstore employees. To be eligible, the manga had to have had a compiled volume published in 2021.    Last year, nine titles were nominated (including Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise), and Kazumi Yamashita's Land won the Grand Prize. Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe's Frieren: Beyond Journey's End  won the New Creator prize, and Hiroko Nobara's Kieta Mama Tomo and Tsuma wa Kuchi o Kiite Kuremasen won the Short Work Prize. The committee also awarded the Special Prize to Koyoharu Gotouge's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga.

News Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- Manga, Natsuko Taniguchi Win Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes   posted on 2022-04-25 10:45 UTC-8 by Rafael Antonio Pineda         Izumi Okaya also wins short work prize for 2 manga    The Asahi Shimbun paper announced the winners for the 26th Annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize awards on Monday. The awards commemorate the contributions of the manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy/Mighty Atom, Kimba the White Lion/Jungle Emperor, Phoenix, Black Jack) by recognizing the manga that best follow his tradition.   Grand Prize  Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- (Chi - On the Movements of the Earth) Uoto Shogakukan (Big Comic Spirits, 2020-April 25, 2022) Sparks of the discoveries of the Renaissance are only beginning to burn in 15th century Europe, even as those who make discoveries are burned for their heresy. In Poland, a child prodigy named Rafal is expected to be another great mind in theology, but an encounter with a certain man leads him down the path to a heretical truth.   New Creator Prize  Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru (Youth Begins in a Corner of the Classroom) and Konya Sukiyaki da yo (It's Sukiyaki for Tonight) Natsuko Taniguchi Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru: Kadokawa (Monthly Comic Beam, 2020-2021) Konya Sukiyaki da yo: Shinchosha (Kurage Bunch, April-July 2021) Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru is an omnibus collection centering on youth stories. One  of the stories involves Mari Yoshida, a girl that only becomes the main character for a brief moment, before situations go sideways and she becomes cringe. Meanwhile, the alien Nell has held a dream of wanting to do something on Earth. Also in the classroom are people wanting to hide their otakudom, people who act out their ideal life on social media, and people who have confidence in their special destiny. Every kid in the classroom has their own secret, and you can't even claim to understand the kid right next to you.    Konya Sukiyaki da yo centers on two women in their 30s. Aiko is a freelance interior designer who wants to marry her current boyfriend, but envisions herself as far from the ideal wife, due to her being bad at household chores. Meanwhile, Tomoko is a picture book illustrator that is good at housework, but societal notions of marriage and romance don't hit home for her. They mutually decide that, until they find their perfect marriage partner, that they should get married with each other.  Short Work Prize  Ii Toshi o (Have a Good Year) and Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai (White Magnolias Do Not Fall Beautifully) Izumi Okaya Ii Toshi o: Kadokawa Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai: Shogakukan Ii Toshi o is set during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and centers on 42-year-old Toshio Haida, a person who lives alone and was formerly married. He uses the occasion of his mother's passing to move back in with his 72-year-old father in Tokyo. When he finds the 5 million yen that his mother left him, he wonders what to do with it.    Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai centers on three friends since high school, all born in 1963: Housewife Mari, who actually secretly hates cooking and cleaning and doing the laundry; Sayo, a woman in the middle of a divorce, and who has not seen the need to take care of herself even now; and Satoe, a career-minded woman who questions the pressure to have children after marriage. The three meet each other again when their former high school classmate Hiromi dies alone in the apartment she owned, the Hakurensō. For some reason, Hiromi named all three of them in her will, even though they were never close to her.    Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- creator Uoto is the youngest ever to win the Grand Prize at 24 years old. The manga also ended on Monday, with the manga's eighth and final compiled book volume shipping on June 30.    Asahi Shimbun had scheduled an awards ceremony in Tokyo on June 2,. The Grand Prize winner will receive a bronze statue and 2 million yen (about US$19,000), while the other winners will each receive a bronze statue and 1 million yen (about US$9,000).    This year's judging committee – manga creator Osamu Akimoto, manga creator Machiko Satonaka, entertainer Minami Takahashi, writer and Tohoku University of Art and Design instructor Yukiko Tomiyama, professor and scholar Shōhei Chūjō, manga critic Nobunaga Minami, and comedian and manga creator Taro Yabe  – selected the nominees from titles recommended by specialists and bookstore employees. To be eligible, the manga had to have had a compiled volume published in 2021.    Last year, nine titles were nominated (including Peleliu: Guernica of Paradise), and Kazumi Yamashita's Land won the Grand Prize. Kanehito Yamada and Tsukasa Abe's Frieren: Beyond Journey's End  won the New Creator prize, and Hiroko Nobara's Kieta Mama Tomo and Tsuma wa Kuchi o Kiite Kuremasen won the Short Work Prize. The committee also awarded the Special Prize to Koyoharu Gotouge's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba manga.

Short Work Prize  Ii Toshi o (Have a Good Year) and Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai (White Magnolias Do Not Fall Beautifully) Izumi Okaya Ii Toshi o: Kadokawa Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai: Shogakukan Ii Toshi o is set during the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, and centers on 42-year-old Toshio Haida, a person who lives alone and was formerly married. He uses the occasion of his mother's passing to move back in with his 72-year-old father in Tokyo. When he finds the 5 million yen that his mother left him, he wonders what to do with it.    Hakumokuren wa Kirei ni Chiranai centers on three friends since high school, all born in 1963: Housewife Mari, who actually secretly hates cooking and cleaning and doing the laundry; Sayo, a woman in the middle of a divorce, and who has not seen the need to take care of herself even now; and Satoe, a career-minded woman who questions the pressure to have children after marriage. The three meet each other again when their former high school classmate Hiromi dies alone in the apartment she owned, the Hakurensō. For some reason, Hiromi named all three of them in her will, even though they were never close to her.

The awards commemorate the contributions of the manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka (Astro Boy/Mighty Atom, Kimba the White Lion/Jungle Emperor, Phoenix, Black Jack) by recognizing the manga that best follow his tradition.   Grand Prize  Chi -Chikyū no Undō ni Tsuite- (Chi - On the Movements of the Earth) Uoto Shogakukan (Big Comic Spirits, 2020-April 25, 2022) Sparks of the discoveries of the Renaissance are only beginning to burn in 15th century Europe, even as those who make discoveries are burned for their heresy. In Poland, a child prodigy named Rafal is expected to be another great mind in theology, but an encounter with a certain man leads him down the path to a heretical truth.   New Creator Prize  Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru (Youth Begins in a Corner of the Classroom) and Konya Sukiyaki da yo (It's Sukiyaki for Tonight) Natsuko Taniguchi Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru: Kadokawa (Monthly Comic Beam, 2020-2021) Konya Sukiyaki da yo: Shinchosha (Kurage Bunch, April-July 2021) Kyōshitsu no Katasumi de Seishun wa Hajimaru is an omnibus collection centering on youth stories. One  of the stories involves Mari Yoshida, a girl that only becomes the main character for a brief moment, before situations go sideways and she becomes cringe. Meanwhile, the alien Nell has held a dream of wanting to do something on Earth. Also in the classroom are people wanting to hide their otakudom, people who act out their ideal life on social media, and people who have confidence in their special destiny. Every kid in the classroom has their own secret, and you can't even claim to understand the kid right next to you.    Konya Sukiyaki da yo centers on two women in their 30s. Aiko is a freelance interior designer who wants to marry her current boyfriend, but envisions herself as far from the ideal wife, due to her being bad at household chores. Meanwhile, Tomoko is a picture book illustrator that is good at housework, but societal notions of marriage and romance don't hit home for her. They mutually decide that, until they find their perfect marriage partner, that they should get married with each other.
