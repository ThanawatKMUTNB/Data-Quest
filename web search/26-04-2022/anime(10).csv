News Guilty Gear -Strive- Game's 'Another Story' DLC Launches on April 29   posted on 2022-04-23 04:20 UTC-8 by Alex Mateo         DLC launches for season pass 1 holders    Arc System Works announced on Friday that it will launch the new ""Another Story"" DLC story for its Guilty Gear -Strive- fighting game on April 29. The game will launch for season pass 1 holders on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam.     The DLC will feature characters that did not appear in the main story.    The company describes the DLC:  While the incident in America triggered by Asuka R. Kreutz's surrender unfolds…   Special Brigade Commander Ramlethal Valentine heads to the outskirts of Illyria after receiving report of an emergency.    There she finds a girl who closely resembles “Bedman”, who once worked with the Universal Will against mankind.    The company also describes the new character Delilah (pictured above):  A young girl who has awoken from a long slumber.She's lived within a dream since her birth due to a unique condition caused by her brain's inability to withstand her exceptional intellect and abilities.As she's only just woken up, she doesn't have a solid grasp on common sense and social skills. Her one and only motive is to get revenge for her brother's life.  The game launched for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC in June 2021, delayed from April 2021. Arc System Works previously delayed the release of the game from late 2020 due to the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (306 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (306 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (306 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Apr 11th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! ?                     Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is.

A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.    Honestly, more than anything else, watching this episode felt like reading a particularly volatile comment section on a subject I cared nothing about. Instead of addressing each other's points, they change the subject, passively-aggressively attack each other, move the goalposts, and drag other people into it. It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (306 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

It was at the moment the bear started talking that I realized what we were in for—that this argument was going to be our entire episode—and my heart filled with dread.    The only thing that got me through this episode (you know, besides being paid to watch it) was thinking about the simple question: “Is Carla really that dense or is she just messing with everyone?” Because, while it's presented as the former, I'm starting to think it's the latter. The real reason she doesn't have a party is not that she's incompetent, it's that she's a born sadist who gets off on causing people emotional pain. Every move she makes is calculated to get what she wants—be that a new mace or a person to torture. I doubt the so-called “curse” even exists; it's just her way of keeping her new punching bag at arm's length (though, I wouldn't put it past her to put an actual curse on him for the same reason).    Luckily, I am not cursed to remain around Carla nor do I have any reason to watch—much less think about—this series ever again. Good luck, Alvin. I wouldn't wish this hell upon anyone.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               There's nothing objectively offensive about Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!. It's just incredibly annoying. Or rather, Carla, the eponymous healer, is incredibly annoying. The premise, as I understood it prior to going in, is that dark elf Carla is a pretty terrible healer, doing the opposite of helping people despite her class. That may be true, although we don't see much evidence of it in this episode apart from the bit where she curses Alvin instead of healing him. What she is instead is intensely irritating, the anime equivalent of that mosquito that you can hear buzzing around your head in the night but can never quite find to squash. Somehow this is made worse by the fact that she's clearly meant to be funny; her attempts to be cutesy instead come off as grating and her every action is plainly self-serving. When she says that she's never been in a party before and Alvin remarks that, given her personality, that's not surprising, it's the truest statement in the episode.    Carla basically weighs the entire thing down, which is a shame because the show's not without other merits. Bear, the horned bear magibeast Alvin is initially fighting, is at least moderately amusing with the way that she can't seem to settle on a cute verbal affectation, cycling through “kuma,” “gao,” and “bear” with each new utterance. The fact that we never get to see Alvin's entire face is also pretty good, and watching the show come up with new ways to ensure that it's mostly hidden is both a fun poke at censorship via strategically placed item and just generally fun, especially since both Mostly and Carla are under the impression that his face is some sort of horror show of dullness. I also appreciate that Carla's healer outfit is perfectly normal and fully covering, which is unusual for a fantasy show; that it's practical as well is especially nice.    It's just too bad that Carla is so grating, and since she's the main character (or at least one of them, though who knows how long Alvin will last), that's a real problem. This has the unfortunate combination of very little plot, a thus-far uninteresting RPG-inspired fantasy world, and a character who just really rubbed me the wrong way. Your mileage may vary, but this wouldn't be my first choice for something to watch this season, even if you're hurting for any of its purported genres.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               There's nothing quite as unbearable as an unfunny comedy, is there? There have been some stinkers this season, some of them quantifiably worse than Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, but nothing has felt quite as protracted and interminable as watching this premiere hammer its weak, wafer-thin premise into the ground for a full 20 minutes. It has one joke, which is at best mildly funny on paper, and it proceeds to flub telling that joke in what feels like the most excruciating bit of sketch comedy ever made. That it's actually a scripted, fully-animated TV show just makes it harder to sit through.    Ok, there was one joke that kind of got me to smile. The reveal that the generic rhino/bear monster wasn't just some random monster, but a character in her own right and basically the mediator between our two leads, was kind of funny. But the longer it went on the less funny it got, and by the third minute the gag had just folded itself in with the unfunny manzai banter of Alvin and Clara. Thus the one spark of comedic hope in this premiere faded into the night, never to be seen again, and there were still 14 minutes of this sucker to get through. And every joke from then on followed the same formula: Carla says something rude or arrogant, Alvin gets upset. At one point there's a gag about Carla not being able to properly heal his face (which he doesn't actually have) that lasts for eons and repeats the punchline a dozen times before it mercifully ends.    This is just the antithesis of charming comedy for me. It's rote, boring, and repetitive. Half the jokes are just Alvin yelling that Carla is being rude, as if shouting the point of a scene is inherently funny. And since the show is so barebones in art and animation, there's nothing to distract from how unfunny it is. It made for a miserable time, and unless you have a totally different sense of humor, there's nothing here for you.     discuss this in the forum (306 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives   ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 2.5              What is this?   The ""isekai burnt-out adventurer comedy"" centers on two adventurers: the hopeless swordsman Arvin, and the sarcastic dark-elf healer Karla, who seems to be more talented with ticking people off than healing. (from manga)   Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is based on Tannen ni Hakkō's Kono Healer, Mendokusai (This Healer's a Handful) manga and streams on Crunchyroll on Sundays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                Full disclosure: Before getting to the premiere of Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!, I watched the new film Everything Everywhere all at once, and without derailing this review to cover a completely irrelevant and non-anime project, the film left me on Cloud Nine, so much so that I was guaranteed to enjoy practically anything in my post-masterpiece haze. You could have walked up and socked me right in the face, and I probably would have given the experience at least a two out of five. So, take my relatively positive score here with a grain of salt.    I'm not going to pretend that Don't Hurt Me, My Healer! is a great anime, or anything. A lot of its tryhard manzai-style humor is the kind of stuff that I usually find pretty grating, since so much of it boils down to one person acting like a manic lunatic for no particular reason, while the straight-man of the group explains in excruciating detail how their partner's behavior defies conventional expectations. “Wah, I tried to heal you, but I accidentally cursed you instead, because I'm grossly incompetent at my chosen profession!” “Well, that isn't how it was supposed to go!” Insert slide-whistle sound effect here. Still, “comedy is subjective” and all that, and it's my job to be honest with you, so here it goes: This incredibly stupid show made me laugh a few times, and I was never actively bored while I watched it.    In retrospect, a lot of my appreciation of this episode comes from the befuddled bear-thing simply trying to keep the two numbskull humans that it has only just met from self-annihilation-by-way-of-shenanigans. Arvin and Carla are, themselves, not especially hilarious, so a lot of the show's potential will depend on whether the characters they meet every week can balance out the altogether-too-muchness of the pair's whole shtick. Will everyone enjoy Don't Hurt Me, My Healer!? Lord, no. But it might prove to be a decent way to kill a half-hour if nothing else is on.       Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:               You know how they say humor is subjective? Well, for me, this anime is less funny and more like pulling teeth: long, drawn-out, and painful. However, this should be no surprise; it's right there in the title, after all. In Japanese, this show is called “Kono Healer, Mendokusai,” which translates directly to “This Healer is a Pain to Deal With.” And holy crap do I feel that after watching this episode. In fact, it's not just the healer but the warrior and the bear as well; they're all a pain and I didn't enjoy a single moment of this episode.

I braced myself for this since October, but it really happened. She's gone. They say sequels don't live up to the original, but Nan-chan joining fripside and debuting with ""only my railgun"" is one of the greatest sequel debuts ever (one of the top karaoke songs in Japan for years) and then she gave us 12 years of greatness on top of that. Definitely one of the greatest sequels ever. Better than the MCU's Phase 2. Thank you Nan-chan for the great times and thank you Sat for making the right picks.   With that said, Mao and Abe's debut song is good. It feels like fripside didn't miss a beat as expected. Nan-chan has my heart right now, but it will fully accept Mao and Abe with time. Sat just don't miss.

I braced myself for this since October, but it really happened. She's gone. They say sequels don't live up to the original, but Nan-chan joining fripside and debuting with ""only my railgun"" is one of the greatest sequel debuts ever (one of the top karaoke songs in Japan for years) and then she gave us 12 years of greatness on top of that. Definitely one of the greatest sequels ever. Better than the MCU's Phase 2. Thank you Nan-chan for the great times and thank you Sat for making the right picks.   With that said, Mao and Abe's debut song is good. It feels like fripside didn't miss a beat as expected. Nan-chan has my heart right now, but it will fully accept Mao and Abe with time. Sat just don't miss.

I braced myself for this since October, but it really happened. She's gone. They say sequels don't live up to the original, but Nan-chan joining fripside and debuting with ""only my railgun"" is one of the greatest sequel debuts ever (one of the top karaoke songs in Japan for years) and then she gave us 12 years of greatness on top of that. Definitely one of the greatest sequels ever. Better than the MCU's Phase 2. Thank you Nan-chan for the great times and thank you Sat for making the right picks.   With that said, Mao and Abe's debut song is good. It feels like fripside didn't miss a beat as expected. Nan-chan has my heart right now, but it will fully accept Mao and Abe with time. Sat just don't miss.

The video features a story about Shinnosuke's birth, and will be available until May 31.

The June issue of Futabasha's Monthly Manga Town magazine will republish this chapter on May 2.    The film opened in Japan on Friday and debuted at #2 in its first weekend.    The film sees Shinnosuke as a ninja, and teases at the ""mystery of Shinnosuke's birth.""    Masakazu Hashimoto (Tari Tari, Haruchika – Haruta & Chika, Appare-Ranman!) is directing the film, and is also co-writing the script with Crayon Shin-chan anime scriptwriter Kimiko Ueno.  Ryoku Oushoku Shakai performs the film's theme song ""Hi wa Mata Noboru Kara"" (Because the Sun Will Rise Again).    The previous film Eiga Crayon Shin-chan Nazo Meki! Hana no Tenkasu Gakuen (Crayon Shin-chan the Movie - Shrouded in Mystery! The Flowers of Tenkazu Academy) opened in July 2021. The film was originally slated to open in Japan in April 2021, but was delayed due to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The film debuted at #2.

News 30th Crayon Shin-chan Film's 1st 5 Minutes Streamed   posted on 2022-04-25 17:31 UTC-8 by Crystalyn Hodgkins         Opening scene in film is based on chapter from 16th volume of original manga    TOHO began streaming the first five minutes on Monday for Eiga Crayon Shin-chan Mononoke Ninja Chinpūden, the Crayon Shin-chan series' 30th film. The video features a story about Shinnosuke's birth, and will be available until May 31.      The birth scene in the film is based on a chapter from the 16th volume of Yoshito Usui's Crayon Shin-chan manga. The June issue of Futabasha's Monthly Manga Town magazine will republish this chapter on May 2.    The film opened in Japan on Friday and debuted at #2 in its first weekend.    The film sees Shinnosuke as a ninja, and teases at the ""mystery of Shinnosuke's birth.""    Masakazu Hashimoto (Tari Tari, Haruchika – Haruta & Chika, Appare-Ranman!) is directing the film, and is also co-writing the script with Crayon Shin-chan anime scriptwriter Kimiko Ueno.  Ryoku Oushoku Shakai performs the film's theme song ""Hi wa Mata Noboru Kara"" (Because the Sun Will Rise Again).    The previous film Eiga Crayon Shin-chan Nazo Meki! Hana no Tenkasu Gakuen (Crayon Shin-chan the Movie - Shrouded in Mystery! The Flowers of Tenkazu Academy) opened in July 2021. The film was originally slated to open in Japan in April 2021, but was delayed due to the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The film debuted at #2.

Heidi breaks down what to expect. ― Greetings, everyone! I am quite relieved today, as it was very likely TWIG might not have happened this week.

Kind of. So, who won? ― Hey folks! By the time you read this, the internet will be on the cusp of going completely bonkers over Deltarune Chapter 2.

My reception to the series has only grown more positive as each volume expands its world, broadens its cast, and enriches its conceptual landscape. This volume was my favorite by far, and honestly I can't wait to see what's next.

Nijigasaki High School Idol Club Season 2 ‒ Episode 4   Apr 25, 05:30 4 comments                 anime    This is a remarkably somber and emotional setup for a franchise that's most at home with breezy humor and heavy melodrama. But it also feels like it's trying to do too much in too little time.                    ep. review          38 comments       The Executioner and Her Way of Life ‒ Episode 4   Apr 25, 04:30 38 comments                 anime    The episode manages that rare feat of dumping a lot of lore and whatnot on us throughout the flashback without ever getting lost in the sea of proper nouns and vague world-building like so many other shows do.                    ep. review          38 comments       Spy×Family ‒ Episode 3   Apr 25, 03:30 38 comments                 anime    What Loid's coming to learn in this episode isn't that Anya's going to be a kid no matter what, it's that having to rely on others to complete a sensitive mission may not be quite the walk in the park he thought it would be.                    review          10 comments       Sakamoto Days GN 1   Apr 25, 00:00 10 comments                 manga    A retired assassin finds domestic bliss and opens a convenience store, but the crime world isn't ready to let Sakamoto go. ― Taro Sakamoto was once the most feared assassin in Japan...until he fell in love.

The thing is, you're thinking about this premise with logic, and logic has no home in this manga. This manga runs off of pure, lovestruck insanity. ― Now I know what you're probably thinking, just from looking at that title. 100? Really?

Their rough-and-tumble days of excitement are far in the past but maybe a new kind of excitement is awaiting them? ― An obvious element of the appeal of murata's Catch These Hands is one of contrast—that despite the nominally rough-and-tumble subject matter, the story contained within is actually adorable and sweet as hell.

Dance Dance Danseur Episodes 1-3  by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.6                  How would you rate episode 3 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 4.1           Dance Dance Danseur isn't going to work for everyone. The anime does a staggeringly impressive job of adapting the art of manga creator George Asakura, a style characterized by heavy-lidded eyes that give all the characters an almost dreamy-like quality. It's uncharacteristic of most character designs we see in anime right now, and I expect viewers will either embrace these long-limbed, sleepy kids or bounce off of it. Then there's the niche interest of ballet, something I have no professional background to offer other than watching performances with my mom around Christmastime and any residual respect I've picked up from knowing a few dancers in my time. Dance Dance Danseur has the hurdle of selling ballet to a seinen audience with a male lead. It's that launching point that infuses the series with its primary conflict, because Jumpei's denial about his passion for dance is symptomatic of the same environment: there is little considered more strictly feminine than ballet.    Jumpei knows this, and it's why he's funneled his energy into martial arts and dedicated himself to taking up his father's career as a stuntman all the while adopting a lackadaisical attitude about dance. His demeanor will likely be off-putting to many. He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little shit. In short, Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy. I knew my fair share of guys where everything was a joke and anything resembling genuine honesty or vulnerability was grounds to be mocked. Likewise, Jumpei has adopted a ""what's the big deal?"" approach to life as a defense mechanism that is not at all subtle when you recognize it. We see moments when he drops the pretense, but the kid still has a lot of growing to do to reconcile his passion for dance and the expectations of his peers.    Some of that pressure is self-imposed. He's maintained a façade for so long that it will be difficult for him to change course without upending his social life. His family – mainly his mother and sister – are supportive of his interest and mostly just waiting for him to admit it. By the end of episode two, it's less about Jumpei being honest about what he wants to do with his time and more masculinity-charged jealousy and one-upmanship that pushes him forward. This is spurred by the introduction of Luou, Miyako's cousin and a ballet prodigy. Jumpei has caught feelings for Miyako already, so he feels challenged by her familiarity with Luou as well as his dance abilities. It doesn't help that Luou has the stereotypical ""cool savant"" personality that makes him aloof and generally disconnected from his peers. Jumpei intends to throw in the towel, because at this point he is still looking for a legitimate excuse to abandon ballet and go back to an interest that won't potentially subject him to ridicule.    Then episode three happens and it recontextualizes Luou and challenges Jumpei's simplistic ideas of masculinity. After Luou begins attending classes, his antisocial demeanor, as well as the idle gossip perpetuated by Jumpei, puts a target on his back and he quickly becomes the punching bag of Jumpei's social group. The classes quickly learn that Luou's mother is a former idol who was involved in romantic scandals that included cheating on her spouse. The likely product of an affair, Luou is sent to live with his grandmother but something obviously happened there too, because he currently lives with Miyako and her mom. He seems to have had little to no formal academic education and the physical reflects of a kid who was likely raised in an abusive environment, if not outright abused himself. And now the soccer club is capitalizing on that in what ultimately culminates in one of the worst bullying situations I've seen in an anime in a long time.    Throughout all of this Jumpei remains conflict-averse and it becomes ever more apparent that most of his decisions up to this point – flippancy about ballet, sabotaging his relationship with Miyako, and remaining a bystander to ongoing abuse of a classmate – has nothing to do with choosing to be ""cool"" or ""manly"" but the exact opposite: like a lot of kids, or really people, Jumpei is a coward. It takes Luou turning a hazing situation into a ballet performance in a girl's school uniform for Jumpei to reevaluate himself deeply. He's seen the true nature of his group of fuck-around friends and they're not empathetic people, hell they aren't even baseline nice people. The appearance he was keeping up for their sake proves to not be worth it as Jumpei adopts an impossibly dorky means of breaking up with them and finally committing to ballet.    Sticking it through this series with Jumpei is difficult because we're used to stories where characters do the right thing, if not right away, then nearly immediately. There were many times when I expected Jumpei to finally step in because his friends, not random bullies but people he hung out with every day, were terrorizing another student. Regardless of how I might be disappointed in a character for not rising to the moment when someone else needed it, I do think his actions are, unfortunately, realistic. That doesn't mean there isn't hope for him yet, but it seems just as likely that Jumpei rebuking his old friends' actions will cause them to change targets.    Visually, MAPPA is putting out another great show this season. Dance Dance Danseur is consistently gorgeous, especially when it features any kind of dance sequence. The movements are exceptionally fluid in what may often be rotoscoped animation for the ballet sequences. The classroom scenes and character designs look great given that Asakura's style could be hard to keep consistent from scene to scene. Also, in a season full of amazing OPs, this is one of my top three. There's a great use of perspective shots as Jumpei, Miyako, and Luou see each other from across campus followed by a kaleidoscope of ballet. Great stuff.

Dance Dance Danseur Episodes 1-3  by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.6                  How would you rate episode 3 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 4.1           Dance Dance Danseur isn't going to work for everyone. The anime does a staggeringly impressive job of adapting the art of manga creator George Asakura, a style characterized by heavy-lidded eyes that give all the characters an almost dreamy-like quality. It's uncharacteristic of most character designs we see in anime right now, and I expect viewers will either embrace these long-limbed, sleepy kids or bounce off of it. Then there's the niche interest of ballet, something I have no professional background to offer other than watching performances with my mom around Christmastime and any residual respect I've picked up from knowing a few dancers in my time. Dance Dance Danseur has the hurdle of selling ballet to a seinen audience with a male lead. It's that launching point that infuses the series with its primary conflict, because Jumpei's denial about his passion for dance is symptomatic of the same environment: there is little considered more strictly feminine than ballet.    Jumpei knows this, and it's why he's funneled his energy into martial arts and dedicated himself to taking up his father's career as a stuntman all the while adopting a lackadaisical attitude about dance. His demeanor will likely be off-putting to many. He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little shit. In short, Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy. I knew my fair share of guys where everything was a joke and anything resembling genuine honesty or vulnerability was grounds to be mocked. Likewise, Jumpei has adopted a ""what's the big deal?"" approach to life as a defense mechanism that is not at all subtle when you recognize it. We see moments when he drops the pretense, but the kid still has a lot of growing to do to reconcile his passion for dance and the expectations of his peers.    Some of that pressure is self-imposed. He's maintained a façade for so long that it will be difficult for him to change course without upending his social life. His family – mainly his mother and sister – are supportive of his interest and mostly just waiting for him to admit it. By the end of episode two, it's less about Jumpei being honest about what he wants to do with his time and more masculinity-charged jealousy and one-upmanship that pushes him forward. This is spurred by the introduction of Luou, Miyako's cousin and a ballet prodigy. Jumpei has caught feelings for Miyako already, so he feels challenged by her familiarity with Luou as well as his dance abilities. It doesn't help that Luou has the stereotypical ""cool savant"" personality that makes him aloof and generally disconnected from his peers. Jumpei intends to throw in the towel, because at this point he is still looking for a legitimate excuse to abandon ballet and go back to an interest that won't potentially subject him to ridicule.    Then episode three happens and it recontextualizes Luou and challenges Jumpei's simplistic ideas of masculinity. After Luou begins attending classes, his antisocial demeanor, as well as the idle gossip perpetuated by Jumpei, puts a target on his back and he quickly becomes the punching bag of Jumpei's social group. The classes quickly learn that Luou's mother is a former idol who was involved in romantic scandals that included cheating on her spouse. The likely product of an affair, Luou is sent to live with his grandmother but something obviously happened there too, because he currently lives with Miyako and her mom. He seems to have had little to no formal academic education and the physical reflects of a kid who was likely raised in an abusive environment, if not outright abused himself. And now the soccer club is capitalizing on that in what ultimately culminates in one of the worst bullying situations I've seen in an anime in a long time.    Throughout all of this Jumpei remains conflict-averse and it becomes ever more apparent that most of his decisions up to this point – flippancy about ballet, sabotaging his relationship with Miyako, and remaining a bystander to ongoing abuse of a classmate – has nothing to do with choosing to be ""cool"" or ""manly"" but the exact opposite: like a lot of kids, or really people, Jumpei is a coward. It takes Luou turning a hazing situation into a ballet performance in a girl's school uniform for Jumpei to reevaluate himself deeply. He's seen the true nature of his group of fuck-around friends and they're not empathetic people, hell they aren't even baseline nice people. The appearance he was keeping up for their sake proves to not be worth it as Jumpei adopts an impossibly dorky means of breaking up with them and finally committing to ballet.    Sticking it through this series with Jumpei is difficult because we're used to stories where characters do the right thing, if not right away, then nearly immediately. There were many times when I expected Jumpei to finally step in because his friends, not random bullies but people he hung out with every day, were terrorizing another student. Regardless of how I might be disappointed in a character for not rising to the moment when someone else needed it, I do think his actions are, unfortunately, realistic. That doesn't mean there isn't hope for him yet, but it seems just as likely that Jumpei rebuking his old friends' actions will cause them to change targets.    Visually, MAPPA is putting out another great show this season. Dance Dance Danseur is consistently gorgeous, especially when it features any kind of dance sequence. The movements are exceptionally fluid in what may often be rotoscoped animation for the ballet sequences. The classroom scenes and character designs look great given that Asakura's style could be hard to keep consistent from scene to scene. Also, in a season full of amazing OPs, this is one of my top three. There's a great use of perspective shots as Jumpei, Miyako, and Luou see each other from across campus followed by a kaleidoscope of ballet. Great stuff.

Dance Dance Danseur Episodes 1-3  by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.6                  How would you rate episode 3 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 4.1           Dance Dance Danseur isn't going to work for everyone. The anime does a staggeringly impressive job of adapting the art of manga creator George Asakura, a style characterized by heavy-lidded eyes that give all the characters an almost dreamy-like quality. It's uncharacteristic of most character designs we see in anime right now, and I expect viewers will either embrace these long-limbed, sleepy kids or bounce off of it. Then there's the niche interest of ballet, something I have no professional background to offer other than watching performances with my mom around Christmastime and any residual respect I've picked up from knowing a few dancers in my time. Dance Dance Danseur has the hurdle of selling ballet to a seinen audience with a male lead. It's that launching point that infuses the series with its primary conflict, because Jumpei's denial about his passion for dance is symptomatic of the same environment: there is little considered more strictly feminine than ballet.    Jumpei knows this, and it's why he's funneled his energy into martial arts and dedicated himself to taking up his father's career as a stuntman all the while adopting a lackadaisical attitude about dance. His demeanor will likely be off-putting to many. He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little shit. In short, Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy. I knew my fair share of guys where everything was a joke and anything resembling genuine honesty or vulnerability was grounds to be mocked. Likewise, Jumpei has adopted a ""what's the big deal?"" approach to life as a defense mechanism that is not at all subtle when you recognize it. We see moments when he drops the pretense, but the kid still has a lot of growing to do to reconcile his passion for dance and the expectations of his peers.    Some of that pressure is self-imposed. He's maintained a façade for so long that it will be difficult for him to change course without upending his social life. His family – mainly his mother and sister – are supportive of his interest and mostly just waiting for him to admit it. By the end of episode two, it's less about Jumpei being honest about what he wants to do with his time and more masculinity-charged jealousy and one-upmanship that pushes him forward. This is spurred by the introduction of Luou, Miyako's cousin and a ballet prodigy. Jumpei has caught feelings for Miyako already, so he feels challenged by her familiarity with Luou as well as his dance abilities. It doesn't help that Luou has the stereotypical ""cool savant"" personality that makes him aloof and generally disconnected from his peers. Jumpei intends to throw in the towel, because at this point he is still looking for a legitimate excuse to abandon ballet and go back to an interest that won't potentially subject him to ridicule.    Then episode three happens and it recontextualizes Luou and challenges Jumpei's simplistic ideas of masculinity. After Luou begins attending classes, his antisocial demeanor, as well as the idle gossip perpetuated by Jumpei, puts a target on his back and he quickly becomes the punching bag of Jumpei's social group. The classes quickly learn that Luou's mother is a former idol who was involved in romantic scandals that included cheating on her spouse. The likely product of an affair, Luou is sent to live with his grandmother but something obviously happened there too, because he currently lives with Miyako and her mom. He seems to have had little to no formal academic education and the physical reflects of a kid who was likely raised in an abusive environment, if not outright abused himself. And now the soccer club is capitalizing on that in what ultimately culminates in one of the worst bullying situations I've seen in an anime in a long time.    Throughout all of this Jumpei remains conflict-averse and it becomes ever more apparent that most of his decisions up to this point – flippancy about ballet, sabotaging his relationship with Miyako, and remaining a bystander to ongoing abuse of a classmate – has nothing to do with choosing to be ""cool"" or ""manly"" but the exact opposite: like a lot of kids, or really people, Jumpei is a coward. It takes Luou turning a hazing situation into a ballet performance in a girl's school uniform for Jumpei to reevaluate himself deeply. He's seen the true nature of his group of fuck-around friends and they're not empathetic people, hell they aren't even baseline nice people. The appearance he was keeping up for their sake proves to not be worth it as Jumpei adopts an impossibly dorky means of breaking up with them and finally committing to ballet.    Sticking it through this series with Jumpei is difficult because we're used to stories where characters do the right thing, if not right away, then nearly immediately. There were many times when I expected Jumpei to finally step in because his friends, not random bullies but people he hung out with every day, were terrorizing another student. Regardless of how I might be disappointed in a character for not rising to the moment when someone else needed it, I do think his actions are, unfortunately, realistic. That doesn't mean there isn't hope for him yet, but it seems just as likely that Jumpei rebuking his old friends' actions will cause them to change targets.    Visually, MAPPA is putting out another great show this season. Dance Dance Danseur is consistently gorgeous, especially when it features any kind of dance sequence. The movements are exceptionally fluid in what may often be rotoscoped animation for the ballet sequences. The classroom scenes and character designs look great given that Asakura's style could be hard to keep consistent from scene to scene. Also, in a season full of amazing OPs, this is one of my top three. There's a great use of perspective shots as Jumpei, Miyako, and Luou see each other from across campus followed by a kaleidoscope of ballet. Great stuff.

Dance Dance Danseur Episodes 1-3  by Lynzee Loveridge, Apr 26th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.6                  How would you rate episode 3 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 4.1           Dance Dance Danseur isn't going to work for everyone. The anime does a staggeringly impressive job of adapting the art of manga creator George Asakura, a style characterized by heavy-lidded eyes that give all the characters an almost dreamy-like quality. It's uncharacteristic of most character designs we see in anime right now, and I expect viewers will either embrace these long-limbed, sleepy kids or bounce off of it. Then there's the niche interest of ballet, something I have no professional background to offer other than watching performances with my mom around Christmastime and any residual respect I've picked up from knowing a few dancers in my time. Dance Dance Danseur has the hurdle of selling ballet to a seinen audience with a male lead. It's that launching point that infuses the series with its primary conflict, because Jumpei's denial about his passion for dance is symptomatic of the same environment: there is little considered more strictly feminine than ballet.    Jumpei knows this, and it's why he's funneled his energy into martial arts and dedicated himself to taking up his father's career as a stuntman all the while adopting a lackadaisical attitude about dance. His demeanor will likely be off-putting to many. He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little shit. In short, Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy. I knew my fair share of guys where everything was a joke and anything resembling genuine honesty or vulnerability was grounds to be mocked. Likewise, Jumpei has adopted a ""what's the big deal?"" approach to life as a defense mechanism that is not at all subtle when you recognize it. We see moments when he drops the pretense, but the kid still has a lot of growing to do to reconcile his passion for dance and the expectations of his peers.    Some of that pressure is self-imposed. He's maintained a façade for so long that it will be difficult for him to change course without upending his social life. His family – mainly his mother and sister – are supportive of his interest and mostly just waiting for him to admit it. By the end of episode two, it's less about Jumpei being honest about what he wants to do with his time and more masculinity-charged jealousy and one-upmanship that pushes him forward. This is spurred by the introduction of Luou, Miyako's cousin and a ballet prodigy. Jumpei has caught feelings for Miyako already, so he feels challenged by her familiarity with Luou as well as his dance abilities. It doesn't help that Luou has the stereotypical ""cool savant"" personality that makes him aloof and generally disconnected from his peers. Jumpei intends to throw in the towel, because at this point he is still looking for a legitimate excuse to abandon ballet and go back to an interest that won't potentially subject him to ridicule.    Then episode three happens and it recontextualizes Luou and challenges Jumpei's simplistic ideas of masculinity. After Luou begins attending classes, his antisocial demeanor, as well as the idle gossip perpetuated by Jumpei, puts a target on his back and he quickly becomes the punching bag of Jumpei's social group. The classes quickly learn that Luou's mother is a former idol who was involved in romantic scandals that included cheating on her spouse. The likely product of an affair, Luou is sent to live with his grandmother but something obviously happened there too, because he currently lives with Miyako and her mom. He seems to have had little to no formal academic education and the physical reflects of a kid who was likely raised in an abusive environment, if not outright abused himself. And now the soccer club is capitalizing on that in what ultimately culminates in one of the worst bullying situations I've seen in an anime in a long time.    Throughout all of this Jumpei remains conflict-averse and it becomes ever more apparent that most of his decisions up to this point – flippancy about ballet, sabotaging his relationship with Miyako, and remaining a bystander to ongoing abuse of a classmate – has nothing to do with choosing to be ""cool"" or ""manly"" but the exact opposite: like a lot of kids, or really people, Jumpei is a coward. It takes Luou turning a hazing situation into a ballet performance in a girl's school uniform for Jumpei to reevaluate himself deeply. He's seen the true nature of his group of fuck-around friends and they're not empathetic people, hell they aren't even baseline nice people. The appearance he was keeping up for their sake proves to not be worth it as Jumpei adopts an impossibly dorky means of breaking up with them and finally committing to ballet.    Sticking it through this series with Jumpei is difficult because we're used to stories where characters do the right thing, if not right away, then nearly immediately. There were many times when I expected Jumpei to finally step in because his friends, not random bullies but people he hung out with every day, were terrorizing another student. Regardless of how I might be disappointed in a character for not rising to the moment when someone else needed it, I do think his actions are, unfortunately, realistic. That doesn't mean there isn't hope for him yet, but it seems just as likely that Jumpei rebuking his old friends' actions will cause them to change targets.    Visually, MAPPA is putting out another great show this season. Dance Dance Danseur is consistently gorgeous, especially when it features any kind of dance sequence. The movements are exceptionally fluid in what may often be rotoscoped animation for the ballet sequences. The classroom scenes and character designs look great given that Asakura's style could be hard to keep consistent from scene to scene. Also, in a season full of amazing OPs, this is one of my top three. There's a great use of perspective shots as Jumpei, Miyako, and Luou see each other from across campus followed by a kaleidoscope of ballet. Great stuff.

After Luou begins attending classes, his antisocial demeanor, as well as the idle gossip perpetuated by Jumpei, puts a target on his back and he quickly becomes the punching bag of Jumpei's social group. The classes quickly learn that Luou's mother is a former idol who was involved in romantic scandals that included cheating on her spouse. The likely product of an affair, Luou is sent to live with his grandmother but something obviously happened there too, because he currently lives with Miyako and her mom. He seems to have had little to no formal academic education and the physical reflects of a kid who was likely raised in an abusive environment, if not outright abused himself. And now the soccer club is capitalizing on that in what ultimately culminates in one of the worst bullying situations I've seen in an anime in a long time.    Throughout all of this Jumpei remains conflict-averse and it becomes ever more apparent that most of his decisions up to this point – flippancy about ballet, sabotaging his relationship with Miyako, and remaining a bystander to ongoing abuse of a classmate – has nothing to do with choosing to be ""cool"" or ""manly"" but the exact opposite: like a lot of kids, or really people, Jumpei is a coward. It takes Luou turning a hazing situation into a ballet performance in a girl's school uniform for Jumpei to reevaluate himself deeply. He's seen the true nature of his group of fuck-around friends and they're not empathetic people, hell they aren't even baseline nice people. The appearance he was keeping up for their sake proves to not be worth it as Jumpei adopts an impossibly dorky means of breaking up with them and finally committing to ballet.    Sticking it through this series with Jumpei is difficult because we're used to stories where characters do the right thing, if not right away, then nearly immediately. There were many times when I expected Jumpei to finally step in because his friends, not random bullies but people he hung out with every day, were terrorizing another student. Regardless of how I might be disappointed in a character for not rising to the moment when someone else needed it, I do think his actions are, unfortunately, realistic. That doesn't mean there isn't hope for him yet, but it seems just as likely that Jumpei rebuking his old friends' actions will cause them to change targets.    Visually, MAPPA is putting out another great show this season. Dance Dance Danseur is consistently gorgeous, especially when it features any kind of dance sequence. The movements are exceptionally fluid in what may often be rotoscoped animation for the ballet sequences. The classroom scenes and character designs look great given that Asakura's style could be hard to keep consistent from scene to scene. Also, in a season full of amazing OPs, this is one of my top three. There's a great use of perspective shots as Jumpei, Miyako, and Luou see each other from across campus followed by a kaleidoscope of ballet. Great stuff.

Community score: 3.8                  How would you rate episode 2 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 3.6                  How would you rate episode 3 of Dance Dance Danseur ?                     Community score: 4.1           Dance Dance Danseur isn't going to work for everyone. The anime does a staggeringly impressive job of adapting the art of manga creator George Asakura, a style characterized by heavy-lidded eyes that give all the characters an almost dreamy-like quality. It's uncharacteristic of most character designs we see in anime right now, and I expect viewers will either embrace these long-limbed, sleepy kids or bounce off of it. Then there's the niche interest of ballet, something I have no professional background to offer other than watching performances with my mom around Christmastime and any residual respect I've picked up from knowing a few dancers in my time. Dance Dance Danseur has the hurdle of selling ballet to a seinen audience with a male lead. It's that launching point that infuses the series with its primary conflict, because Jumpei's denial about his passion for dance is symptomatic of the same environment: there is little considered more strictly feminine than ballet.    Jumpei knows this, and it's why he's funneled his energy into martial arts and dedicated himself to taking up his father's career as a stuntman all the while adopting a lackadaisical attitude about dance. His demeanor will likely be off-putting to many. He's being dishonest with himself, flippant with Miyako Godai when he isn't disregarding her support as romantic interest, and is otherwise an all-around little shit. In short, Jumpei is a very typical middle school boy. I knew my fair share of guys where everything was a joke and anything resembling genuine honesty or vulnerability was grounds to be mocked. Likewise, Jumpei has adopted a ""what's the big deal?"" approach to life as a defense mechanism that is not at all subtle when you recognize it. We see moments when he drops the pretense, but the kid still has a lot of growing to do to reconcile his passion for dance and the expectations of his peers.    Some of that pressure is self-imposed. He's maintained a façade for so long that it will be difficult for him to change course without upending his social life. His family – mainly his mother and sister – are supportive of his interest and mostly just waiting for him to admit it. By the end of episode two, it's less about Jumpei being honest about what he wants to do with his time and more masculinity-charged jealousy and one-upmanship that pushes him forward. This is spurred by the introduction of Luou, Miyako's cousin and a ballet prodigy. Jumpei has caught feelings for Miyako already, so he feels challenged by her familiarity with Luou as well as his dance abilities. It doesn't help that Luou has the stereotypical ""cool savant"" personality that makes him aloof and generally disconnected from his peers.
