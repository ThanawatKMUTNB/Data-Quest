Of course he’s nowhere near normal – he’s the hero of  Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, Jujutsu Kaisen), a dark fantasy manga by Gege Akutami (芥見下々, Akutami Gege) with a 24-episode anime series by MAPPA. Set in a world where sorcerers must fight deadly curses born of negative emotions,  Jujutsu Kaisen combines its dark premise with a refreshing modern setting, relatable characters and of course, plenty of action. Read on to learn more about the world of  Jujutsu Kaisen, along with its characters, keywords and more! Contents1. Story2. Setting3. Characters- 3.1 Jujutsu High students- 3.2 Jujutsu High faculty- 3.3 Antagonists4. Keywords5. Main media- 5.1 Manga- 5.2 TV anime series- 5.3 Anime film StoryDespite being blessed with extraordinary athleticism, fifteen-year-old Yuji Itadori refuses to have anything to do with his high school’s track team. His choice? The Occult Research Club. However, his world is thrown into chaos when a cursed talisman in the form of a rotting finger is unsealed at school. To protect his friends, Yuji swallows the finger, which is actually a fragment of legendary ""King of Curses"" Ryomen Sukuna, and becomes possessed himself. Although this effectively signs his death warrant, the intervention of powerful sorcerer Satoru Gojo sets him on a different path: to consume the rest of Sukuna’s fingers so he can destroy the curse – and himself – forever.  SettingTo be human is to experience not only positive feelings, but also negative emotions like sadness, regret and shame. In  Jujutsu Kaisen, such emotions produce cursed energy, which transforms into curses that can bring misfortune to the world. While normal humans cannot control this, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to harness their own cursed energy to use certain techniques. With their supernatural powers, these sorcerers secretly protect humans from curses and the threats they pose to society. Characters – Jujutsu High studentsYuji Itadori (虎杖 悠仁, Itadori Yūji)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA fifteen-year-old with extraordinary athleticism. Good-natured and always willing to help those around him, Yuji particularly values the importance of life and having a “fair death”, which was instilled in him by his dead grandfather. As a result, he eats Sukuna’s finger to save his friends and thus becomes the present-day vessel of the “King of Curses.” He then enrolls in Jujutsu High to become a sorcerer himself under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Through lessons and missions, he learns more about cursed energy and how to control it, boosting his already impressive physical abilities. He is voiced by Junya Enoki (Japanese) and Adam McArthur (English). Megumi Fushiguro (伏黒恵, Fushiguro Megumi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student. Megumi’s search for a cursed object leads him to meet Yuji and witness his self-sacrifice first-hand, despite them being strangers. Secretive and calculating, he nevertheless believes in helping those who are good and kind, as seen when he vouches for Yuji in the face of the latter’s impending execution. The two are later reunited as fellow students under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Megumi’s sorcery talents include summoning Shikigami (spirits) for offense and exorcisms. He is voiced by Yuma Uchida (Japanese) and Robbie Daymond (English).Nobara Kugisaki (釘崎野薔薇, Kugisaki Nobara)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student hailing from the country. As one of Satoru’s students, she teams up with Yuji and Megumi for various missions. Self-confident and quick to speak her mind, she takes pride in her own identity, abilities and appearance. Nobara’s distinctive battle style includes the use of hammers and nails infused with cursed energy.  She is voiced by Asami Seto (Japanese) and Anne Yatco (English).Maki Zen'in (禪院真希, Zen'in Maki)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the event with their sister school in Kyoto. Despite being born to a clan of elite Jujutsu Sorcerers, Maki doesn't have the ability to control cursed energy or even see curses. However, she compensates for this with amazing physical strength and talent with all sorts of cursed tools. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu (Japanese) and Allegra Clark (English).Toge Inumaki (狗巻棘, Inumaki Toge)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event. His power is channeled through cursed speech – words imbued with his cursed energy. To ensure that his abilities don't affect people in everyday situations, he only uses words that can be fillings for rice balls. He is voiced by Koki Uchiyama (Japanese) and Xander Mobus (English).Panda (パンダ, Panda)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event with Maki and Toge. Despite his appearance as a full-sized panda, he can speak like a human and is also an exceptionally powerful sorcerer. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki (Japanese) and Matthew David Rudd (English). – Jujutsu High facultySatoru Gojo (五条悟, Gojō Satoru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful sorcerer and teacher who mentors Yuji, Megumi and Nobara. After Yuji is sentenced to death for being possessed by Sukuna, Satoru proposes that they wait until all of the fingers are consumed, which would give them the chance to destroy Sukuna once and for all. He is renowned for his immense power and battle prowess to the point that his self-proclamation of being the world’s strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer goes unchallenged. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese) and Kaiji Tang (English).Masamichi Yaga (夜蛾正道, Yaga Masamichi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteJujutsu High's principal and a passionate educator who once mentored Gojo. He has the ability to bring dolls to life and control them through his cursed corpse technique. He is voiced by Takaya Kuroda (Japanese) and Keith Silverstein (English). – AntagonistsRyomen Sukuna (両面宿儺, Ryōmen Sukuna)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA legendary curse inhabiting Yuji’s body. Also translated as ""Double Faced Specter."" Known as the ""King of Curses"", Sukuna resisted all exorcism attempts, driving sorcerers of centuries ago to cut off and hide his 20 fingers in order to seal his power. His character has roots in Japanese legend, with references to a two-faced, 8-armed and 8-legged man with supernatural strength in Nihon Shoki, the second oldest book of Japanese history. He is voiced by Junichi Suwabe (Japanese), and Ray Chase (English).Suguru Geto (夏油 傑, Getō Suguru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer who wishes to transform the world into a ""paradise"" that would house sorcerers only. He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai (Japanese) and Lex Lang (English).Jogo (漏瑚, Jōgo)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the earth. He believes that his own kind is humanity's true form because cursed spirits originate from pure emotion, as opposed to humans and their false emotions. He is voiced by Shigeru Chiba (Japanese) and Michael Sorich (English).Hanami (花御, Hanami)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the forests. They wish to eliminate humans so they stop hurting the environment. They are voiced by Atsuko Tanaka. Keywords – Curses (呪い, noroi) / Cursed Spirits (呪霊, jurei) Spiritual beings given form by cursed energy (see below). Particularly likely to manifest in places like hospitals and schools, they are the cause of countless mysterious deaths and disappearances in general society, with regular people unable to see them. However, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see, fight and exorcise them. Curses vary greatly in appearance and power, and are ranked by strength with Grades 1-4 (4 being the weakest) and Special Grade (the very strongest). They may also be sealed in artifacts as Sukuna was, becoming cursed objects (呪物, jubutsu) that can still emit cursed energy.  – Cursed Energy (呪力, juryoku)A form of energy that arises from humans’ negative emotions, like hate, regret, and shame, and gives form to curses. While regular people are unable to control it, Jujutsu Sorcerers (see below) and curses are able to harness their own cursed energy for combat.  – Jujutsu Sorcerer (呪術師, jujutsu-shi)Individuals who have been trained to combat curses using Jujutsu spells and techniques at one of Japan’s two recognized Jujutsu educational institutions. They are tasked with various missions, the difficulty of which should match their grade as a sorcerer, with Grade 4 being the lowest and Special Grade being the highest. These duties may involve exorcising curses, investigating curse-related incidents, and so on.  – Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School (東京都立呪術高等専門学校, Tōkyo Toritsu Jujutsu Senmon Gakkō)A 4-year institution where aspiring Jujutsu Sorcerers gather to train their craft. It can also be translated as Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical School and abbreviated as Jujutsu High. One of Japan’s only two Jujutsu schools, it is located in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the other (its sister school) located in Kyoto. However, it is disguised as a religious school and is further hidden and protected from outside threats by a protective barrier. It is common for fully-fledged sorcerers to come back to Jujutsu High to teach students, as well as manage and support missions.

Of course he’s nowhere near normal – he’s the hero of  Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, Jujutsu Kaisen), a dark fantasy manga by Gege Akutami (芥見下々, Akutami Gege) with a 24-episode anime series by MAPPA. Set in a world where sorcerers must fight deadly curses born of negative emotions,  Jujutsu Kaisen combines its dark premise with a refreshing modern setting, relatable characters and of course, plenty of action. Read on to learn more about the world of  Jujutsu Kaisen, along with its characters, keywords and more! Contents1. Story2. Setting3. Characters- 3.1 Jujutsu High students- 3.2 Jujutsu High faculty- 3.3 Antagonists4. Keywords5. Main media- 5.1 Manga- 5.2 TV anime series- 5.3 Anime film StoryDespite being blessed with extraordinary athleticism, fifteen-year-old Yuji Itadori refuses to have anything to do with his high school’s track team. His choice? The Occult Research Club. However, his world is thrown into chaos when a cursed talisman in the form of a rotting finger is unsealed at school. To protect his friends, Yuji swallows the finger, which is actually a fragment of legendary ""King of Curses"" Ryomen Sukuna, and becomes possessed himself. Although this effectively signs his death warrant, the intervention of powerful sorcerer Satoru Gojo sets him on a different path: to consume the rest of Sukuna’s fingers so he can destroy the curse – and himself – forever.  SettingTo be human is to experience not only positive feelings, but also negative emotions like sadness, regret and shame. In  Jujutsu Kaisen, such emotions produce cursed energy, which transforms into curses that can bring misfortune to the world. While normal humans cannot control this, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to harness their own cursed energy to use certain techniques. With their supernatural powers, these sorcerers secretly protect humans from curses and the threats they pose to society. Characters – Jujutsu High studentsYuji Itadori (虎杖 悠仁, Itadori Yūji)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA fifteen-year-old with extraordinary athleticism. Good-natured and always willing to help those around him, Yuji particularly values the importance of life and having a “fair death”, which was instilled in him by his dead grandfather. As a result, he eats Sukuna’s finger to save his friends and thus becomes the present-day vessel of the “King of Curses.” He then enrolls in Jujutsu High to become a sorcerer himself under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Through lessons and missions, he learns more about cursed energy and how to control it, boosting his already impressive physical abilities. He is voiced by Junya Enoki (Japanese) and Adam McArthur (English). Megumi Fushiguro (伏黒恵, Fushiguro Megumi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student. Megumi’s search for a cursed object leads him to meet Yuji and witness his self-sacrifice first-hand, despite them being strangers. Secretive and calculating, he nevertheless believes in helping those who are good and kind, as seen when he vouches for Yuji in the face of the latter’s impending execution. The two are later reunited as fellow students under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Megumi’s sorcery talents include summoning Shikigami (spirits) for offense and exorcisms. He is voiced by Yuma Uchida (Japanese) and Robbie Daymond (English).Nobara Kugisaki (釘崎野薔薇, Kugisaki Nobara)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student hailing from the country. As one of Satoru’s students, she teams up with Yuji and Megumi for various missions. Self-confident and quick to speak her mind, she takes pride in her own identity, abilities and appearance. Nobara’s distinctive battle style includes the use of hammers and nails infused with cursed energy.  She is voiced by Asami Seto (Japanese) and Anne Yatco (English).Maki Zen'in (禪院真希, Zen'in Maki)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the event with their sister school in Kyoto. Despite being born to a clan of elite Jujutsu Sorcerers, Maki doesn't have the ability to control cursed energy or even see curses. However, she compensates for this with amazing physical strength and talent with all sorts of cursed tools. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu (Japanese) and Allegra Clark (English).Toge Inumaki (狗巻棘, Inumaki Toge)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event. His power is channeled through cursed speech – words imbued with his cursed energy. To ensure that his abilities don't affect people in everyday situations, he only uses words that can be fillings for rice balls. He is voiced by Koki Uchiyama (Japanese) and Xander Mobus (English).Panda (パンダ, Panda)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event with Maki and Toge. Despite his appearance as a full-sized panda, he can speak like a human and is also an exceptionally powerful sorcerer. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki (Japanese) and Matthew David Rudd (English). – Jujutsu High facultySatoru Gojo (五条悟, Gojō Satoru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful sorcerer and teacher who mentors Yuji, Megumi and Nobara. After Yuji is sentenced to death for being possessed by Sukuna, Satoru proposes that they wait until all of the fingers are consumed, which would give them the chance to destroy Sukuna once and for all. He is renowned for his immense power and battle prowess to the point that his self-proclamation of being the world’s strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer goes unchallenged. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese) and Kaiji Tang (English).Masamichi Yaga (夜蛾正道, Yaga Masamichi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteJujutsu High's principal and a passionate educator who once mentored Gojo. He has the ability to bring dolls to life and control them through his cursed corpse technique. He is voiced by Takaya Kuroda (Japanese) and Keith Silverstein (English). – AntagonistsRyomen Sukuna (両面宿儺, Ryōmen Sukuna)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA legendary curse inhabiting Yuji’s body. Also translated as ""Double Faced Specter."" Known as the ""King of Curses"", Sukuna resisted all exorcism attempts, driving sorcerers of centuries ago to cut off and hide his 20 fingers in order to seal his power. His character has roots in Japanese legend, with references to a two-faced, 8-armed and 8-legged man with supernatural strength in Nihon Shoki, the second oldest book of Japanese history. He is voiced by Junichi Suwabe (Japanese), and Ray Chase (English).Suguru Geto (夏油 傑, Getō Suguru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer who wishes to transform the world into a ""paradise"" that would house sorcerers only. He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai (Japanese) and Lex Lang (English).Jogo (漏瑚, Jōgo)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the earth. He believes that his own kind is humanity's true form because cursed spirits originate from pure emotion, as opposed to humans and their false emotions. He is voiced by Shigeru Chiba (Japanese) and Michael Sorich (English).Hanami (花御, Hanami)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the forests. They wish to eliminate humans so they stop hurting the environment. They are voiced by Atsuko Tanaka. Keywords – Curses (呪い, noroi) / Cursed Spirits (呪霊, jurei) Spiritual beings given form by cursed energy (see below). Particularly likely to manifest in places like hospitals and schools, they are the cause of countless mysterious deaths and disappearances in general society, with regular people unable to see them. However, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see, fight and exorcise them. Curses vary greatly in appearance and power, and are ranked by strength with Grades 1-4 (4 being the weakest) and Special Grade (the very strongest). They may also be sealed in artifacts as Sukuna was, becoming cursed objects (呪物, jubutsu) that can still emit cursed energy.  – Cursed Energy (呪力, juryoku)A form of energy that arises from humans’ negative emotions, like hate, regret, and shame, and gives form to curses. While regular people are unable to control it, Jujutsu Sorcerers (see below) and curses are able to harness their own cursed energy for combat.  – Jujutsu Sorcerer (呪術師, jujutsu-shi)Individuals who have been trained to combat curses using Jujutsu spells and techniques at one of Japan’s two recognized Jujutsu educational institutions. They are tasked with various missions, the difficulty of which should match their grade as a sorcerer, with Grade 4 being the lowest and Special Grade being the highest.

It can also be translated as Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical School and abbreviated as Jujutsu High. One of Japan’s only two Jujutsu schools, it is located in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the other (its sister school) located in Kyoto. However, it is disguised as a religious school and is further hidden and protected from outside threats by a protective barrier. It is common for fully-fledged sorcerers to come back to Jujutsu High to teach students, as well as manage and support missions.

Of course he’s nowhere near normal – he’s the hero of  Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, Jujutsu Kaisen), a dark fantasy manga by Gege Akutami (芥見下々, Akutami Gege) with a 24-episode anime series by MAPPA. Set in a world where sorcerers must fight deadly curses born of negative emotions,  Jujutsu Kaisen combines its dark premise with a refreshing modern setting, relatable characters and of course, plenty of action. Read on to learn more about the world of  Jujutsu Kaisen, along with its characters, keywords and more! Contents1. Story2. Setting3. Characters- 3.1 Jujutsu High students- 3.2 Jujutsu High faculty- 3.3 Antagonists4. Keywords5. Main media- 5.1 Manga- 5.2 TV anime series- 5.3 Anime film StoryDespite being blessed with extraordinary athleticism, fifteen-year-old Yuji Itadori refuses to have anything to do with his high school’s track team. His choice? The Occult Research Club. However, his world is thrown into chaos when a cursed talisman in the form of a rotting finger is unsealed at school. To protect his friends, Yuji swallows the finger, which is actually a fragment of legendary ""King of Curses"" Ryomen Sukuna, and becomes possessed himself. Although this effectively signs his death warrant, the intervention of powerful sorcerer Satoru Gojo sets him on a different path: to consume the rest of Sukuna’s fingers so he can destroy the curse – and himself – forever.  SettingTo be human is to experience not only positive feelings, but also negative emotions like sadness, regret and shame. In  Jujutsu Kaisen, such emotions produce cursed energy, which transforms into curses that can bring misfortune to the world. While normal humans cannot control this, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to harness their own cursed energy to use certain techniques. With their supernatural powers, these sorcerers secretly protect humans from curses and the threats they pose to society. Characters – Jujutsu High studentsYuji Itadori (虎杖 悠仁, Itadori Yūji)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA fifteen-year-old with extraordinary athleticism. Good-natured and always willing to help those around him, Yuji particularly values the importance of life and having a “fair death”, which was instilled in him by his dead grandfather. As a result, he eats Sukuna’s finger to save his friends and thus becomes the present-day vessel of the “King of Curses.” He then enrolls in Jujutsu High to become a sorcerer himself under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Through lessons and missions, he learns more about cursed energy and how to control it, boosting his already impressive physical abilities. He is voiced by Junya Enoki (Japanese) and Adam McArthur (English). Megumi Fushiguro (伏黒恵, Fushiguro Megumi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student. Megumi’s search for a cursed object leads him to meet Yuji and witness his self-sacrifice first-hand, despite them being strangers. Secretive and calculating, he nevertheless believes in helping those who are good and kind, as seen when he vouches for Yuji in the face of the latter’s impending execution. The two are later reunited as fellow students under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo. Megumi’s sorcery talents include summoning Shikigami (spirits) for offense and exorcisms. He is voiced by Yuma Uchida (Japanese) and Robbie Daymond (English).Nobara Kugisaki (釘崎野薔薇, Kugisaki Nobara)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA first-year student hailing from the country. As one of Satoru’s students, she teams up with Yuji and Megumi for various missions. Self-confident and quick to speak her mind, she takes pride in her own identity, abilities and appearance. Nobara’s distinctive battle style includes the use of hammers and nails infused with cursed energy.  She is voiced by Asami Seto (Japanese) and Anne Yatco (English).Maki Zen'in (禪院真希, Zen'in Maki)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the event with their sister school in Kyoto. Despite being born to a clan of elite Jujutsu Sorcerers, Maki doesn't have the ability to control cursed energy or even see curses. However, she compensates for this with amazing physical strength and talent with all sorts of cursed tools. She is voiced by Mikako Komatsu (Japanese) and Allegra Clark (English).Toge Inumaki (狗巻棘, Inumaki Toge)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event. His power is channeled through cursed speech – words imbued with his cursed energy. To ensure that his abilities don't affect people in everyday situations, he only uses words that can be fillings for rice balls. He is voiced by Koki Uchiyama (Japanese) and Xander Mobus (English).Panda (パンダ, Panda)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA second-year student who participates in the sister school event with Maki and Toge. Despite his appearance as a full-sized panda, he can speak like a human and is also an exceptionally powerful sorcerer. He is voiced by Tomokazu Seki (Japanese) and Matthew David Rudd (English). – Jujutsu High facultySatoru Gojo (五条悟, Gojō Satoru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful sorcerer and teacher who mentors Yuji, Megumi and Nobara. After Yuji is sentenced to death for being possessed by Sukuna, Satoru proposes that they wait until all of the fingers are consumed, which would give them the chance to destroy Sukuna once and for all. He is renowned for his immense power and battle prowess to the point that his self-proclamation of being the world’s strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer goes unchallenged. He is voiced by Yuichi Nakamura (Japanese) and Kaiji Tang (English).Masamichi Yaga (夜蛾正道, Yaga Masamichi)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteJujutsu High's principal and a passionate educator who once mentored Gojo. He has the ability to bring dolls to life and control them through his cursed corpse technique. He is voiced by Takaya Kuroda (Japanese) and Keith Silverstein (English). – AntagonistsRyomen Sukuna (両面宿儺, Ryōmen Sukuna)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA legendary curse inhabiting Yuji’s body. Also translated as ""Double Faced Specter."" Known as the ""King of Curses"", Sukuna resisted all exorcism attempts, driving sorcerers of centuries ago to cut off and hide his 20 fingers in order to seal his power. His character has roots in Japanese legend, with references to a two-faced, 8-armed and 8-legged man with supernatural strength in Nihon Shoki, the second oldest book of Japanese history. He is voiced by Junichi Suwabe (Japanese), and Ray Chase (English).Suguru Geto (夏油 傑, Getō Suguru)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA Special Grade Jujutsu Sorcerer who wishes to transform the world into a ""paradise"" that would house sorcerers only. He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai (Japanese) and Lex Lang (English).Jogo (漏瑚, Jōgo)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the earth. He believes that his own kind is humanity's true form because cursed spirits originate from pure emotion, as opposed to humans and their false emotions. He is voiced by Shigeru Chiba (Japanese) and Michael Sorich (English).Hanami (花御, Hanami)Source: Jujutsu Kaisen official websiteA powerful curse born of fear of the forests. They wish to eliminate humans so they stop hurting the environment. They are voiced by Atsuko Tanaka. Keywords – Curses (呪い, noroi) / Cursed Spirits (呪霊, jurei) Spiritual beings given form by cursed energy (see below). Particularly likely to manifest in places like hospitals and schools, they are the cause of countless mysterious deaths and disappearances in general society, with regular people unable to see them. However, Jujutsu Sorcerers are able to see, fight and exorcise them. Curses vary greatly in appearance and power, and are ranked by strength with Grades 1-4 (4 being the weakest) and Special Grade (the very strongest). They may also be sealed in artifacts as Sukuna was, becoming cursed objects (呪物, jubutsu) that can still emit cursed energy.  – Cursed Energy (呪力, juryoku)A form of energy that arises from humans’ negative emotions, like hate, regret, and shame, and gives form to curses. While regular people are unable to control it, Jujutsu Sorcerers (see below) and curses are able to harness their own cursed energy for combat.  – Jujutsu Sorcerer (呪術師, jujutsu-shi)Individuals who have been trained to combat curses using Jujutsu spells and techniques at one of Japan’s two recognized Jujutsu educational institutions. They are tasked with various missions, the difficulty of which should match their grade as a sorcerer, with Grade 4 being the lowest and Special Grade being the highest. These duties may involve exorcising curses, investigating curse-related incidents, and so on.  – Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School (東京都立呪術高等専門学校, Tōkyo Toritsu Jujutsu Senmon Gakkō)A 4-year institution where aspiring Jujutsu Sorcerers gather to train their craft. It can also be translated as Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical School and abbreviated as Jujutsu High. One of Japan’s only two Jujutsu schools, it is located in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the other (its sister school) located in Kyoto. However, it is disguised as a religious school and is further hidden and protected from outside threats by a protective barrier. It is common for fully-fledged sorcerers to come back to Jujutsu High to teach students, as well as manage and support missions.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: “Keep your heart burning!” (And don’t forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: “Keep your heart burning!” (And don’t forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1.

Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2.

A warning will be displayed before any spoilers are mentioned, so rest assured that you can read this article even if you haven’t watched it yet!Fantasy anime  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba has taken not only Japan, but the entire world by storm. On October 16, 2020, a sequel,  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train, was released in Japan. In just 10 days, it earned over 100 billion yen in box office revenues, the fastest movie to have ever done so in Japan, and the two month mark saw it go past a whopping 300 million yen. If that wasn't enough, it even overtook  Studio Ghibli's  Spirited Away, previously the highest-grossing film in Japanese history - yet another record set at blazing speeds!Along with this wave of popularity, manga volumes and general  KnY merchandise has been selling out everywhere. Regardless of age and gender, the franchise has truly attracted passionate fans far and wide.Penned by a TOM Staff member and true  KnY fan who’s gone to see  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train an unbelievable 16 times, this article will introduce nine of its highlights - in other words, nine reasons to go and watch it when it's available where you are. Get ready to engage in some Total Concentration Reading!First, let’s talk about the background behind  Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Movie: Mugen Train. The original manga,  Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, tells the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who embarks on a quest to heal his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon. During this journey, he and his companions must face intense battles against evil demons.  Mugen Train covers the 7th and 8th volumes of the manga. In terms of the TV anime series, the movie follows on from the story of the 26th and last episode, “New Mission.” If you haven’t seen the TV anime yet, I recommend watching it first. For some quick information on the plot, setting, and key vocab, check out our guide to Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba!Now, watch closely… and pay attention to these highlights! 1. Unbelievably Beautiful VisualsWhen it first came out, the TV anime's stunning animation and breathtaking battle scenes went viral. Of course, these high standards were maintained in the movie as well. Seeing those amazing battle scenes on the big screen was particularly overwhelming! The sheer speed made me feel like I was running through the screen with Tanjiro and the others, while the ominous figures of their enemies, the demons, had me shivering… From the first scene of the advancing Mugen Train to the credits, you can dive right into the world of  KnY through the spectacular animation. And it’s not just the battle scenes – charming country landscapes, the train’s striking interior, snowy mountains, the Rengoku family’s traditional Japanese house… There’s just so much to enjoy in this amazing movie, produced by ufotable, a studio whose animation of katana and Japanese architechture has been well received in anime like  Touken Ranbu and much more. Be sure to look out for the backgrounds, too! Here’s a tip: each of the fusuma, or sliding doors, have especially elaborate designs.  2. The Flame Hashira: The One and Only Kyojuro RengokuOne thing I want – or actually, need you to pay attention to is the second protagonist of Mugen Train: Kyojuro Rengoku, the Demon Slayer Corps’ Flame Hashira. Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character. At the beginning of Episode 24 of the anime series, Kyojuro is seen talking with Shinobu Kocho (the Insect Hashira) about his upcoming mission on the Mugen Train. He didn’t receive any battle scenes during the series, so the movie is the first time we actually get to see him and his Flame Breathing techniques in action. The flames that roar through the train, his unbelievably swift reactions, the movement of his cape, his intense red eyes that seem to see through all…Everything. Is. Way. Too. Cool.Seriously, everything about him is just so cool… How am I meant to deal with this… (I mean, I don’t have to.) The moment he began his Flame Breathing First Form: Shiranui, I realized, “Oh, I’ve pretty much spent nothing on this movie… This is already worth the ticket…”From his sword techniques to his mere presence and words, every part of Rengoku Kyojuro is priceless. Honestly, this movie leaves you no time to even blink. Everything is something to look out for. I don’t want you to let even a tenth of a second escape your attention, so be sure to use plenty of eye drops before it starts 3. The Mugen Train and its Real-Life OriginsLet’s take a look at a certain train otaku favorite in Japan, SL Hitoyoshi, which features an 8620 Class steam locomotive. Commonly known as “hachiroku"" (meaning ""86”), it’s none other than the locomotive that inspired the appearance of the Mugen Train! From the beginning of the movie, we get plenty of glimpses at Japan in the Taisho Era (1912-1926), from the design of the station and passenger cars to the fashion of the passengers themselves. Through the animation, we also experience its sheer speed, as well as the actual sensation of being swayed as we ride in the heavy carriages. It’s downright awesome!Here in Japan, we actually got to see a collaboration between SL Hitoyoshi and  KnY, where the locomotive was transformed into a real-life Mugen Train for a limited run. Naturally, it was so popular that it was practically impossible to get your hands on tickets. (Yup, I didn’t manage to snag any either…) It quickly became a viral topic on social media, with people excited to see a “real-life Mugen Train” even in photos and videos.  4. Tanjiro’s Feelings For His FamilyKnY’s story begins with a powerful theme: family. We also see its importance in the movie, which beautifully illustrates Tanjiro’s feelings for his family. He’s already lost so many people important to him, but no matter how much he wants to return to those happy days, there’s no going back – he'll never be able to see his loved ones again. This movie’s depiction of Tanjiro’s family, entangled in memories both happy and sad, but never to be restored, will have your eyes streaming with tears. 5. And Of Course, the Funny Scenes!Another great element that we get to see again are the hilarious moments between Inosuke and Zenitsu! You’ll also find yourself chuckling at Rengoku as he scarfs down his ekiben (bento lunches bought at train stations). Another heads up – at first Zenitsu’s dream sequence will probably just seem funny, but if you pay attention to where it’s set, that smile might turn into tears… (This is especially aimed at anyone who’s already read the manga up to the Mugen Train arc – I want you to think long and hard about where he is in that dream!) Spoiler Alert!From here, I’ll be introducing specific details about the movie, so please stop reading if you want to avoid spoilers.↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓Alright! Let’s keep going with more highlights, including actual scenes from the movie! 6. An Unprecedented Battle of IntellectTanjiro’s new foe, and the demon controlling the Mugen Train is Enmu, Lower Rank One in the Twelve Kizuki. Before the events of the movie, Muzan himself took a liking to Enmu and gifted him with Muzan’s blood. Having gained power with this infusion, Enmu decides to enlist the help of humans – or rather, use them as a means for his plan. Thus, the lives of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, Nezuko, and their mission companion, Rengoku, as well as the train’s many regular passengers, are Enmu’s next targets. His gentle and calm manner of speaking and friendly smile prove to make him an even more sinister character. Carrying out his plan with meticulous care, Enmu attempts to put Tanjiro and the other humans to sleep forever through his Blood Demon Art, a style of attack that they’ve never faced before. How will Tanjiro and his fellow Demon Slayers wake themselves up from Enmu’s eternal dreams? 7. The Sudden Appearance of Upper Rank Three, AkazaThe last part of the movie takes a huge turn with the sudden appearance of Akaza (Upper Rank Three) and his fierce battle against Rengoku. Just before dawn, Tanjiro and the others finally get the chance to breathe a sigh of relief, having defeated Enmu and checked that the passengers are safe. But this only lasts for a moment, with the Demon Slayers gathered facing the dreaded Upper Rank Three for the first time. The sudden roaring sound signals the appearance of something... but then dies down, leaving an eerie silence. Then, a pair of eyes glisten in the darkness. This frightening sense of anticipation crosses the screen to weigh down on you, causing you to instinctively clench your fists in suspense…Despite Akaza being a favorite among  KnY’s many demons, we didn’t get any information on his voice actor, or even still images until the movie’s official release. As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans. If you’re watching the movie with Japanese audio, be sure to soak up every moment of Akaza’s malevolence, madness and despair through Ishida’s formidable voice acting!One more highlight is the overwhelming energy of Rengoku and Akaza in their battle scenes, yet another part where you can’t afford to blink. If IMAX screenings are available near you, take advantage of them and experience the fight’s sheer power at full volume. It goes without saying that you can still experience plenty at normal theaters, but I urge you to go and feel the huge impact behind each and every hit at IMAX volume levels! The depiction of the snowflake patterns in Akaza’s Technique Deployment ability is also a highlight. In the original manga’s 18th volume, we learn about Akaza’s past. Despite being a ruthless demon with numerous victims, the sorrows of his life as a human capture the pity of readers. Personally, he’s one of my favorite characters. After watching the movie, I also recommend going right to the rest of the manga to continue the story! 8. Tears of FrustrationAt the end of the battle, Tanjiro and his companions are overwhelmed by the realization that they are still too weak, no matter how much work they put in or how hard they train. Sneering down with their seemingly infinite power are the demons. Haunted by the thought that they couldn’t do anything, that they had to be protected by others, the young humans have faced frustration, sadness, and uncontrollable tears. For the sake of their slain family members and beloved people they still had to protect, they’ve trained over and over, fought to survive the Final Selection, narrowly escaped death every night, and made huge progress. Yet their power was still nowhere near enough. And now, the man they had followed has fallen victim to their enemies. No matter how many times you watch the movie, this realization will tear your heart to shreds. In the face of such a tragedy, Inosuke offers some words that are deeply touching. His upbringing among wild boars may have given him less experience with other people, but we can see that he’s grown yet again as a human.  9. Rengoku’s Explosive Battle Through LifeFans who have already read the manga will know what I’m talking about. In any case, I won’t elaborate too much, but I urge you to burn his battles and his way of life into your mind – why he risks his life in battle, why he tries to protect humans. His crystal-clear beliefs and promises will also give you an insight into the loneliness he must bear. Protect the weak. Respect one’s duty and values. In what light will you see these warriors and hear their words as they fight to protect others? If you have the chance, please find out on the big screen. Finally, let me leave you with these words: “Keep your heart burning!” (And don’t forget a handkerchief!)This is a Tokyo Otaku Mode original article with text and illustrations by HER.--Need some more quality time with the KnY crew?

Many people may have been surprised at Kyojuro’s first appearance in the anime series – the moment he lays eyes upon Nezuko, already a demon, and Tanjiro, who brought her, he orders that she be decapitated. This paints him as quite an unreasonable person who won’t even stop for an explanation first, but we go on to learn so much more about him. A son of the Rengoku family and its historic Fire Hashira lineage, we see his gentle soul, strength, and unwavering heart and convictions, as well as the loneliness that follows a man of his nature. All of this is sure to draw you to him as a character.

As a result, fans speculated that the movie might only cover Enmu’s arc and stop before showing Akaza, or that the anime series would continue with his story. However, the movie’s premiere date came and the cat was finally let out of the bag. We now know that Akaza’s voice actor is Akira Ishida, famous for roles like Kaworu Nagisa in  Neon Genesis Evangelion! This casting was a huge yet welcome surprise for fans.

It's been a few days since we've said hello to 2022, but we don't want to forget the great anime news we heard in 2021 just yet! That's why we put together a selection of TOM News articles that our readers loved. 2021 was a busy year, so perhaps some will be new to you - on the other hand, if you've already seen all of them, thank you for being such a great reader!First, we have five articles on huge announcements for manga, anime, and more. After that, you'll find five of our original articles, with some appearances from our very own TOM Senpais. Simply click on each title or thumbnail to check them out! TOM News ☆ Bleach One-Shot Manga Debuts With Epic Cliffhanger!20 years after  Bleach burst onto the scene, it blew our minds again with a one-shot titled New Breathes From Hell! We won't spoil the ending for you if you haven't read it, but it's well worth a look. We're still pondering over the huge questions it poses for the future of Ichigo and his friends... ☆ The Saga of Tanya the Evil Season 2 Confirmed!We may not have any more details on Season 2 yet, but TOM News readers were clearly as pumped as we were to hear that Tanya will be back! Hopefully, we'll be hearing more soon. ☆ Hell's Paradise: Jigokuraku Gets TV Anime Adaptation!Yuji Kaku's manga ended this January after a three-year run, but at least we won't be saying goodbye completely! Not to mention, the series will be animated by MAPPA, the studio behind hit series like  Jujutsu Kaisen and  Dorohedoro, not to mention the final season of  Attack on Titan. Have you seen the trailer yet? ☆ Hatsune Miku to Get ""Mikuverse"" With Animated Series and More!Just when we thought Miku couldn't get any bigger, she surprised us yet again with an upcoming ""Mikuverse!"" Be sure to check out what's to come if you haven't already. ☆ Spirited Away Stage Adaptation Confirms Main Cast!Stage plays are a huge industry in Japan, but we never expected this beloved Ghibli film would be the next one! It'll premiere early next year, so we're pumped to find out what  Spirited Away will look like in a new medium. TOM Original Articles ☆ WonHobby 33 Photo ReportWe definitely haven't been taking anime and figure-related events for granted this year, so we were thrilled to give you a peek at Good Smile Company and Max Factory's WonHobby 33. Looking back now, you might recognize a few prototypes that have since been released as gorgeous new figures... ☆ I Saw Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Train 16 Times - Here Are 9 Reasons You Have to See It!Well, the title says it all! This article was created with the love and devotion of our resident KNY expert, so even if you aren't a fan of the series, this might just convince you. ☆ Hatsune Miku Chronicle Event ReportMiku is such a huge presence that it's easy to forget she officially came into the world only 14 years ago. If you want to look back with us, check out the event, which chronicles her impressive background! ☆ Beginner's Guide to Jujutsu Kaisen!Okay, you can be honest - raise your hand if you haven't read/watched  Jujutsu Kaisen yet. Maybe you've been occupied with other things or just don't feel like starting a new series, but if you have a spare moment, feel free to take our crash course! ☆ How to Photograph Figures: Teach Me, TOM Senpai!One of our TOM Senpais, who happens to be a wizard at photography, created this awesome guide in the lead-up to our 3rd Figure Photo Contest, but it definitely applies all year round!Thanks for making it to the end!

26-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"Tokyo Otaku ModeShopNewsGalleryOtapediaLog InSign UpAbout UsOur PromiseLetter From the FounderTokyo Otaku Mode FAQTOM Shop FAQTOM Premium FAQContact UsAdvertiseOur Business PartnersIcon and BannerAffiliate ProgramEnglishJapaneseLetter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold?

I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

26-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"About UsOur PromiseLetter From the FounderTokyo Otaku Mode FAQTOM Shop FAQTOM Premium FAQContact UsAdvertiseOur Business PartnersIcon and BannerAffiliate ProgramEnglishJapaneseLetter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors.

If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

26-04-2022,anime,11,0,https://otakumode.com/letter,Letter from the Founder | Tokyo Otaku Mode (TOM),"EnglishJapaneseLetter from the FounderMy name is Tomo Kamei, the Founder of Tokyo Otaku Mode. Since I am not sure which country those of you who are reading this may be in, let me greet you by saying good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.I created this page to provide you with a better understanding of what exactly Tokyo Otaku Mode is and also to convey the ambitions and intentions we as a team have for Tokyo Otaku Mode and how we plan to expand our service. I would like to directly convey to you in my own words when and why we started Tokyo Otaku Mode, the reason for expanding our service overseas, and our goal for the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The Bud that Sprouted Before the Creation of Tokyo Otaku ModeHave you ever seen a 40.1 meter tsunami?On March 10, 2011, I was working at an advertising company and on a business trip in Fukushima Prefecture. Tohoku is an area in the northern part of Japan. On that day, I had finished my work faster than I had thought I would. I boarded the bullet train, gazed out at the Tohoku scenery through the window, and took a small nap. The next day, I attended a business meeting at the office. Everything was normal.Then, the earthquake hit.Everything was flying off the shelves, and the shaking was so strong, it sounded like a scream. The ground was soft and flexible like a trampoline mat. I tried to keep calm, but it felt like the soles of my feet were on fire, and I was scared. After the shaking had stopped, we turned on the TV and the announcer was giving a warning: “A large 8.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Tohoku has struck. Everyone in the area should evacuate immediately.” Many people either lost their lives or went missing due to the earthquake and the resulting tsunami. Cities were swallowed by the waves of the tsunami that rose up high in the sky. One such city was the one I had been in the day before. The white shirts of the clients I met on the business trip, the smiles on the men’s faces who worked at the hotel, the red tiled roofs bleached by the sea breeze, the sound of the tires on the taxi I rode to the station squeaking to a stop. Even now, fragments of such memories from the city come to mind. And most of these were dragged away from reality by the earthquake and tsunami. My right index finger shook uncontrollably as I watched the TV.At that time, there was something else I was striving for other than work. That was starting up Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page. Basically, the idea was to transmit to the world representative otaku content like anime and manga. I ironed out the concept of Tokyo Otaku Mode with my colleagues, and, with the desire to somehow convey the current trends in Japanese content by utilizing our advantage of being in Japan, we thought up the idea that otaku content would be great as content delivered through Facebook to overseas countries. So, we came up with the plan to launch a Facebook page at the end of March, and we steadily started preparing. But then the earthquake happened and we thought about postponing the launch.In the days following, tragic news concerning the earthquake was reported on TV and in newspapers throughout Japan. I also saw despairing comments regarding Japan even in overseas news reports. Even online, blatantly inaccurate information like “So-and-so manga artist died in the earthquake” was running rampant. What was really going on in Japan was not being properly conveyed.I talked with my colleagues once more. We wondered if there was something we could do, something we should do. We ultimately decided to launch the Facebook page we had been thinking about due to what was going on at the time. We wanted to be the first to convey to people all over the world the same enjoyment we had experienced from anime and manga up until then.Even today, I remember the sprouting of a powerful determination along with those feelings that matched our mission. Thus, two weeks after the earthquake, on March 24, I, along with my colleagues, launched Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Facebook page.Tokyo Otaku Mode: From Street Presentations to Silicon ValleyTokyo Otaku Mode was primarily started by several members, myself included. Even today, all of us are active in the company as founding members.At first, we started by introducing content related to the subcultures of Japan on Facebook. Looking back on it, it was a meager attempt, like something someone would make out of hobby. We went through a harsh time at the beginning where we weren’t getting any fans. Even still, we proceeded in trial and error and continued to persevere and update the page with information on Japan’s subcultures and pictures of cosplayers we would take by attending otaku-related events. By doing so, our number of fans slowly increased up to us having several million. Our continuing conviction of having this service be for the benefit of people all over the world had paid off.However, even though our number of fans continued to increase, I was still employed elsewhere, as were the other members. Even at the time when Tokyo Otaku Mode had several million fans, we were still treating it like a recreational activity, doing it between working and on our days off. At that time, I had a certain encounter that would change that. In the winter of 2012 (February), I had the chance to meet with Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups, a small-investment fund that actively invests in businesses that are just starting out, which came about by us giving a street presentation in Shibuya. We desperately explained Tokyo Otaku Mode, and after listening to our presentation, Dave recommended us to come to Silicon Valley. In other words, he was going to invest in us.I immediately quit the company I was working for and made the jump to America. And just like that, my colleagues came along and on April 10, 2012, more than 10,000 kilometers from Tohoku in Silicon Valley, Tokyo Otaku Mode officially became a company. Three-hundred and ninety six days had passed since the day when I first saw on TV the devastation of the earthquake.Becoming a Service and Place for News to Satisfy Both Fans and CreatorsBefore Tokyo Otaku Mode became a corporate body (around 2010), thinking that I should understand overseas market economies, I used my own money to go to Shanghai, Vietnam, Philippines, and San Francisco to observe companies. In other words, I was able to see many things. As a part of these trips, I would do things like check to see what Japanese content and services were popular and listen to what the natives of the area had to say. Among all this, there was one thing that struck me, that being the circulation of pirated anime and manga. It differed by the areas in each country, but there was the same level of proliferation of pirated content, the source to which was unknown. People were buying these copies even though they knew they weren’t authentic… In subtle ways, well-known anime and manga were being altered and sold. I had heard of the existence of pirated copies before, but I was astonished by the reality that works having been stripped of their original rights and values were being offered by people overseas.A pirated copy of a work is an illegal replication. There are pirated software and anime that ignore the rights of the works’ creators that are sold and distributed online. Because most Japanese anime and manga is created in Japanese, translating them to other languages to circulate them overseas is unavoidable. Therefore, do translated pirated versions really convey the creator’s intent? Among manga that have 10 volumes, there may be a volume that becomes hard to find anywhere. Because fans in this instance won’t be able to keep up with the work’s story, they may feel disappointed and think “This isn’t fun,” and this may be the basis for fans losing interest in anime and manga. By observing things overseas, it has strengthened my complicated feelings toward pirated copies. I think that those reading this have a love of Japanese anime and manga and a desire to enjoy what is to come. If that’s the case, I hope that you would show your understanding of the fact that by giving creators the value they rightfully deserve, you are helping them to continue creating.There are fans who want to happen upon new works and creators who want to create even better works. By viewing things overseas, the question “If content could be supplied in a more legitimate way, would that make people happy?” came to mind. Tokyo Otaku Mode is our answer to that question. We are trying to create a worldwide platform that meets the needs of both fans and creators, a place that is unburdened by economic conditions and social issues of any single country or area, a place that anime and manga fans the world over can enjoy.Thus, through our service, we want to increase the earnings of anime with a production cost of $1 million to $2 or $3 million (By the way, there is a lot of deep otaku content in Japan. It is Tokyo Otaku Mode’s mission to also introduce this with everyone.). We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works.

We want the works we introduce to be known throughout the world, and even for related products to steadily sell well; to timely offer information on products and works, regardless of country or area; and to return to a place where creators and manufacturers gain profits for their works. If we are able to do that, I believe that we can create a positive influence on all those related to producing works and that they will continue to create high-quality entertainment.The People of Tokyo Otaku ModeThe people who manage the Tokyo Otaku Mode service were brought together mainly through the founding members’ personal connections.This includes not just the programmers who can be called the lifeline of managing the website, but also members who support the creators, members who manage the shop, cameramen, and editors. In other words, the site was established through assembling people from all kinds of fields in order to spread otaku content to people all over the world and to create an environment that creators can immerse themselves in.By the way, we use the catch-all term “creator” to refer to anyone who produces creative work and has the skills to make people enjoy it, whether they are illustrators, cosplayers, Vocaloid producers, manga artists, or something else. I want creators to thoroughly immerse themselves in creating their works. Occasionally, they slip into the world of a work that seems like it’s at the bottom of the ocean. They are so focused that they can’t hear anything around them, and they create worlds that no one has seen in form that everyone can see. Giving a work such form takes extraordinary ability and time.However, even though many young creators possess skill, they lack money. It’s difficult to eke out a living on just independent creations without cooperating with manufacturers and companies and establishing a sales route. To make ends meet, many must get second jobs. In other words, they have no choice but to scale back how much time they can devote to creating works. Even though they want to create work, reality won’t allow them to. Many creators have been burdened by this dilemma throughout history, even though they possess talent that would most likely bloom if only they had time to devote to it.That is why we lend our support to these creators. Basically, we do this by offering them a platform on which to show their works, help them to communicate with fans all over the world by translating their messages, and try to return the profits and rights to those who can’t spread their works to the world. We are doing a lot to collaborate with them, which also involves producing posters, T-shirts, and other original products of their works.Through their products, the creators can make a profit. Thus, they are able to devote more time to immersing themselves in their creations, which I believe heightens the possibility of them creating even better works. I want the wonderful works crafted by creators of such skill to be more highly known by everyone all over the world.Well, doesn’t that make you excited? What kind of new works will be created and what will the future hold? I want to happen upon a work and think “I’m so glad I found this work,” and then to spread this joy by sharing the work with everyone around the world.This is how all of us at Tokyo Otaku Mode feel.Tokyo Otaku Mode’s Mission: To Change the World’s Course By a Single MillimeterThe Earth’s diameter is 12,742 kilometers. Though the Himalayas and Africa’s Great Rift Valley are a different story. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode want to create a 1 millimeter shift in the world of someone born somewhere on this vast Earth. This may be something that many people also think. Art, services, religion, love––it’s true that people and companies try to convey various thoughts to others. We understand that for those captivated by subcultures like anime and manga, enjoying such works and products brings about feelings of peace. It’s difficult for humans to feel depressed when they are enjoying something. It’s also difficult to feel sad or cry when you are happy and smiling. It is for that reason that the attitude of otaku who enjoy things from deep within their being may be the foundation for creating more peace throughout the world. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode believe in this possibility, and we want to steer the world in a better direction through elevating the level of familiarity and values of otaku culture.Our mission on a more concrete level is to deliver to the world Japanese otaku content. To say it a different way, we want to promote all otaku values and create a place and opportunities for each individual to be able to reflect upon the joy of being otaku. Another mission of ours is to discover and support talented creators in order to construct an ecosystem of creations being continuously realized. I may be speaking too grandiose, but we aim to create a new art culture that will in turn elevate the status of otaku culture.We merely propagate a variety of things to people around the world; the value of that is up to them. It is not our intention to arbitrarily push our own values. The world will be changed by the otaku that populate it; we are just laying the groundwork.Tokyo Otaku Mode ShopFinally, I’d like to talk about the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop.The thought of starting the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was born through our mission and our own personal experiences. An environment where people, things, and products that should be valued will surely be valued; a place to make both fans and creators happy. As an extension of these thoughts, the idea of establishing a shop service––through which we could not only deliver to fans all over the world authentic products from Japan, but also deliver to fans’ hands creators’ works in the form of products on top of transmitting information and sharings creators’ works––began to blossom.Everything we sell on the Tokyo Otaku Mode Shop was procured through legitimate means. We received permission to sell each and every item, which we offer to everyone living overseas.This has always stayed constant, whether it’s an introduction to a creator’s work on the Gallery page, or distributing otaku news on the News page. What we do on the Shop page is the same as our overall mission: to deliver Japanese otaku content to everyone around the world. The Shop page is just a more tangible representation of this mission; it can be held, touched, and seen adorning nearby walls as canvas boards and posters. It’s a way to distinctly feel those merits. That is one of our desires for our shop service. We’d be happy if our shop is stocked with things that you enjoy.If there is something you can’t find, please send us an inquiry. We understand that for every 100 otaku, there will be 100 different things that they enjoy. Therefore, we’d like to hear requests from everyone around the world as to what kind of products they would like. I don’t know if we will be able to fulfill 100% of those requests, but we will do the best that we can.We want everyone around the world to look forward to receiving products they desire and relish the moment of finally getting those products and being so happy that their heart skips a beat. That is one of the highlights of being otaku. Artwork, check. News, check. Products, check. We at Tokyo Otaku Mode will continue day after day to offer fascinating otaku content for everyone in every area of the globe to enjoy. And we will proceed in changing the direction of the world.  Yes, even if it’s only a millimeter.Thank you for taking the time to read this. Everyone here at Tokyo Otaku Mode would like to convey their thanks for embracing this place, cooperating with us, and helping us to grow up until now and into the future.",positive,,"{'https://otakumode.com/': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/shop': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/news': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/gallery': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/otapedia': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/login?r=/letter&via=header': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/signup?r=/letter&via=header': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/about': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/promise': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/letter': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/faq': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/hc/shop': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/hc/premium': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/inquire': 2, 'https://otakumode.com/advertise': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/business_partners': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/linksbnr': 1, 'https://otakumode.com/affiliate/intro': 1, 'https://corporate.otakumode.com/': 1, 'http://myanimelist.net/?_location=tom_footer': 1, 'http://blog.honeyfeed.fm/': 1, 'https://animeanime.global/': 1}"

As she’s hunting monsters in the game to let off some steam, a man with an afro from her guild named Yamada calls out to her. She gets caught up in the moment and complains to him about getting dumped, to which he coldly responds “I don’t give a crap.”Later on, in an attempt to get back at her ex, Akane gets all dressed up and marches into a real-life event for the game, where she’s called out once again the exact same way Yamada did… but this time by a handsome young man who saved her. Akane’s love life, which ended in an online game, is about to begin anew in the same game!?        10         【illustration: Nekokurage/Itsuki Nanao】 【illustration: Minoji Kurata】      Kusuriya no hitorigoto Monthly BIG GANGAN SQUARE ENIX Natsu Hyuuga.NekokurageItsuki Nanao  SundayGX Shogakukan Natsu HyuugaMinoji KurataTouko Shino    ©2021 Natsu Hyuuga/Shufunotomo Infos Co.,Ltd©Nekokurage/SQUARE ENIX©Itsuki Nanao/SQUARE ENIX©Natsu Hyuuga, Touko Shino／Shufunotomo Infos Co.,Ltd.©Minoji Kurata／Shogakukan       Summary “It’s the hugely popular title, Hero Bunko’s “Kusuriya no Hitorigoto” from the Shōsetsuka ni Narō website, now in comic form!

Tokyo Anime News,"    The E-Sports Boom Inspires New Japanese Manga  Manga April 15, 09:49   0    #Game #e-sports #GuardianAngel #MangaBANG        If organizations like Cloud9 and Team Liquid are familiar to you, and gamer tags like SonicFox ring a bell, then you’re probably well-versed in the wild world of eSports.eSports, or e-sports, however you want to say it, obviously stands for electronic sports. Just as there’s professional competitive sports like basketball or baseball, it’s possible to be pro-level and compete in PC and video games. The organized gaming phenomenon has taken the entire world by storm over the last decade, with professional eSports teams rising up from just about every country you could think of. These international teams compete with one another to crown the best players in the world. Even traditional sports news networks like ESPN now televise eSports competitions. It would be foolish not to, as eSports is a multi-billion-dollar industry!To give you an idea of the excitement and fast-paced action that makes such a market boom, you can check out the following video. It’s a recent nail-biting match between Team Liquid and KRÜ in the Stage 1 Masters Valorant Champions Tour 2022.As you might expect, to be the top eSports team or eSports player requires intense training, just as traditional sports do. But the regimen is very different from the kind you find in say, soccer or hockey. A lot of eSports achievement focuses on precise and swift hand-eye coordination while using screens, keyboards and controllers. Communication between teammates, often through headsets, is also key. Leagues separated by gender are common in traditional sports, but eSports may be the competitive world that finally breaks away from that kind of division. CNN has recently reported about the Valorant Game Changers initiative, which aims to “provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players.” In a few years, the male-dominated eSports scene might not look the same.Which brings us to the recently released Japanese manga, Guardian Angel. Now available with English translation, Guardian Angel follows a female main character Akane Hinata. Akane transfers to Tomohana High and is quickly invited to join one of the school’s clubs - the General Course eSports Society. A manga about a girls’ eSports team like this has the potential to inspire females to go professional in eSports. Or, as with the Valorant Game Changers program, real life female gamers may inspire more representation of professional eSports females in popular new anime and manga works.    Guardian Angel introduces eSports to the reader by presenting everything through Akane’s eyes. She’s completely new to the world of eSports, so the reader can learn about the phenomenon as she does. But she also proves early on to show great potential for competitive gaming thanks to her amazing hand-eye coordination. You can see this in the first chapter, available on the Manga Flip app for free. Or watch the chapters in video form as they’re gradually released on the Manga Bang YouTube Channel.

Tokyo Anime News,"   The E-Sports Boom Inspires New Japanese Manga  Manga April 15, 09:49   0    #Game #e-sports #GuardianAngel #MangaBANG        If organizations like Cloud9 and Team Liquid are familiar to you, and gamer tags like SonicFox ring a bell, then you’re probably well-versed in the wild world of eSports.eSports, or e-sports, however you want to say it, obviously stands for electronic sports. Just as there’s professional competitive sports like basketball or baseball, it’s possible to be pro-level and compete in PC and video games. The organized gaming phenomenon has taken the entire world by storm over the last decade, with professional eSports teams rising up from just about every country you could think of. These international teams compete with one another to crown the best players in the world. Even traditional sports news networks like ESPN now televise eSports competitions. It would be foolish not to, as eSports is a multi-billion-dollar industry!To give you an idea of the excitement and fast-paced action that makes such a market boom, you can check out the following video. It’s a recent nail-biting match between Team Liquid and KRÜ in the Stage 1 Masters Valorant Champions Tour 2022.As you might expect, to be the top eSports team or eSports player requires intense training, just as traditional sports do. But the regimen is very different from the kind you find in say, soccer or hockey. A lot of eSports achievement focuses on precise and swift hand-eye coordination while using screens, keyboards and controllers. Communication between teammates, often through headsets, is also key. Leagues separated by gender are common in traditional sports, but eSports may be the competitive world that finally breaks away from that kind of division. CNN has recently reported about the Valorant Game Changers initiative, which aims to “provide a platform for marginalized genders to compete and develop into professional players.” In a few years, the male-dominated eSports scene might not look the same.Which brings us to the recently released Japanese manga, Guardian Angel. Now available with English translation, Guardian Angel follows a female main character Akane Hinata. Akane transfers to Tomohana High and is quickly invited to join one of the school’s clubs - the General Course eSports Society. A manga about a girls’ eSports team like this has the potential to inspire females to go professional in eSports. Or, as with the Valorant Game Changers program, real life female gamers may inspire more representation of professional eSports females in popular new anime and manga works.    Guardian Angel introduces eSports to the reader by presenting everything through Akane’s eyes. She’s completely new to the world of eSports, so the reader can learn about the phenomenon as she does. But she also proves early on to show great potential for competitive gaming thanks to her amazing hand-eye coordination. You can see this in the first chapter, available on the Manga Flip app for free. Or watch the chapters in video form as they’re gradually released on the Manga Bang YouTube Channel.

In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Germany to send tanks to Ukraine in U-turnChinese tutors killed in Karachi university attackPublished46 minutes agoElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter usersPublished1 hour agoFeaturesUkrainian border village where rockets litter roadsThe Ukrainian defence unit holding the line in DonbasWhy Australia has compulsory voting.

In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Germany to send tanks to Ukraine in U-turnChinese tutors killed in Karachi university attackPublished46 minutes agoElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter usersPublished1 hour agoFeaturesUkrainian border village where rockets litter roadsThe Ukrainian defence unit holding the line in DonbasWhy Australia has compulsory voting.

26-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49042992,Kyoto Animation fire: Police name suspect after studio blaze - BBC News,"Kyoto Animation fire: Police name suspect after studio blazePublished19 July 2019SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingThis video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Media caption, Kyoto Animation offices on fireJapanese police have named the man suspected of carrying out a deadly arson attack on an animation studio.Shinji Aoba was taken into police custody in hospital and was being treated there for burns.The fire swept through Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) on Thursday, claiming at least 33 lives and injuring many in one of Japan's worst mass killings in years.People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouted: ""Die!"" In the wake of the attack, dozens of people gathered outside the premises of the studio, laying flowers and offering prayers. A crowdfunding campaign has so far raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their families.KyoAni produces films and graphic novels and is well regarded by fans for the quality of its productions.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Shinji Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. He was taken to hospital for treatment and had not been formally interviewed about his motive.Image source, AFPImage caption, Since the fire was put out, investigators have been inspecting the scene for evidencePublic broadcaster NHK reported that he had a criminal record and was previously jailed for stealing money from a convenience store. Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but had no idea if they were connected to the attack. What happened?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by the blaze, which people jumped out of windows to escape from.""It was like I was looking at hell,"" a local woman told Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Image source, AFPImage caption, Authorities said most of the victims died whilst trying to escape to the building's roofAround 70 people were in the building when the fire started, and some 36 people have reportedly been taken to hospital.Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, AFPImage caption, It took firefighters five hours to bring the blaze under control, reports saidKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants – but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.Momoko Higuchi, a Tokyo-based architect, told Reuters that the blaze was probably made worse by the building's three-storey spiral staircase, which would have ""[acted] as a chimney.""""Because the fire was with petrol, the effect was like a bomb,"" Mr Higuchi added.The fire was put out and police were searching the site for evidence. Knives were reportedly found at the scene.Details of the victims were not immediately released but Kyoto police said 20 women and 12 men were among the dead. One person has not yet been identified. KyoAni is known for employing more women, particularly younger women, than is usual in the profession, industry lawyer Daisuke Okeda told the New York Times.Men aged over 35 still dominate the animation industry, Mr Okeda said, but twice as many women in their 20s work as animators compared with their male counterparts.In response to the incident, the studio has cancelled screenings for the trailer of its latest film, a spin-off of the popular swimming anime series Free. It has also delayed a collaboration with Keihan Main Line, a railway service between Kyoto and Osaka.Another Japanese animation studio, David Production, postponed the broadcast of its latest episode of Fire Force. The animated series centres on a group of firefighters who have the ability to manipulate fire.Who is Kyoto Animation?Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. It also publishes many popular graphic novels, mainly about teenage school life.KyoAni: The beloved studio making distinctive artThe studio is known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. It is also the first successful studio outside Tokyo, Prof Ryusuke Hikawa from Meiji University told NHK.More on this storyArson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019",positive,en-GB,"{'https://www.bbc.com': 4, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/': 1, 'https://account.bbc.com/account?lang=en-GB&ptrt=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49042992': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/news': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/sport': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/reel': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/worklife': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/travel': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/future': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/culture': 3, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/search': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/culture/music': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9m': 2, 'https://www.bbc.com/weather': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/can-i-share-things-from-the-bbc': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49026944': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-61224804': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-61229589': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61225355': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0016txs#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_IPLAYER~N~m0016txs~P_Navalny%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0015vfz#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~m0015vfz~P_ThingsFellApartLouisTheroux%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0c1d2qv#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~p0c1d2qv~P_MOTDTopTenEnglishPlayers%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628994': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-50068132': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628323': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/20039682': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/privacy': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/cookies': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/guidance': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcnewsletter': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342': 1, 'https://www.bbcglobalnews.com/home/': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/how-does-the-bbc-use-cookies-for-advertising/': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidance/feeds-and-links': 1}"

Pokémon started life as an 8-bit video game in Japan -  where players capture creatures and store them in pocket-sized capsules (Pokémon is short for ""pocket monsters"") - but has grown into a cultural megahit.By some estimates, Pokémon is now the biggest media franchise in history, worth more than Harry Potter and Star Wars combined. Over its 25-year journey, it has spawned several global crazes, involving celebrities paying millions for trading cards and people walking tens of thousands of kilometres in pursuit of rare monsters. These are the moments when Pokémania swept the globe.Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold!Image source, Tom BatemanImage caption, Pikachu, one of 898 monsters in the Pokémon world, is the most recognisablePokémon started small. The game's developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. ""It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,"" says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games' development team.  He turned out to be right. The series' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version. ""But we never considered selling Pokémon abroad,"" Mr Ishihara says.""People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn't play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.""Image source, Tom BatemanPokémon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pokémon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.""All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that's when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. ""The cool thing about Pokémon is it's a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there'd probably be someone that I know from Pokémon that I could probably crash with. I think that's so cool,"" he says. 16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 secondsOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. The channel, ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"", broadcast a stream of Pokémon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch's built-in chat. ""I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You've got the video, you've got the chat, it was right for something like that,"" says Marcus ""djWHEAT"" Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.Image source, TwitchImage caption, Tens of thousands of players are controlling one character""The streamer's original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I'll begin parsing them into the game and we'll see what chaos this creates,"" he says. The chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.Twitch Plays Pokémon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream's peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.

Pokémon started life as an 8-bit video game in Japan -  where players capture creatures and store them in pocket-sized capsules (Pokémon is short for ""pocket monsters"") - but has grown into a cultural megahit.By some estimates, Pokémon is now the biggest media franchise in history, worth more than Harry Potter and Star Wars combined. Over its 25-year journey, it has spawned several global crazes, involving celebrities paying millions for trading cards and people walking tens of thousands of kilometres in pursuit of rare monsters. These are the moments when Pokémania swept the globe.Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold!Image source, Tom BatemanImage caption, Pikachu, one of 898 monsters in the Pokémon world, is the most recognisablePokémon started small. The game's developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. ""It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,"" says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games' development team.  He turned out to be right. The series' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version. ""But we never considered selling Pokémon abroad,"" Mr Ishihara says.""People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn't play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.""Image source, Tom BatemanPokémon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pokémon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.""All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that's when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. ""The cool thing about Pokémon is it's a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there'd probably be someone that I know from Pokémon that I could probably crash with. I think that's so cool,"" he says. 16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 secondsOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. The channel, ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"", broadcast a stream of Pokémon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch's built-in chat. ""I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You've got the video, you've got the chat, it was right for something like that,"" says Marcus ""djWHEAT"" Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.Image source, TwitchImage caption, Tens of thousands of players are controlling one character""The streamer's original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I'll begin parsing them into the game and we'll see what chaos this creates,"" he says. The chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.Twitch Plays Pokémon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream's peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream's most beloved Pokémon to be ""released"", meaning they were lost forever.

26-04-2022,anime,1,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56178987,"Monsters, mania and the unstoppable march of Pokémon - BBC News","Monsters, mania and the unstoppable march of PokémonBy Tom BatemanTokyo, JapanPublished27 February 2021SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Tom BatemanImage caption, No-one predicted how huge this franchise would become both in and outside of JapanIn Tokyo's ritzy Roppongi neighbourhood, Tsunekazu Ishihara, president of The Pokémon Company, sits opposite a giant map of the world.Red pins mark the countries where every arm of the Pokémon empire - games, trading cards, Pokemon GO, the animated TV series - is available.There's a lot of red. Pokémon started life as an 8-bit video game in Japan -  where players capture creatures and store them in pocket-sized capsules (Pokémon is short for ""pocket monsters"") - but has grown into a cultural megahit.By some estimates, Pokémon is now the biggest media franchise in history, worth more than Harry Potter and Star Wars combined. Over its 25-year journey, it has spawned several global crazes, involving celebrities paying millions for trading cards and people walking tens of thousands of kilometres in pursuit of rare monsters. These are the moments when Pokémania swept the globe.Your very own Pokémon legend is about to unfold!Image source, Tom BatemanImage caption, Pikachu, one of 898 monsters in the Pokémon world, is the most recognisablePokémon started small. The game's developer, Game Freak, was a Tokyo-based company that had started life as a self-published video gaming magazine. ""It took about seven years to develop the games. We thought they would sell well in Japan, perhaps a million copies of each,"" says Mr Ishihara, who was part of the original games' development team.  He turned out to be right. The series' first instalments, Pokémon Red and Green, were released in Japan on 27 February 1996. They proved popular, with players using cables to link their Game Boys and trade for certain Pokémon that were exclusive to each version. ""But we never considered selling Pokémon abroad,"" Mr Ishihara says.""People said there was no chance it would work because American children wouldn't play a game where you had to read a lot of text, where there was no action and where you took turns to fight battles.""Image source, Tom BatemanPokémon Red and Blue - based on an updated version of the Japanese originals -  were released in North America in 1998 and in Europe in 1999. They were followed by Pokémon Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal.""All told, they sold 76 million copies worldwide. I was absolutely shocked,"" Mr Ishihara says.Pokémania strikesMr Ishihara believes that the tortuous process of translating the games into English was part of the success, with the North American release of the anime building hype for the delayed Game Boy games, which in turn fed demand for a newly-launched trading card game. ""As we launched more and more products and expanded the business, it became a social phenomenon,"" he says. At its height in the early 2000s that phenomenon - branded ""Pokémania"" - led religious leaders in Saudi Arabia to ban Pokémon entirely, saying the game promoted Zionism and gambling, while western media published lurid stories of ""Pokémon card crime"". There was some truth to the stories: in one incident, an eight-year-old boy in southern England caused an outcry after he phoned in to a local radio station and attempted to swap his infant sister for a holographic Vaporeon card. I want to be the very bestAlthough this wave of Pokémania died down in the years that followed, Pokémon never went away. 2008 saw the launch of a new generation of WiFi-enabled Pokémon games. Suddenly, players could trade and battle with anyone, anywhere. ""As a kid, I watched a lot of people battle on WiFi battles in 2008, that's when that really blew up on YouTube,"" says Aaron Zheng, who started a YouTube channel focused on competitive Pokémon after coaching his younger brother to victory in the games' world championships in 2013.Image source, Aaron ZhengImage caption, Aaron and Brendan Zheng at the 2011 regional championships in Washington DCThe channel led to work commentating at official Pokémon tournaments, taking Zheng from his home in New York to Australia, Brazil and the UK. ""The cool thing about Pokémon is it's a really global game. I think if I went to a big city, there'd probably be someone that I know from Pokémon that I could probably crash with. I think that's so cool,"" he says. 16 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes and 30 secondsOn 12 February 2014, a channel on the streaming service Twitch began an experiment. The channel, ""Twitch Plays Pokémon"", broadcast a stream of Pokémon Red. What was different was that viewers could play the game, interacting with it live by typing commands into Twitch's built-in chat. ""I think Twitch served as sort of that perfect platform. You've got the video, you've got the chat, it was right for something like that,"" says Marcus ""djWHEAT"" Graham, a long-time esports expert and head of creator development at Twitch.Image source, TwitchImage caption, Tens of thousands of players are controlling one character""The streamer's original system fit perfectly, like, yeah, throw me the commands, I'll begin parsing them into the game and we'll see what chaos this creates,"" he says. The chaos was compelling. More players joined in, thousands of people telling the game to do different things all at the same time.Twitch Plays Pokémon went viral, gaining widespread media attention within days. According to Twitch, the stream's peak saw over 120,000 simultaneous players trying to control the action. The sheer number of players sometimes made the game almost impossible to play.  At one point progress was held up for almost 10 hours as players repeatedly fell down a ledge, while stray button presses in an in-game menu caused some of the stream's most beloved Pokémon to be ""released"", meaning they were lost forever. But after 16 days, seven hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds of play, the stream completed the game. In all, 1.16 million people had played, and more than nine million had watched. Marcus Graham believes the ""Pokémon"" part of Twitch Plays Pokémon was the key to success, as the stream combined the simple goals of catching monsters and collecting gym badges with players' nostalgia for the classic game and its cast of familiar characters. ""I really do think that because the game was Pokémon that played a massive part in the explosive virality of it all. It was kind of that perfect storm.""Gotta catch 'em allWhile the world watched millions play Pokémon Red on Twitch, a Japanese software engineer was working on an April Fool's joke. Tatsuo Nomura (who declined to be interviewed for this article) worked for Google's maps division. A Pokémon fan since childhood, Nomura decided to blend the two, hiding Pokémon on a map of the world for users to find. Image source, PG/Bauer-Griffin""Mr Nomura used to find exploits in Pokémon Red and Green when he was a kid, that's how he became interested in computer programming,"" explains the Pokémon Company's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who greenlit the project after receiving a pitch from Google-owned game developer Niantic.""That passion led him to join Google, then Google Maps, and consequently he created Pokémon GO.""The mobile game was an instant success, introducing millions of players to a world of ""augmented reality"" gaming. To play, users must walk around in the real world in order to find and catch Pokémon on their phone screens.One Japanese player, playing under the name Kyarorina, got hooked after his workplace organised a walking competition for its staff.   ""The goal of simply walking turned into an obsession with chasing after rare Pokémon and catching them all,"" he says.The stats tell the full story: since first downloading Pokémon GO in July 2016, he has walked over 31,000km (19,200 miles) and visited more than a million Pokéstops - real-life locations where players can collect in-game items. In 2019, Kyarorina became the first person to catch one million Pokémon in-game. Image source, The Pokemon CompanyImage caption, Some of the most popular characters""Recently I've been spending about eight to 10 hours a day catching Pokémon, about 2,000 a day. I think I'll hit two million by the end of this month and announce it on Twitter,"" he tells the BBC.Pokémon GO's initial popularity was matched by its profitability. In 2020, five years after the game was first released, it saw record revenues of over $1bn (£718m). The free-to-play game makes money both by charging players for items and by charging businesses for the privilege of appearing on the in-game map. For Neriko Doerr and Debra Occhi, cultural anthropologists who co-authored a book on Pokémon GO, the game is evidence of Pokémon's broad appeal - something that can help explain the franchise's success. ""Pokemon GO attracted people who are into going outside, walking around and people who are happy with just collecting Pokemon into the game world, some of whom became very enthusiastic,"" Ms Doerr says.The red pinsAs Pokémon's 25th birthday approached, the franchise once again hit headlines as YouTuber Logan Paul paid $2m for six boxes of vintage Pokémon cards.""This is a newfound obsession of mine and I am so excited to share it with other enthusiasts around the world,"" the controversial entertainer wrote on social media.  Image source, Yvonne Hemsey""Pokemon cards have always been highly prized,"" says Tracy Martin, an expert in valuing post-war collectables. ""This is down to nostalgia and obviously the rarity of a card, but also Pokemon is still very current. It's a phenomenon that seems to grip both children and adults, and that's the main reason why it's still going strong,"" she says. ""That was not what we expected,"" says Pokémon's Tsunekazu Ishihara, who was himself featured on a Pokémon card that last year sold for $50,000.So what does Ishihara expect the next 25 years will bring for Pokémon? ""World domination"" he says, eyes fixed on the red pins that dot his map.

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time. Thank you KyoAni, for making my life a little more brighter. pic.twitter.com/bu1GB6VO59— Asher Edlin (@TheAfroOtaku) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""This company produced so many anime that helped shape me into who I am. Most of which were absolute masterpieces,"" wrote donor Darrian Harrison. ""KyoAni's works have been a part of my childhood,"" said LC Mendoza. Another donor, Mackenzie Haa, said Kyoto Animation ""is a model for the anime industry and deserves so much better than this.  I hope they come back stronger than ever after this tragedy"".Across the internet, fans are posting messages of condolence and support on discussion forums and message boards.Condolences to the staff at KyoAni https://t.co/1bdggx7ofd pic.twitter.com/NRR2u4aEdt— Maruse Rino (@maruse_rino) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterThoughts with @kyoani!

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time. Thank you KyoAni, for making my life a little more brighter. pic.twitter.com/bu1GB6VO59— Asher Edlin (@TheAfroOtaku) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""This company produced so many anime that helped shape me into who I am.

All of the anime community stands at your back. We will always catch you when you fall,"" are highlighting the special role the studio played for its fans. More victims are thought to be unaccounted for, while some 40 people are in hospital, reports say.Local police say they believe the fire was started by a man who broke into the studio on Thursday and ignited petrol. A special studio cultureKyoAni was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.The studio also released a standalone feature anime A Silent Voice, in 2016. One of KyoAni's series, Violet Evergarden, was picked up by Netflix for a global market. #KyoAniStrong pic.twitter.com/nbLItFhEsF— Troy the Panda (@TheImpactPanda) July 18, 2019 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter""One of the main things that stands out about Kyoto Animation is the quality of the animation itself,"" said Ian Wolf, an anime critic for Anime UK News. ""It's very viewer-friendly.""The distinctive visual style and level of polish leads to a look that is instantly recognisable, Wolf said.""The studio makes very little in the way that is controversial... little that is violent or sexual. I can't imagine why anyone would want to attack it.""Some recent projects include Free, a show about a school boys' swimming team which has proved popular among women, and is set to have its own spin-off film to coincide with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.A Silent Voice, on the other hand, is a stand-alone film based on a manga by Yoshitoki Oima. It is about a bully who torments a classmate with a hearing impairment, but later must come to terms with his actions when he is bullied himself. The Guardian gave it a four-star review, calling it ""a beguiling film: subtle, sensuous and delicate"".Aside from the quality of its content, the studio is also well regarded for the way it makes it. One Reddit user discussing the attack labelled it ""a beacon of what the anime industry should be"" for its staff policies and in-house training.That, Wolf said, was partly down to how their staff were paid.The studio is also known for paying its animators a regular salary, breaking with the industry's standard of paying per frame - which is seen as putting extreme pressure on staff. Tributes and donations""It's one of the best and largest animation firms in Japan,"" Tokyo-based film commentator Yuichi Maeda told Reuters news agency. ""With that loss of life, many of the best hands at animation in the nation are likely to be dead.""He said the studio's impact on the industry was much larger than the number of works it made would suggest. ""It's too painful to contemplate.""""It has a huge presence in animation here. To have this many people die at once will be a huge blow to the Japanese animation industry,"" he said.While KyoAni may be best known in Japan, news of the attack led to a huge outpouring of support from the anime community across the world.A GoFundMe campaign, started when the news broke, raised almost $100,000 (£80,000) in two hours, rising to more than $200,000 by 19:00 Tokyo time (10:00 GMT).It was started by Sentai Filmworks, a US-based distributor of Japanese cultural works. The vast majority of donations were small amounts of $50 or less from fans.It utterly breaks my heart after hearing what happened to #KyotoAnimation. It was through most of their titles that got me closer to the anime fandom, and made some of my favorite titles of all time.

It means new people will be introduced to ""the ultimate escapism"" of Studio Ghibli's films - up until now they've only been available on DVD, when they're broadcast on Film 4, or illegally. Some of its most famous films include the Oscar-winning Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle.""It will really give people the chance to enjoy a lot of classics that they may not know about but are famous in the anime world,"" says Sarah Taylor, whose heart has ""been with Ghibli"" since she was 16 years old.When those Studio Ghibli films drop on Netflix I’m going into hibernation for a week— ً (@whoisjoshva) January 20, 2020 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterEVERYONE FORGET DISNEY PLUS BECAUSE NETFLIX WILL HAVE STUDIO GHIBLI OHMYGOD pic.twitter.com/vOo5M3NxtF— ivy marie 🥂🎷🎆 (@ivysaysrawr) January 20, 2020 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on TwitterIf you aren't familiar, Studio Ghibli is a Japanese animation film studio founded in 1985 by animators Miyazaki Hayao and Takahata Isao.They are best known for their anime feature films.""I believe in the power of story. I believe that stories have an important role to play in the formation of human beings, that they can stimulate, amaze and inspire their listeners,"" Miyazaki Hayao said in a 2002 interview.So what does this mean to fans?We spoke to three Studio Ghibli superfans who couldn't contain their excitement after hearing the announcement.Image source, Sarah TaylorImage caption, Sarah's favourite Studio Ghibli film is Howl's Moving CastleSarah Taylor was first introduced to the films by her Japanese housemate. ""I saw some artwork on her wall and I thought - 'What is this? This is amazing'.""She showed me the film and I was captivated, it really showed me what Japanese life could look like with a thrilling magical element on top,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.""When I say I love anime people sort of roll their eyes a bit unless they have seen some and understand it. ""People still think it's just cartoons, but they're grown-up films.""'It's the ultimate escapism'We didn't have to look too far to find the next superfan: Laura Bailey is a ""massive anime fan"" - and she's an assistant producer at BBC 1Xtra, round the corner from us at Newsbeat.Image source, AlamyImage caption, My Neighbour Totoro, from 1988, is one of Studio Ghibli's most famous films""It's great to have it on Netflix because people are really getting introduced into anime and are going to be able to watch the classic movies and understand what all the hype is about,"" Laura says. She says the traditional stereotype of someone who watches anime is changing over time. ""I know a lot of rappers like AJ Tracey have spoken about watching anime, I don't think it's like a weird or geeky thing as much as it used to be when I was growing up,"" Laura says.""It's the ultimate escapism, its like a Japanese Disney. It will take you to a different world if you ever grew up with cartoons.""A podcast... all about Studio Ghibli?Yes, you heard it right. Jake Cunningham is co-host of the Ghibliotheque podcast - despite only watching his first Studio Ghibli film only 18 months ago.Each week for the podcast he's given a film to watch by his superfan co-host, and has now watched them all. Image source, AlamyImage caption, Spirited Away won the Oscar for best animated film in 2003, when the other nominees were Ice Age, Lilo & Stitch, Spirit and Treasure Planet""It's been such a humongous learning curve for me, I've loved every aspect of it.

She said the man was carrying two boxes that appeared to contain petrol cans.Two students also reported seeing a man on Wednesday evening dressed similarly to the suspect. One of the students said the man resembled Mr Aoba and was lying on a bench approximately 500m (1640ft) away from the office.What do we know about the suspect?Police detained Mr Aoba on suspicion of setting fire to the building. Mr Aoba had allegedly accused the animation studio of plagiarising his novel. People who witnessed Shinji Aoba's arrest said they heard him complaining that the company had stolen his ideas.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A crowdfunding campaign has raised more than $1.3m (£1.04m) to assist victims and their familiesHe was taken to hospital in Kyoto and, on Saturday, transferred to a hospital in Osaka.

Kyoto Animation's president said he had recently received threatening letters but did not know if they were connected to the attack.What happened on Thursday?The fire broke out at the three-storey building at about 10:30 local time (01:35 GMT). Eyewitnesses described a loud explosion followed by a blaze, causing people to jump out of windows to escape.Police said the attacker entered the building and splashed flammable liquid from a bucket before setting it alight, and shouting: ""Die!""Authorities said most of the victims were found piled up on a stairway leading from the building's third floor up to the roof, where they collapsed trying to escape.Image source, ReutersImage caption, A firefighter inspects the interior of the torched Kyoto Animation buildingKyodo news agency said firefighters had found the door to the roof was shut, leaving people trapped inside. A Kyoto fire official also told Reuters news agency that the building did not have any sprinklers or indoor fire hydrants - but did not need them to comply with Japan's fire code.The fire was put out and police investigators searched the site for evidence.Kyoto Animation was founded in 1981 and has produced popular animation shows including K-On and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. The studio also creates film versions of some of its popular franchises, and released the standalone feature A Silent Voice in 2016 to critical acclaim.More on this storyPolice name suspect in Japan animation studio fire19 July 2019Arson attack at Japan anime studio kills 3318 July 2019Kyoto Animation studio on fire18 July 2019Fans heartbroken by anime studio fire in Japan18 July 2019Top StoriesLive. Germany to send tanks to Ukraine in U-turnChinese tutors killed in Karachi university attackPublished1 hour agoElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter usersPublished7 minutes agoFeaturesUkrainian border village where rockets litter roadsThe Ukrainian defence unit holding the line in DonbasWhy Australia has compulsory voting.

It deals with themes from growing up to the importance of friendship, often along with graphic violence and some sexual undertones.It has been around for decades in Japan and gained a foothold in the West in the 1990s, but reached a new level of popularity around the world in the past few years.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The film follows high school student Yuta OkkotsuNetflix says more than 100 million households around the world watched at least one anime title in the first nine months of 2020, a 50% increase from 2019. Meanwhile, anime only sites like Crunchyroll have also seen a rise in viewers.Shiro Yoshioka, a lecturer in Japanese studies at Newcastle University, says streaming sites have ""lowered the barrier to be a fan of anime significantly and has helped it become more mainstream than it used to be"".Jujutsu Kaisen 0 made almost $15m (£11m) at US and Canadian cinemas last weekend and another £825,000 in the UK and Ireland.'Masterful' film""This is a terrific opening,"" David A Gross, who runs movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, told Reuters. ""Reviews are exceptional for this and for all of Funimation/Crunchyroll movies. They have not missed.""Those reviews included one in The Guardian, which said the ""dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens"".Directed by Sunghoo Park, it has more graphic violence than some previous Japanese animations as a result of its darker themes and tone. The film comes after the success of Demon Slayer, which became the highest-grossing anime film worldwide, making $90m (£68m) outside Japan in 2021 despite being released during the pandemic.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The manga/comic books the film was based on sold more than 60 million copies in JapanCrunchyroll released Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in US cinemas and has seen its streaming numbers go from one million paid subscribers in 2017 to five million last year. Sony bought the company for $1.175bn (£900m) in 2021.Chief content officer Asa Suehira said the growth of streaming and video games had led to ""more fans with a comfort and interest around adult dramatic animation"".Dr Yoshioka believes it is ""the complexity and difference from Western visual media that attract young people to anime"".He adds: ""There is still a mindset in the West that animation is for children, whereas in Japan, the genre is for audiences of all ages, and the content reflects that.""Dr Filippo Cervelli, a lecturer in modern Japanese literature at the SOAS University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), has seen an increase in the number of students writing theses on anime.""This shows how anime are appreciated but are also seen as sources of cultural insights,"" he says. ""Many popular anime show Japanese urban backgrounds, Japanese food and other elements of daily life that can be new and attractive to UK audiences used to different architectures or daily rhythms.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The Guardian described the film as ""bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once""For a growing number of parents, they may wonder whether the content their children are watching is appropriate.Vansh Gulati from Epic Dope, a site dedicated to all things anime, says it should not be confused with hentai - or Japanese animated pornography. ""Many parents think of anime to be porn disguised as aesthetic glitter-covered cartoons,"" he says.He advises that, like any other form of media, parents should monitor what their children watch. They can also read reviews, check age ratings and make sure they don't stray into shows rated for adults.Anna Parker-Naples, a parent of three, thinks anime has its benefits but it's important to know what your children are watching. ""Sometimes the way that death is portrayed, even if it's graphics, can be quite bloody and brutal. I think it's the adult themes woven into some of the stories. We just never know at what point they're going to become overly violent.""We want to make sure we're on board with what they are watching. So quite often, we will watch a few episodes of the series before we let them watch something.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some fans spend a lot of time drawing characters from or inspired by their favourite anime shows or manga booksOne of her children is drawn to the artistry of anime because some of it can be ""quite beautiful"", she adds.""For us, watching our children be inspired by something that they were then wanting to draw and be creative, we quite like that.""For some fans, especially for younger viewers, having something in common with other like-minded people brings about a sense of belonging and acceptance.""I think they sort of self-identify with all the people that watch anime. They know who is into it, so even if they're not all friends together, they recognise that they're part of it.""More on this storyMonsters, mania and the unstoppable march of Pokémon27 February 2021Learn how to draw Totoro12 May 2020Studio Ghibli on Netflix: 'It's like a Japanese Disney'20 January 2020Related TopicsAnimeTelevisionStreamingFilmJapanTop StoriesLive. Germany to send tanks to Ukraine in U-turnChinese tutors killed in Karachi university attackPublished1 hour agoElon Musk warned he must protect Twitter usersPublished9 minutes agoFeaturesUkrainian border village where rockets litter roadsThe Ukrainian defence unit holding the line in DonbasWhy Australia has compulsory voting.

26-04-2022,anime,12,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60865649,Anime: How Japanese animation has taken the West by storm - BBC News,"Anime: How Japanese animation has taken the West by stormBy Becky Padington & Ian YoungsBBC NewsPublished26 MarchSharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, Jujutsu Kaisen 0 was second in the UK and US box office charts last weekend, behind The BatmanJapanese animation Jujutsu Kaisen 0 has become a surprise box office hit, as anime enjoys a new global popularity in cinemas and on streaming services.Last weekend, an animated Japanese high school student who is haunted by the spirit of his childhood sweetheart was second only to The Batman in the UK box office chart, and beat Catherine Tate and Sir Mark Rylance, who starred in other new releases.Jujutsu Kaisen 0 - a prequel to a successful streaming TV series, itself based on popular manga comics - has become the latest successful anime export.Anime is known for its distinctive style using bold colours, pronounced and expressive facial features, and far-out storylines. It deals with themes from growing up to the importance of friendship, often along with graphic violence and some sexual undertones.It has been around for decades in Japan and gained a foothold in the West in the 1990s, but reached a new level of popularity around the world in the past few years.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The film follows high school student Yuta OkkotsuNetflix says more than 100 million households around the world watched at least one anime title in the first nine months of 2020, a 50% increase from 2019. Meanwhile, anime only sites like Crunchyroll have also seen a rise in viewers.Shiro Yoshioka, a lecturer in Japanese studies at Newcastle University, says streaming sites have ""lowered the barrier to be a fan of anime significantly and has helped it become more mainstream than it used to be"".Jujutsu Kaisen 0 made almost $15m (£11m) at US and Canadian cinemas last weekend and another £825,000 in the UK and Ireland.'Masterful' film""This is a terrific opening,"" David A Gross, who runs movie consulting firm Franchise Entertainment Research, told Reuters. ""Reviews are exceptional for this and for all of Funimation/Crunchyroll movies. They have not missed.""Those reviews included one in The Guardian, which said the ""dazzling coming-of-age tale masterfully contemplates the knotty process of coming to terms with past traumas through a horror-fantasy lens"".Directed by Sunghoo Park, it has more graphic violence than some previous Japanese animations as a result of its darker themes and tone. The film comes after the success of Demon Slayer, which became the highest-grossing anime film worldwide, making $90m (£68m) outside Japan in 2021 despite being released during the pandemic.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The manga/comic books the film was based on sold more than 60 million copies in JapanCrunchyroll released Jujutsu Kaisen 0 in US cinemas and has seen its streaming numbers go from one million paid subscribers in 2017 to five million last year. Sony bought the company for $1.175bn (£900m) in 2021.Chief content officer Asa Suehira said the growth of streaming and video games had led to ""more fans with a comfort and interest around adult dramatic animation"".Dr Yoshioka believes it is ""the complexity and difference from Western visual media that attract young people to anime"".He adds: ""There is still a mindset in the West that animation is for children, whereas in Japan, the genre is for audiences of all ages, and the content reflects that.""Dr Filippo Cervelli, a lecturer in modern Japanese literature at the SOAS University of London (School of Oriental and African Studies), has seen an increase in the number of students writing theses on anime.""This shows how anime are appreciated but are also seen as sources of cultural insights,"" he says. ""Many popular anime show Japanese urban backgrounds, Japanese food and other elements of daily life that can be new and attractive to UK audiences used to different architectures or daily rhythms.Image source, Gege Akutami/ShueishaImage caption, The Guardian described the film as ""bloody, action-packed and tragicomic all at once""For a growing number of parents, they may wonder whether the content their children are watching is appropriate.Vansh Gulati from Epic Dope, a site dedicated to all things anime, says it should not be confused with hentai - or Japanese animated pornography. ""Many parents think of anime to be porn disguised as aesthetic glitter-covered cartoons,"" he says.He advises that, like any other form of media, parents should monitor what their children watch. They can also read reviews, check age ratings and make sure they don't stray into shows rated for adults.Anna Parker-Naples, a parent of three, thinks anime has its benefits but it's important to know what your children are watching. ""Sometimes the way that death is portrayed, even if it's graphics, can be quite bloody and brutal. I think it's the adult themes woven into some of the stories. We just never know at what point they're going to become overly violent.""We want to make sure we're on board with what they are watching. So quite often, we will watch a few episodes of the series before we let them watch something.""Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Some fans spend a lot of time drawing characters from or inspired by their favourite anime shows or manga booksOne of her children is drawn to the artistry of anime because some of it can be ""quite beautiful"", she adds.""For us, watching our children be inspired by something that they were then wanting to draw and be creative, we quite like that.""For some fans, especially for younger viewers, having something in common with other like-minded people brings about a sense of belonging and acceptance.""I think they sort of self-identify with all the people that watch anime. They know who is into it, so even if they're not all friends together, they recognise that they're part of it.""More on this storyMonsters, mania and the unstoppable march of Pokémon27 February 2021Learn how to draw Totoro12 May 2020Studio Ghibli on Netflix: 'It's like a Japanese Disney'20 January 2020Related TopicsAnimeTelevisionStreamingFilmJapan",positive,en-GB,"{'https://www.bbc.com': 4, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/': 1, 'https://account.bbc.com/account?lang=en-GB&ptrt=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-60865649': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/news': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/sport': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/reel': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/worklife': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/travel': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/future': 3, 'https://www.bbc.com/culture': 3, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/search': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/culture/music': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9m': 2, 'https://www.bbc.com/weather': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/can-i-share-things-from-the-bbc': 1, 'https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/15/jujutsu-kaisen-0-review-sorcerer-anime-series-gets-a-spectacular-prequel': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-61224804': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-61229589': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61225355': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0c1d2qv#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~p0c1d2qv~P_MOTDTopTenEnglishPlayers%5D': 2, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0015vfz#xtor=CS8-1000-%5BPromo_Box%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BNews_Promo%5D-%5BPS_SOUNDS~N~m0015vfz~P_ThingsFellApartLouisTheroux%5D': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628994': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-50068132': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10628323': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/20039682': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/privacy': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/cookies': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/guidance': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcnewsletter': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/help-41670342': 1, 'https://www.bbcglobalnews.com/home/': 1, 'https://www.bbc.com/usingthebbc/cookies/how-does-the-bbc-use-cookies-for-advertising/': 1, 'https://www.bbc.co.uk/editorialguidelines/guidance/feeds-and-links': 1}"

This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we've seen before.Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The judging panel consists of THE9's Esther Yu, actress Angelababy and rapper Lil Ghost - a former talent show discoveryiQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray.Among the 31 virtual contenders, there's an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show's judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards.Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman.  On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Why I 'married' a cartoon characterThe curious rise of virtual celebritiesK-pop band's panda cuddle raises hackles in ChinaTalent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain's Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China's youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that's why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London's Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend's game character Akali perform 'offline' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year's research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters 'to life'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show's judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they're multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China's Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China's Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show's design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we've seen before.Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The judging panel consists of THE9's Esther Yu, actress Angelababy and rapper Lil Ghost - a former talent show discoveryiQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray.Among the 31 virtual contenders, there's an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show's judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards.Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman.  On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Why I 'married' a cartoon characterThe curious rise of virtual celebritiesK-pop band's panda cuddle raises hackles in ChinaTalent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain's Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China's youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that's why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London's Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend's game character Akali perform 'offline' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year's research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters 'to life'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show's judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they're multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China's Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China's Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show's design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

26-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54967096,China gives musical talent show a virtual makeover - BBC News,"China gives musical talent show a virtual makeoverBy Lu-Hai LiangBBC NewsPublished22 November 2020SharecloseShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingImage source, iQIYIImage caption, Contestants on Dimension Nova are either 2D or 3D and are judged on their personality, style and back story, as well as their performanceAt first glance, there's nothing very remarkable about yet another singing competition in talent show-obsessed China, but Dimension Nova is different - this time, all the contestants are virtual. This ""virtual idol variety show"", from Chinese streaming platform iQIYI, features three celebrity judges hoping to find the next big star. Yet while the concept is familiar, the execution is like nothing we've seen before.Contestants walk out into a capacious hall, complete with a looming T-Rex skeleton hanging from the high ceiling, and perform to the judging panel in real-time. But these hopefuls are not your familiar pub-gigging wannabes, instead they are digital creations, drawn and styled like Japanese anime figures. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The judging panel consists of THE9's Esther Yu, actress Angelababy and rapper Lil Ghost - a former talent show discoveryiQIYI, best known for popular talent shows such as The Rap of China, are exploring futuristic territory with their latest TV foray.Among the 31 virtual contenders, there's an anthropomorphic five-tailed fox dressed in a suit and a cutesy monosyllabic seal, both auditioning for a spot on the judges' teams. ""It seems like I stepped into a video game,"" says Angelababy, one of the show's judges, in the first episode. The model-turned-actress is ubiquitous in China, her image dominating screens and billboards.Virtual celebrities, however, are not entirely new. In Japan, Hatsune Miku has won a large fanbase since her 2007 debut, despite being virtual. First appearing as a voice-synthesising program, she has featured on TV, in concert and even appeared on the Late Show With David Letterman.  On Instagram, the virtual influencer and music artist Lil Miquela has some 2.8m followers; closer to home, UK indie band Gorillaz consists solely of cartoon members. Why I 'married' a cartoon characterThe curious rise of virtual celebritiesK-pop band's panda cuddle raises hackles in ChinaTalent shows have become big business in China, with Western-influenced singing competitions such as The Voice of China a huge hit with homegrown audiences. In 2018, Britain's Jessie J enrolled as a contestant - and won - the Chinese talent show Singer, significantly boosting her international fanbase.But in recent years, these talent shows have become increasingly like their Japanese and South Korean counterparts and, arguably, formulaic. Shows like Produce 101 and Youth With You, which are popular among China's youth demographic, ""follow the trainee system used for Korean idols"" explains Ina Yang, a Chinese pop-culture podcast host, and have adopted the glamorous - and gruelling - group idol culture popularised by K-pop. But this latest talent show is breaking new ground. Technical challenges""We started from zero with Dimension Nova, as variety shows featuring virtual idols had never been done before,"" executive producer Liu Jiachao told the BBC. He says the virtual reality (VR) technology involved has proved very demanding, adding, ""that's why we only chose 31 contestants out of the 150 or more candidates that we screened"".  The makers of Dimension Nova are keen to show viewers the technology behind the scenes and frequently intercut the virtual performances with shots of a dark studio humming with computers. In fact, it was a computer game spin-off that sparked the idea that would evolve into Dimension Nova. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The virtual set has echoes of London's Natural History museum - including a dinosaur skeleton""The original idea came to us in September 2019, when we saw League of Legend's game character Akali perform 'offline' as a virtual idol,"" says Liu.   Watching Akali on screen convinced Liu that technology had progressed to a level where it could produce sophisticated VR performances. What followed was about a year's research and development to get the show off the ground. And there were many challenges along the way. ""The production procedure of traditional reality shows does not apply in the case of Dimension Nova - so there was no standard practice to refer to,"" says Liu. Image source, iQIYIImage caption, The computer-animated performers offer the full panoply of musical styles, from rap to Chinese FolkThe show auditioned more than 150 virtual idols from studios who produce such creations and chose candidates that met the technological requirements of their production. ""We then worked together with the companies that designed these idols to create the performances that ended up on the show.""Subsequently, the producers worked with Norwegian visual production company Vizrt, and videogame software Unreal Engine 4, as well as nine augmented reality cameras to bring the virtual characters 'to life'. ""The cameras and monitors on set had to be re-positioned and re-adjusted repeatedly to capture the natural interaction between the show's judges and virtual idol contestants,"" says Liu.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, ""Virtual characters are actually like real people: they're multi-dimensional,"" says one animator and Manga artist, in an introduction to the show.The creation of virtual idols and influencers is a burgeoning market. Tanya Van Gastel, a Chinese technology analyst who follows the industry, believes virtual influencers (VI) are the ultimate marketing tool. Unlike their flesh-and-bone counterparts, VIs can work all hours and can be created with different niches in mind. Moreover, they appeal to the younger, online-savvy generation, Gastel explains. Virtual influencers offer tantalising commercial opportunities too, and brands such as KFC, Prada, Calvin Klein, and Vogue China are among those using them in their marketing. China's Gen Z - often defined as those born after 1995 - are a lucrative demographic and more open to these non-physical influencers.  They number almost 170 million and are even more lavish spenders than their predecessors, Chinese millennials. Many among China's Gen Z are fans of ACG (anime, comics, games), observes Ina Yang, and there is considerable overlap between these three genres. Dimension Nova, which combines anime-styled contestants with the narrative elements inherent to all talent shows, has targeted this audience.  Image source, iQIYIImage caption, Japanese manga and anime is a strong influence on the show's design""Virtual idol is not a foreign concept to Gen-Zers,"" says executive producer Liu. ""In China and overseas, there are successful cases of virtual idols building and maintaining large fanbases, such as Hatsune Miku and Luo Tianyi, for example."" Establishing a virtual idol is a committed process, notes Van Gastel, but can be very creative. Storylines are written and social media accounts created for each idol. Talent shows in China have high levels of audience participation, with social media leveraged to a greater degree than their Western counterparts. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media platform, Dimension Nova has already generated 690 million reads and 6.9 million comments and posts. The show is at once a talent contest, a technological showcase, and a commercial vehicle - with the stated aim of introducing the concept and culture of virtual idols to a wider audience. ""So far, the Chinese market of virtual idol remains untapped,"" says Liu. ""The goal of Dimension Nova is to expand the market influence of this industry and drive the growth of companies from all parts of the industrial chain. ""This growth will eventually unleash the potential of the whole industry and allow the market to thrive.""

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan's hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan's elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews. But he has also received a huge number of messages of support from strangers.""A number of people kind of 'came out',"" he says. They wrote to him to tell him about their own affection for an anime character. ""I received so many messages like that. So, I thought it was worthwhile.""Now he works in a secondary school where he's open about his relationship status. Some of the staff find it weird but he says the students tend to be more accepting. He's working and socialising again and he has his own apartment - two tidy rooms in a quiet suburb, with his name and Miku's written above the doorbell.And most importantly he's happy.""In this society there's a template of what makes one happy - get married, have children, form a family. But that shouldn't be the only way. I don't fall into that template. ""We have to consider all kinds of love and all kinds of happiness.""You may also be interested in:Megumi was a baby when her parents separated and her father disappeared from her life.

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her.""

An increasing number of otaku now say they have fallen in love with anime characters and given up on the idea of real-world romance, reports the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty.Akihiko Kondo wakes up every day to the sound of his wife's voice. She calls him from across the room in her high-pitched, girlish, sing-song voice. She dances and swirls around, urging him to get out of bed. At the same time, he's holding her in his arms on the bottom tier of their metal-framed bunk bed - and if he was more awake he could be watching an illustrated cartoon of her singing on YouTube.This is because Akihiko's ""wife"" is an idea - an anime character called Miku. Image source, Getty ImagesShe's the hologram that lives in a glass capsule on a shelf in the corner of the room, and the cuddly toy with its big soft head and small body that he holds close at night. But she can take innumerable other forms.Each representation includes some essential characteristics, Akihiko says - including bright turquoise-coloured hair tied up in two long bunches, with a thick fringe framing her face.Beyond that, Miku varies. She may be a childish, cartoon-like creature, or she may be more human, and sexier - with a low neckline and big boobs, schoolgirl blouse and short skirt. Akihiko considers all of these Mikus to be his wife.The couple had a ceremony that Akihiko regards as a wedding in November last year. It wasn't official, but it was a pretty big bash with 39 guests. The number spells her name in Japanese - three for ""mi"" and nine for ""ku"". Miku was present in the form of a cuddly toy, wearing a white, lace dress and a long veil, her outfit hand-made by a designer, who contacted Akihiko after he announced his engagement. Akihiko himself wore a pure white coat and tails with white flowers in his lapel, his usual square-framed glasses and a big grin. He held her and her bouquet - one of her trademarks, a bunch of leeks tied with a big pink bow.He said their vows and walked down the aisle holding her by his side, as guests smiled and clapped. Later they sat at the top table for dinner. Akihiko in one white chair and Miku in another, propped up in an empty flower vase.Watching a video of the occasion, Akihiko smiles.""There are two reasons why I had a wedding publicly,"" he says. ""The first one is to prove my love to Miku. The second one is there are many young otaku people like me falling in love with anime characters. I want to show the world that I support them.""Image source, Getty ImagesOtaku is a Japanese word for a nerd or a geek, usually someone that's obsessed with video games and anime. A lot of gaming and anime obsessives wear the name with pride but it can also be used as a derogatory term for people who are socially awkward.Some, like Akihiko, take their obsession to what some may consider an extreme level, turning away from real-life relationships. And it appears that their numbers are increasing.Last year Gatebox, the company that made Akihiko's hologram of Miku, started issuing unofficial ""marriage certificates"" to customers; they say 3,700 people took them up on the offer.That alone may not prove very much, but they are not the only ones reporting a rise in pseudo-relationships.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The hologram version of MikuProf Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who also runs an agony aunt column answering questions on family and relationships for the Yomiuri newspaper, has for years carried out regular surveys asking young people what they feel affection for.The list includes pets, pop stars, sports stars, anime characters, and virtual idols (digitally animated, anime-inspired YouTube stars). He also asks if people visit cafes where they are waited on by young women dressed up as maids, or use prostitution services that offer companionship as well as sex.All of these pseudo-relationships are growing, he says. In this year's survey, about 12% of young people reported sometimes or often falling in love with an anime or video game character. But what could be driving this trend?It has a lot to do with economics and tradition, Yamada says, primarily the fact that many Japanese women won't consider a boyfriend unless he makes a lot of money. In 2016, 47% of women aged between 20 and 29 agreed with the statement that husbands should work for money and wives should do housework, he points out - a higher proportion than in any other age group, including the over-70s.""In Asia, Japan and South Korea, people are quite obsessed about this high salary and this tendency is not getting any weaker, it's getting stronger,"" he says.""Japanese women tend not to believe in eternal love, but they can trust money.""This sounds like a sweeping statement - one that comes close to blaming a generation of women for the problem - but Yamada says it's a conclusion he has drawn after extensive surveys.""In Japan working life is very, very hard and there is still a lot of sexual discrimination. Working hours are very long and there's lots of stress,"" he says.Also, the burden of childcare is still firmly on the mother. Long hours, high-stress workplaces and long commutes make life difficult for working mothers. The easier option is to quit - but that's not possible unless your partner earns a certain amount of money.At the same time there's a dwindling pool of well-paid men: as Japan's economy stagnates, wages are falling. The result, he says, is an increasing number of young women who choose not to date and an increasing number of young men who know enough not to bother trying.Akihiko never really entertained the idea of having a real-life girlfriend.""I've never felt attracted to real women,"" he says. Why not, I ask? ""Because I'm not popular among women,"" he replies.In school he was bullied for being an otaku. And bullying followed him into the world of work. He was working as an administrator in a primary school about 12 years ago when he was picked upon incessantly by two women - one was close to his age, one was a lot older. When he greeted them in the morning they would ignore him. They would stand in the kitchen where he could hear them and call him names. And if he made a small mistake they would shout at him, sometimes in front of the young students which he found humiliating.The bullying got so intolerable that he left work. For almost two years he locked himself in his room and refused to leave.Image source, Getty Images""I was hikikomori,"" he says. This is a well-known phenomenon in Japan and South Korea where young people, mostly men, become hermits in their own parental homes, refusing to go outside or even to speak to their families. There are estimated to be about one million of them and it can go on for many years. But then he met Miku. ""I was watching her video on YouTube and Niconico (a Japanese version of YouTube), looking at her images, listening to her songs, and I was healed by her,"" he says. The constant bullying, he felt, had forced him to shut down, to retreat into a state where he was emotionally void. He was deeply and darkly depressed. ""Listening to her songs sometimes makes me very emotional. How she dances, moves and talks makes me feel. My heart starts moving again,"" he says.""That's why I love her and why she's so important to me.""He started to feel like he was in a relationship with her, and with the support of that relationship he was able to go back to work. ""The emotion was no different from a real relationship,"" he says. ""After I fell for her. You feel the pressure in your chest. I experienced this feeling, just like falling in love with a real person.""He says he dated her for 10 years before he decided to marry her. For much of those 10 years Akihiko was only able to talk to Miku in his mind. Now he can have basic but significant conversations with his Gatebox hologram. He can tell her he loves her and she can respond. But they can't do much else.""I have to use some imagination in between,"" he says.""Of course, if I could touch her that would be fantastic. Now we can't do that. But in the future, the technology will develop. In the future, maybe I can hold her hands or hug her."" Rent-a-sister: Coaxing Japan's hikikomori out of their roomsLiving the anime lifestyleJapan's elderly crime waveAkihiko is well aware that many people think his marriage is strange. The one disappointment about his wedding was that his mother and sister refused to attend.And he gets a lot of abuse from people online, especially after going public with his marriage in several interviews.

How will it change us? And how close is “close”? Ghost in the Shell imagines a futuristic, hi-tech but grimy and ghetto-ridden Japanese metropolis populated by people, robots, and technologically-enhanced human cyborgs.Beyond the superhuman strength, resilience, and X-ray vision provided by bodily enhancements, one of the most transformative aspects of this world is the idea of brain augmentation, that as cyborgs we might have two brains rather than one. Our biological brain – the “ghost” in the “shell” – would interface via neural implants to powerful embedded computers that would give us lightening fast reactions and heightened powers of reasoning, learning and memory.First written as a Manga comic series in 1989 during the early days of the internet, Ghost in the Shell’s creator, Japanese artist Masamune Shirow, foresaw that this brain-computer interface would overcome the fundamental limitation of the human condition: that our minds are trapped inside our heads. In Shirow’s transhuman future our minds would be free to roam, relaying thoughts and imaginings to other networked brains, entering via the cloud into distant devices and sensors, even “deep diving” the mind of another in order to understand and share their experiences.Shirow’s stories also pin-pointed some of the dangers of this giant technological leap. In a world where knowledge is power, these brain-computer interfaces would create new tools for government surveillance and control, and new kinds of crime such as “mind-jacking” – the remote control of another’s thoughts and actions. Nevertheless there was also a spiritual side to Shirow’s narrative: that the cyborg condition might be the next step in our evolution, and that the widening of perspective and the merging of individuality from a networking of minds could be a path to enlightenment.Lost in translationBorrowing heavily from Ghost in the Shell’s re-telling by director Mamoru Oshii in his classic 1995 animated film version, the newly arrived Hollywood cinematic interpretation stars Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cyborg working for Section 9, a government-run security organisation charged with fighting corruption and terrorism. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the new film is visually stunning and the storyline lovingly recreates some of the best scenes from the original anime.Sadly though, Sanders’ movie pulls its punches around the core question of how this technology could change the human condition. Indeed, if casting Western actors in most key roles wasn’t enough, the new film also engages in a form of cultural appropriation by superimposing the myth of the American all-action hero – who you are is defined by what you do – on a character who is almost the complete antithesis of that notion.Major fights the battles of her masters with increasing reluctance, questioning the actions asked of her, drawn to escape and contemplation. This is no action hero, but someone trying to piece together fragments of meaning from within her cyborg existence with which to assemble a worthwhile life.✕Ghost In The ShellA scene midway through the film shows, even more bluntly, the central role of memory in creating the self. We see the complete breakdown of a man who, having been mind-jacked, faces the realisation that his identity is built on false memories of a life never lived, and a family who never existed. The 1995 anime insists that we are individuals only because of our memories. While the new film retains much of the same story line, it refuses to follow the inference. Rather than being defined by our memories, Major’s voice tells us that “we cling to memories as if they define us, but what we do defines us”. Perhaps this is meant to be reassuring, but to me it is both confusing and unfaithful to the spirit of the original tale.The new film also backs away from another key idea of Shirow’s work, that the human mind – even the human species – are, in essence, information. Where the 1995 anime talked of the possibility of leaving the physical body – the shell – elevating consciousness to a higher plane and “becoming part of all things”, the remake has only veiled hints that such a merging minds, or a melding of the human mind with the internet, could be either positive or transformational.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upOpen livesIn the real world, the notion of networked minds is already upon us. Touchscreens, keypads, cameras, mobile, the cloud: we are more and more directly and instantly linked to a widening circle of people, while opening up our personal lives to surveillance and potential manipulation by governments, advertisers, or worse.Brain-computer interfaces are also on their way. There are already brain implants that can mitigate some of the symptoms of brain conditions, from Parkinson’s disease to depression. Others are being developed to overcome sensory impairments such as blindness or to control a paralysed limb. On the other hand, the remote control of behaviour using implanted brain stimulators has been demonstrated in several animal species, a frightening technology that could be applied to humans if someone were to choose to misuse it in that way.The possibility of voluntarily networking our minds is also here. Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences. The fusion of such systems with the human brain is not possible with today’s technology – but it is imaginable in the decades to come. Were an electronic implant developed that could vastly improve your memory and intelligence, would you be tempted? Such technologies may be on the horizon, and science fiction imaginings such as Ghost in the Shell suggest that their power to fundamentally change the human condition should not be underestimated.Tony Prescott is a professor of cognitive neuroscience and Director of the Sheffield Robotics Institute, University of SheffieldThis article first appeared on The Conversation (theconversation.com)Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

26-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/ghostintheshell-a7665671.html,Ghost in the Shell falls short of anime original | The Independent | The Independent,"How closely will we live with the technology we use in the future? How will it change us? And how close is “close”? Ghost in the Shell imagines a futuristic, hi-tech but grimy and ghetto-ridden Japanese metropolis populated by people, robots, and technologically-enhanced human cyborgs.Beyond the superhuman strength, resilience, and X-ray vision provided by bodily enhancements, one of the most transformative aspects of this world is the idea of brain augmentation, that as cyborgs we might have two brains rather than one. Our biological brain – the “ghost” in the “shell” – would interface via neural implants to powerful embedded computers that would give us lightening fast reactions and heightened powers of reasoning, learning and memory.First written as a Manga comic series in 1989 during the early days of the internet, Ghost in the Shell’s creator, Japanese artist Masamune Shirow, foresaw that this brain-computer interface would overcome the fundamental limitation of the human condition: that our minds are trapped inside our heads. In Shirow’s transhuman future our minds would be free to roam, relaying thoughts and imaginings to other networked brains, entering via the cloud into distant devices and sensors, even “deep diving” the mind of another in order to understand and share their experiences.Shirow’s stories also pin-pointed some of the dangers of this giant technological leap. In a world where knowledge is power, these brain-computer interfaces would create new tools for government surveillance and control, and new kinds of crime such as “mind-jacking” – the remote control of another’s thoughts and actions. Nevertheless there was also a spiritual side to Shirow’s narrative: that the cyborg condition might be the next step in our evolution, and that the widening of perspective and the merging of individuality from a networking of minds could be a path to enlightenment.Lost in translationBorrowing heavily from Ghost in the Shell’s re-telling by director Mamoru Oshii in his classic 1995 animated film version, the newly arrived Hollywood cinematic interpretation stars Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cyborg working for Section 9, a government-run security organisation charged with fighting corruption and terrorism. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the new film is visually stunning and the storyline lovingly recreates some of the best scenes from the original anime.Sadly though, Sanders’ movie pulls its punches around the core question of how this technology could change the human condition. Indeed, if casting Western actors in most key roles wasn’t enough, the new film also engages in a form of cultural appropriation by superimposing the myth of the American all-action hero – who you are is defined by what you do – on a character who is almost the complete antithesis of that notion.Major fights the battles of her masters with increasing reluctance, questioning the actions asked of her, drawn to escape and contemplation. This is no action hero, but someone trying to piece together fragments of meaning from within her cyborg existence with which to assemble a worthwhile life.✕Ghost In The ShellA scene midway through the film shows, even more bluntly, the central role of memory in creating the self. We see the complete breakdown of a man who, having been mind-jacked, faces the realisation that his identity is built on false memories of a life never lived, and a family who never existed. The 1995 anime insists that we are individuals only because of our memories. While the new film retains much of the same story line, it refuses to follow the inference. Rather than being defined by our memories, Major’s voice tells us that “we cling to memories as if they define us, but what we do defines us”. Perhaps this is meant to be reassuring, but to me it is both confusing and unfaithful to the spirit of the original tale.The new film also backs away from another key idea of Shirow’s work, that the human mind – even the human species – are, in essence, information. Where the 1995 anime talked of the possibility of leaving the physical body – the shell – elevating consciousness to a higher plane and “becoming part of all things”, the remake has only veiled hints that such a merging minds, or a melding of the human mind with the internet, could be either positive or transformational.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upOpen livesIn the real world, the notion of networked minds is already upon us. Touchscreens, keypads, cameras, mobile, the cloud: we are more and more directly and instantly linked to a widening circle of people, while opening up our personal lives to surveillance and potential manipulation by governments, advertisers, or worse.Brain-computer interfaces are also on their way. There are already brain implants that can mitigate some of the symptoms of brain conditions, from Parkinson’s disease to depression. Others are being developed to overcome sensory impairments such as blindness or to control a paralysed limb. On the other hand, the remote control of behaviour using implanted brain stimulators has been demonstrated in several animal species, a frightening technology that could be applied to humans if someone were to choose to misuse it in that way.The possibility of voluntarily networking our minds is also here. Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences. The fusion of such systems with the human brain is not possible with today’s technology – but it is imaginable in the decades to come. Were an electronic implant developed that could vastly improve your memory and intelligence, would you be tempted? Such technologies may be on the horizon, and science fiction imaginings such as Ghost in the Shell suggest that their power to fundamentally change the human condition should not be underestimated.Tony Prescott is a professor of cognitive neuroscience and Director of the Sheffield Robotics Institute, University of SheffieldThis article first appeared on The Conversation (theconversation.com)Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences. The fusion of such systems with the human brain is not possible with today’s technology – but it is imaginable in the decades to come. Were an electronic implant developed that could vastly improve your memory and intelligence, would you be tempted? Such technologies may be on the horizon, and science fiction imaginings such as Ghost in the Shell suggest that their power to fundamentally change the human condition should not be underestimated.Tony Prescott is a professor of cognitive neuroscience and Director of the Sheffield Robotics Institute, University of SheffieldThis article first appeared on The Conversation (theconversation.com)Register for free to continue reading  Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalismBy registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalistsregisterEmailPlease enter a valid emailPlease enter a valid emailPasswordMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberMust be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a numberFirst namePlease enter your first nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersLast namePlease enter your last nameSpecial characters aren’t allowedPlease enter a name between 1 and 40 charactersSelect your year of birth2004200320022001200019991998199719961995199419931992199119901989198819871986198519841983198219811980197919781977197619751974197319721971197019691968196719661965196419631962196119601959195819571956195519541953195219511950194919481947194619451944194319421941194019391938193719361935193419331932193119301929192819271926192519241923192219211920191919181917191619151914You must be over 18 years old to registerYou must be over 18 years old to registerYear of birthI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.  Read our Privacy noticeOpt-out-policyYou can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.

26-04-2022,anime,2,0,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/ghostintheshell-a7665671.html,Ghost in the Shell falls short of anime original | The Independent | The Independent,"How closely will we live with the technology we use in the future? How will it change us? And how close is “close”? Ghost in the Shell imagines a futuristic, hi-tech but grimy and ghetto-ridden Japanese metropolis populated by people, robots, and technologically-enhanced human cyborgs.Beyond the superhuman strength, resilience, and X-ray vision provided by bodily enhancements, one of the most transformative aspects of this world is the idea of brain augmentation, that as cyborgs we might have two brains rather than one. Our biological brain – the “ghost” in the “shell” – would interface via neural implants to powerful embedded computers that would give us lightening fast reactions and heightened powers of reasoning, learning and memory.First written as a Manga comic series in 1989 during the early days of the internet, Ghost in the Shell’s creator, Japanese artist Masamune Shirow, foresaw that this brain-computer interface would overcome the fundamental limitation of the human condition: that our minds are trapped inside our heads. In Shirow’s transhuman future our minds would be free to roam, relaying thoughts and imaginings to other networked brains, entering via the cloud into distant devices and sensors, even “deep diving” the mind of another in order to understand and share their experiences.Shirow’s stories also pin-pointed some of the dangers of this giant technological leap. In a world where knowledge is power, these brain-computer interfaces would create new tools for government surveillance and control, and new kinds of crime such as “mind-jacking” – the remote control of another’s thoughts and actions. Nevertheless there was also a spiritual side to Shirow’s narrative: that the cyborg condition might be the next step in our evolution, and that the widening of perspective and the merging of individuality from a networking of minds could be a path to enlightenment.Lost in translationBorrowing heavily from Ghost in the Shell’s re-telling by director Mamoru Oshii in his classic 1995 animated film version, the newly arrived Hollywood cinematic interpretation stars Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cyborg working for Section 9, a government-run security organisation charged with fighting corruption and terrorism. Directed by Rupert Sanders, the new film is visually stunning and the storyline lovingly recreates some of the best scenes from the original anime.Sadly though, Sanders’ movie pulls its punches around the core question of how this technology could change the human condition. Indeed, if casting Western actors in most key roles wasn’t enough, the new film also engages in a form of cultural appropriation by superimposing the myth of the American all-action hero – who you are is defined by what you do – on a character who is almost the complete antithesis of that notion.Major fights the battles of her masters with increasing reluctance, questioning the actions asked of her, drawn to escape and contemplation. This is no action hero, but someone trying to piece together fragments of meaning from within her cyborg existence with which to assemble a worthwhile life.✕Ghost In The ShellA scene midway through the film shows, even more bluntly, the central role of memory in creating the self. We see the complete breakdown of a man who, having been mind-jacked, faces the realisation that his identity is built on false memories of a life never lived, and a family who never existed. The 1995 anime insists that we are individuals only because of our memories. While the new film retains much of the same story line, it refuses to follow the inference. Rather than being defined by our memories, Major’s voice tells us that “we cling to memories as if they define us, but what we do defines us”. Perhaps this is meant to be reassuring, but to me it is both confusing and unfaithful to the spirit of the original tale.The new film also backs away from another key idea of Shirow’s work, that the human mind – even the human species – are, in essence, information. Where the 1995 anime talked of the possibility of leaving the physical body – the shell – elevating consciousness to a higher plane and “becoming part of all things”, the remake has only veiled hints that such a merging minds, or a melding of the human mind with the internet, could be either positive or transformational.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upOpen livesIn the real world, the notion of networked minds is already upon us. Touchscreens, keypads, cameras, mobile, the cloud: we are more and more directly and instantly linked to a widening circle of people, while opening up our personal lives to surveillance and potential manipulation by governments, advertisers, or worse.Brain-computer interfaces are also on their way. There are already brain implants that can mitigate some of the symptoms of brain conditions, from Parkinson’s disease to depression. Others are being developed to overcome sensory impairments such as blindness or to control a paralysed limb. On the other hand, the remote control of behaviour using implanted brain stimulators has been demonstrated in several animal species, a frightening technology that could be applied to humans if someone were to choose to misuse it in that way.The possibility of voluntarily networking our minds is also here. Devices like the Emotiv are simple wearable electroencephalograph-based (EEG) devices that can detect some of the signature electrical signals emitted by our brains, and are sufficiently intelligent to interpret those signals and turn them into useful output. For example, an Emotiv connected to a computer can control a videogame by the power of the wearer’s thoughts alone.In terms of artificial intelligence, the work in my lab at Sheffield Robotics explores the possibility of building robot analogues of human memory for events and experiences.
