The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good. Do yourself a favor and give the series a shot.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority. It's that good.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide The Demon Girl Next Door Season 2   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of The Demon Girl Next Door (TV 2) ?                     Community score: 4.4              What is this?   Yūko Yoshida is a 15-year-old girl who awakens one morning with demonic power, and is tasked with defeating a local magical girl. She has horns and a tail, but truthfully less power than an ordinary girl. She struggles to lift the ""curse of a 40,000 yen (about US$365) per month living."" (from manga)   The Demon Girl Next Door is based on Izumo Ito's manga and streams on HIDIVE on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   James Beckett  Rating:                So, here's a funny story: I somehow got The Demon Girl Next Door confused with last year's The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!. Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority.

Once I realized my initial mix-up, I spent some time scouring wikis to give myself a crash course on the basic premise, but honestly, I was nowhere near as lost as I feared I would be. If you ever needed proof that The Preview Guide sometimes works in mysterious ways, it turns out that I loved every second of this sequel, and it is easily the best premiere I've seen all week.    I'm sure there are plenty of in-jokes and callbacks I missed, but it's easy enough to get the gist: It's a world of magical girls and demons living in modern Japan, and wacky shenanigans are going to ensue when they try to get along. Yuko (aka Shamiko) is a fiesty but but well-meaning demon; Momo is a reserved and somewhat awkward magical girl; Lilith is Shamiko's ancestor that looks like a cartoon mascot sex toy for some reason; Shamiko's father is a literal cardboard box called Daddy Box, and her family uses him as a kitchen appliance and dining table.    You know. Your everyday sort of stuff!    Here's the thing: If an anime manages to make me laugh, it's already earned a hell of a lot of goodwill in my book, and The Demon Girl Next Door had me absolutely cackling. Even better, all of the jokes were rooted in surprisingly strong and deliberate writing, so I was able to catch up on a lot of the character dynamics and backstory. I learned that Lilith is a charming little gremlin, that Mikan loves putting lemons in food, and that Momo is almost certainly the best girl of the series and also definitely in love with her rival Shamiko.    I know that this one will likely fly under the radar since it's only streaming on HIDIVE, but if you take only a single thing away from my Preview Guide dispatches this spring, let it be this: this one episode of The Demon Girl Next Door made me into a convert, and catching up on Season 1 is going to become a top priority.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Ascendance of a Bookworm Season 3   Apr 13th 2022                   How would you rate episode 27 of Ascendance of a Bookworm (TV 3) ?                     Community score: 4.5              What is this?   Main continues to prepare for her winter stay at the cathedral. Worried about missing her family, but still realizing this move is best for everyone in the long run, she works on her various other affairs in the meantime, including the production of the picture book, and entering into a patron-ship with Johann the blacksmith that could pay dividends for her literary ambitions later. But her efforts at advancing printing tech hasn't gone unnoticed by other forces as well, with the Ink Guild setting their sights on her, possibly motivated by even more powerful, complex backings. With outside pressures like those forcing Main to move up her time to go stay at the cathedral, she will have to ready herself for this more strenuous next phase of her life in this world.    Ascendance of a Bookworm is based on Miya Kazuki's ""biblia fantasy"" novel and streams on Crunchyroll on Mondays.      How was the first episode?    Christopher Farris  Rating:                Coming off the previous seasons of the show (and a couple more since-released OVA episodes) the premiere of the new season of Ascendance of a Bookworm seems to mostly be about getting audiences back up to speed. The framing is focused on Main's continued preparations to stay at the cathedral for the winter, with other continuing plot and character points reiterated while potential new ones seeded. There are a few major shifts already reached by the end of this one, but for the most part, it really just feels like recap and setup. That's hardly a bad thing for a series as dense and as detailed as Bookworm, which means that picking things up after the previous break should be comfortable enough for the returning audience.    That sheer density is still definitely an element you feel in this one, though. Seemingly as a result of kicking off a new season and story arc, this premiere makes a point of parading out dang near every still-relevant character from Main's journey up until now, trying to remind you, at least a little, of how they all fit together into this storied setup. Some of it feels plenty natural, like Freida popping in to update us on the sales of the pound cakes and advance some more details on the picture book. As well, Johann's inclusion marks a major turning point for where part of this story will be going, and the focus on Main with her parents and sister is specifically integrated here due to what the tone and themes of this episode end up being. But at the same time, you've got bits like Main hanging out with Corrina and Otto while getting fitted for new robes, or entertaining split-second interactions with her retainers which amount to feeling like little more than cameos or even mere background noise amongst everything else this episode is doing.    That extends to some of the plot components being put in play here as well. Even understanding how intricately the show depicts medieval-style politicking, it still comes off as kinda funny that something as mundane-sounding as the 'Ink Guild' will be providing the antagonistic force in the story for the near future. Once again, just the bare basics of their inclusion are set up in this one, as we remain pretty in the dark regarding what their issue with Main's ink production is and what behind-the-scenes powers are motivating their pursuit of her or roughing up of Lutz. It comes off similarly to so many of the rote preparations we see Main going through here to ready herself for moving into the cathedral, very much having the feeling of ""Get this taken care of so we can get the really dramatic parts of the plot under way"".    But to its credit, Ascendance of a Bookworm still knows how to present all that nuts-and-bolts story structuring with enough equal intrigue and heart to keep us invested amongst it all. Obviously there's continued appreciation for the little historical-style details to the preparation, such as the point that preparing clothing is a major factor for something like a winter stay, especially for someone with as fragile a constitution as Main. More pertinently to this story's ambitions, though, is the side setup of Johann meeting back up with Main and imploring her to join his Patreon. Yes, much of this is more storytelling of the technical variety, but the resultant goal of Main commissioning the production of metal letter types very pointedly puts us back onto that long-term goal of advancing book production. It's rewarding to see this progress, and even comes with Main pointing out that she hasn't gotten to nerd out about her aspirations like this in a while.    But even with all the recap refreshers and technical story setups, the heart of the series is still felt in a lot of these bits, and keeps Bookworm feeling as much itself as ever. In between the explanations, Main's rapport with the likes of Freida, Benno, and Lutz is fun to watch. More importantly, that time spent showing her with her family pays off strongly, as we realize it's going to be a while before we see her with them again, and grasp that Main herself is coming to terms with that. After those warm shots of all of them together, the contrast with the tiny girl alone in her huge new bed hits hard, to the point where the immediate narration about how quickly Main became homesick is honestly unneeded. But as with all the other structural components assembled over the course of this, the whole thing still fits together like so many movable letter types, creating a first page for this show's next season that's as detailed and engaging as the series has always been.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose. They'd much rather hear they're previous view be confirmed, ie that landlord and company are evil and the cause of all their problems.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

Feels more like generic secondhand Americana. It's certainly no Macross Frontier.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco. Feels more like generic secondhand Americana...           I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.      Back to top                   Ishida_Akira(fake)    Joined: 23 Apr 2022 		    Posts: 4       Posted: Sun Apr 24, 2022 9:34 pm            I tried to watch this show, but I could not get passed the 2nd episode. I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

(So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize.

Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.

Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

And of course, obviously cities have to change over time because older people are going to be replaced by younger people, who have different interests - when that doesn't happen it just empties out as in Sakura Quest.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize. (Not to name names on an anime forum…)   Some much better writing by a local Black affordable housing developer:   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-look-of-gentrification   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in   https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/the-history-of-gentrification-in-111   Personally I'd rather talk about ""displacement"" than ""gentrification"", since it's more specific and people seem to think you stop ""gentrification"" by not painting bike lanes.   As for whether gentrification is caused by things other than housing prices… unfortunately, if this is about SF, literally everything is about housing prices.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show. Misses it's own point and doesn't even look good while doing it.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

Quote:    While I'm not from San Francisco, I live in a city that has undergone a lot of gentrification due to tech companies over the last decade.            No, you are not. Gentrification is due to not building enough housing. The people who oppose development cause housing prices to go up and people to be unable to afford to live there anymore. Many of these people view themselves as on the Left, or pro environment, or most view themselves as opposing gentrification even as they make it much, much worse than in places that, unlike San Francisco and the surrounding areas, didn't have a dramatic slow down in housing production.   Some people admit and understand that they are being exclusionary when they prevent housing from people built. Others do not, and may not even understand it themselves. But San Francisco's insane housing prices are almost entirely from not building housing (though Prop 13 makes it easy for people who already own housing to oppose new housing.) Even building luxury housing keeps rich people from turning cheap housing into expensive housing. Research and experience overwhelmingly demonstrates that even building expensive housing reduces housing prices in the neighborhood and the metropolitan area.   By failing to understand the problem, you make the problem worse, even if you mean well or identify the problem. Thankfully some people are waking up to how SF's no growth policies have driven away the low income and black and Hispanic population of SF, as we just saw David Campos lose his primary.

It's good to remember that any show is first and foremost supposed to be entertaining and very few people are entertain by being told/lectured about something they oppose.

You're making up an argument of how you think the show's messaging is framed while admitting you have no comment on the show because you haven't watched it. The entire basis of your statement could be entirely imaginary without knowing how the show actually presents its themes.     Quote:    Gentrification is due to not building enough housing.            Gentrification is taking neighborhoods that were culturally and demographically not white, pushing the residents of those neighborhoods out via rent and price increases, and then wallpapering over all the unique businesses that existed there. Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.   Also the way you're approaching the writer by attempting to negate their experience and indirectly  call them stupid is rude and unwarranted.

But gentrification happens in a whooole lot of places, including countries/regions that are racially and ethnically a lot more homogenous (or at least far less diverse) than the US, where it manifests in different ways although the end result is the same: people with less income are pushed out by people with more income. Hell, where I live what usually happens is that residents get pushed out via rent and price increases driven by tourism/Airbnb (landlords realizing that tourists, expats, foreign students, etc. with western European/American/other backgrounds are able and willing to pay a lot more than local renters), which also includes tourist- and expat-focusing businesses coming in and making places unliveable due to noise pollution, driving grocery/service/etc. prices up, and so on.     ANN_Lynzee wrote:    Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.           Honestly, as cynical as the argument is, it would be at least some sort of a help for those who have already lost their original place. Except it's not happening, at least in my city there's a ton of new houses being built, none of them even remotely affordable to anyone who is not at least upper middle class (and willing to pay back a loan for the rest of their life). They're built mostly as investment for rich people to buy and then rent out for insane prices as Airbnb, for foreign travelers or expats, etc. And so, with the increase of gentrification and lower income people having to move to shittier housing, the rent/price of shittier housing also goes up, and it's an evil, vicious circle.   Anyway, in short, gentrification is, at its roots, a class thing, not necessarily just a race/ethnicity thing.

I loved the fun ED. I liked the contrast between the vibrant colors of the city and the drab black of the evil corporation. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonbinary characters who were just there living their lives; the owner of the arcade was possibly a transwoman who was kind to the young customers and had no okama stereotypes based on what I saw. However the transformation sequence and and conflicts in the show were repetitive and dull. The formula felt shoehorned in as an artifact of the original since there's no tension or uncertainty that Muteki would win. They felt rather pointless and shallow compared to the complex issue of gentrification, so I doubted the show would reach a satisfying end. Maybe I'll go back and finish it someday.

Gentrification affects areas in different ways based on the demographic and history of the specific region. In the Bay Area, we have had notorious issues with exclusionary zoning and consequent segregation. We are one of the most diverse places in the world, but poor, middle class, and rich live in their separate areas, which can then be easily broken down into Asian, White, Black, and Latinx neighborhoods. There isn't much integration overall even today and the quality of life can vastly differ within a mile. There have been arguments that housing wouldn't be such a problem if we tore down the zoning laws and had more mixed-use development, but then the people who live in wealthy places would have to deal with others intruding into their lives. They already fight against public transportation placed anywhere nearby. It's really complicated and Muteking was not equipped to tackle such a difficult situation.     wolf10 wrote:    I'm San Francisco born and raised, but I have to say, going by the first few episodes, I am really disappointed with how little this show's setting resembles San Francisco.

I think the creators would have to understand what it's like to live in SF over many years and bear witness to the changes that have happened over the past few decades. If they consulted with researchers or knew long-time residents, maybe it would have been more accurate.

Your argument seems to be that this is fine and not gentrification so long as we build new, low-income housing for them to migrate to.            The post you're responding to unfortunately is a much better explanation of SF's housing crisis than it sounds like Muteking is, but the new housing isn't about forcing people into low-income housing. Rather the problem is there isn't any housing of any kind, ever, because the city is basically determined to stop anyone from ever moving to it. So:   - there's no expensive housing, so richer people instead outbid poorer people for the existing older housing. (So building more expensive housing prevents gentrification through ""yuppie fishbowls"".)   - while all existing housing is rent-controlled, there's no new rent-controlled housing built either, so gentrification happens just because their own children can't afford to live there and have to leave.   - if you've lived there since the 70s, you're now a millionaire if you sell your house, so otherwise poor people might want to do that anyway.   - and there's also not enough schools or large enough houses for families, so they tend to move out once families get bigger and are replaced by single people/couples.   It's not because of ""tech"" though. The tech boom in SF is very recent and displacement happened before they got there. The explanation Muteking gives for this is pretty common in the area though; it's called ""left-NIMBYism"" and the people who believe it tend to be DSA members whose parents turn out to be landlords, socialists on the SF city council who own mansions, or leftist magazine owners known on Twitter for firing all their writers when they tried to unionize.

I figured it'd annoy everyone one way or the other, either from not being able to get past the cheesy superhero bits or the swings it took at serious subject matters despite adamantly sticking to being a cheesy superhero show (either because they're there or because they can only go so far). So, uhh, comments here seem to line up with that pretty well, for the most part...   I'm glad to see a largely (if not entirely) positive review in any case, because if you go into it with juuuust the right mindset, it's a real good time and has its heart in the right place.

I want to mention that I loved Crows, and even Insight was quite decent to me. But this one was just... bad. First off, the dancing is terrible, and for a show that has that as its theme, the dancing should be at least good. But my problem is that the antagonists are literally the same as the old Legion of Doom from the old Avengers cartoon: cartoonishly evil. I admit I don't really care about gentrification, but as this review said, there should be something else for me here. There isn't. The animation is pretty bad, the characters are one-dimensional.... and to be quite honest, it doesn't even seem to get the gentrification part right. From my understanding, the way it works is that a poor neighborhood is significantly improved, but in such a way that the cost of living there also increases, making it hard or even impossible for the people who were living there in the first place to continue doing so. So give this one a pass and check out Crowds and Insight if you want to see some tokusatsu tackle social issues. I would also recommend Yoru no Yatterman as well, but that one fumbled the second half so bad it's not worth talking about it.   tl:rd: Not a good show.

Visit news.dexclub.com for all the latest news in Thai.                Advertising              Thank you for your interest in advertising on Anime News Network. Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

Founded in 1998, Anime News Network is the world's leading source of up to date news and information on the anime and manga industries. Regular readers of Anime News Network not only include hundreds of thousands of anime fans, but also all of the industry heavy weights. The past several years have witnessed an attrition of English anime news sites on the Internet; as the number of sites shrink, the remaining sites only get better. Consistently growing and improving, Anime News Network is here to stay. The key benefit in advertising on Anime News Network is that our readership fits a particular demographic; mature anime fans. The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade? With the exception of anime conventions and charities, ANN does not trade advertising.  Convention Trades The convention trades are back! We have two trade programs available.    Non Profit Anime and Manga Conventions under 30K attendance: We can trade you for 100% of your advertising on ANN. Provide ANN with up to $5,000 of advertising in your program guide or on site, and we will provide you an equal value on ANN.  Other Anime, manga and geek culture conventions: We provide a 50% trade with no max value. You can pay for half the value of your advertisements on ANN with advertisements in your program guide or on-site. EG: If you give us $5,000 of ads at the convention, you only have to pay us $5,000 for $10,000 worth of advertising on ANN.  For Networks We are not looking for any advertising networks at this time. Agencies and rep firms are welcome to contact us, but no networks/exchanges/rtb platforms. No Bootlegs! No Pirates! Important: Don't waste our time if you sell bootleg/pirate DVDs or host unlicensed content on your website. Not only will we not allow you to advertise with us, but we'll probably report you to the appropriate authorities, licensors and/or licensees. We do not consider gray market imports of otherwise legal goods, or doujinshi, ""bootlegs,"" although we may require potential advertisers to prove that their gray market imports are legal goods.             bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    Misc Page homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The majority of visitors to Anime News Network are between the ages of 18 and 24 and, needless to say, they're all anime fans, but also have a healthy appetite for other forms of animation, video games, and many other related interests. As long as you are interested in reaching anime fans that make their own purchasing decisions, Anime News Network is the ideal place for you to advertise. Please contact us at [email protected] (advertising at animenewsnetwork.com) for more information regarding advertising opportunities. Self-Serve ANN's minimum buy is $3000, but if your budget is lower than $3000 you can now buy ads directly from our self-serve advertising system. The minimum buy is only $10.   The self serve system is also great for people who know what they want and don't want to waste time.   What are you waiting for? Buy ads right here, right now.  Want to Trade?

Backlog dub (started airing Fall 2021) that was out-sourced to NYAV Post, so unfortunately not much of a change regarding what CR intends to do in-studio.   I will say I do typically love NYAV Post as a studio (even though the director is super new to directing solo), but man it feels like CR/Funi always gives them the short end of the stick when it comes to projects compared to Sound Cadence or even Kocha.

Apparently Billy Kametz is also not feeling well (he canceled a convention appearance and the Tokyo 24th Ward dub has been delayed), so that might delay the dubs for Shield Hero season 2 and Science Fell in Love season 2 (although I would think he would have recorded the last two episodes of 86 by now).

Backlog dub (started airing Fall 2021) that was out-sourced to NYAV Post, so unfortunately not much of a change regarding what CR intends to do in-studio.   I will say I do typically love NYAV Post as a studio (even though the director is super new to directing solo), but man it feels like CR/Funi always gives them the short end of the stick when it comes to projects compared to Sound Cadence or even Kocha.

Apparently Billy Kametz is also not feeling well (he canceled a convention appearance and the Tokyo 24th Ward dub has been delayed), so that might delay the dubs for Shield Hero season 2 and Science Fell in Love season 2 (although I would think he would have recorded the last two episodes of 86 by now).

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More          ⬈ ⬋ - +                            news          8 comments       Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time Anime Season 2 Reveals Title, New Cast & Staff, Game   Apr 26, 07:24 8 comments                 anime    Kana Yūki, Shiori Izawa join cast; Seven joins Wolfsbane on animation production ― The official website for the second season of the television anime of Daisuke Hiyama's Peter Grill and the Philosopher's Time (Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan) manga revealed the second season's title as Peter Grill to Kenja no Jikan Super Extra.

The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task   Apr  8th 2022                   How would you rate episode 1 of Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task ?                     Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives           RightStuf - Anime, Manga and More      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives      ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.     discuss this in the forum (307 posts) |        bookmark/share with:                         this article has been modified since it was originally posted;      see change history    back to The Spring 2022 Preview Guide Season Preview Guide homepage / archives    ",positive,en,"{'https://twitter.com/anime': 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/c/animenewsnetworkANN': 1, 'https://www.facebook.com/animenewsnetwork': 1, 'https://www.instagram.com/animenewsnetwork/': 1, 'http://news.dexclub.com': 4}"

There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.      Richard Eisenbeis  Rating:                This first episode threw me for a loop. Despite going in blind, from almost the first scene, I had a strange sense of familiarity: the school, the uniforms, even some of the characters. And then, as Hiyori wandered aimlessly through the school and met her upper classmen, I realized this is set in the same world as the two Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai HoneyWorks films from 2016—which completely changed how I was viewing the show. I suddenly cared far more about the background characters and how they were getting on rather than our main trio.    That said, Hiyori is not a bad character. “Country girl comes to the big city” is a trope as old as time and she is likable enough. Rather than being a blank slate of innocence, she is both earnest and opinionated. She knows what she wants to do and what is important to her. It makes her feel like a real person rather than a walking cliché.    The episode also sets up the anime's main conceit in a believable fashion. Hiyori needs a part-time job and ends up becoming the assistant manager to the two boys in her class who are also popstars. While it seems far-fetched on face value, Hiyori really is the best for the job. Because she is their classmate, her working hours match up with theirs, and she will be on hand to make sure they don't break character and reveal their obvious dislike for each other at school. But honestly, the best reason is that not only does she dislike idols in general but Aizo and Yujiro specifically. She won't be swooning for them and won't be easily steamrolled by them.    What strained my disbelief in this episode wasn't Hiyori being in the same class as two pop idols—nor was it her becoming their manager by the end of the episode. Rather it was that she could afford an apartment in Shibuya (one of the most expensive places to live in all of Japan). Even with her 1,500 yen an hour job, she'd be needing to work more than 40 hours a week just to make rent on the cheapest place I could find—and that's before adding in things like food and daily necessities. In a world where teens often commute hours to school, I'm not sure why they chose to establish Hiyori living in Shibuya but it's completely insane.    While not a bad half-hour of TV, I doubt I'd be coming back for a second episode if it weren't for this show's connection to Kokuhaku Jikkou linkai. I don't really care for Aizo and Yujiro, and while Hiyori is interesting enough, she can't really carry the show on her own. However, with a supporting cast filled with characters I do care about... well, we'll just have to see if this show can come into its own before I completely lose interest.      James Beckett  Rating:                Heroines Run the Show has a perfectly watchable and good-natured premiere that, unfortunately, happened to rub me the exact wrong way. I can see how this anime could be a fun time, both for fans of idol anime and for anyone looking for more comedies to fill out their Spring Watchlist, but I honestly had to force myself to get through most of this episode, and I had to take a couple of breaks just to even manage that. It's not a bad first episode, by any means, but I can't say that I'm eager to revisit Heroines Run the Show any time soon.    A lot of what grinded my gears in this premiere comes down to the main character, Hiyori, which I almost feel bad saying, because she's a nice girl that's just trying her best to survive in the big city. It's just that her “Golly Gee! I'm Such An Inexperienced Small-Town Bumpkin!” shtick, combined with her aggressively twee personality, is such a fine line to walk, even in the best of circumstances. What pushes Hiyori over the edge of “Adorkable” and into the realm of “Okay, Seriously, Turn It Down a Few Notches” is her voice actress, Inori Minase. Now, I'm not about to badmouth such a prolific talent as Minase; the woman has talent to spare, and the filmography to prove it. Here, though, she adopts this incredibly grating vocal affectation that gave me Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out! flashbacks, and it made it very difficult for me to appreciate a lot of scenes that should have been sweet and charming.    The rest of the premiere also takes its sweet time getting to the point of having Hiyori become the “manager-in-training” for the duo of high-maintenance idol boys that conveniently attend her school, and yet the “idol” aspect of the show still ends up coming across as a bit under-baked, since so much of this premiere is actually devoted to Hiyori's love of running track. I have no doubt that the show will devote plenty more time to the showbiz angle of Hiyori's new job in future episodes, but wouldn't have minded if this first outing had a touch more focus and direction.    Still, I can recognize that this was not at all a “bad” anime, and Heroines Run the Show will likely earn itself plenty of fans over the course of the season. I won't be one of them, but that's okay. And who knows? Maybe I'll come back to the series in a couple of weeks and discover an idol anime that's worth rooting for! I'll probably just have to watch it on mute.       Nicholas Dupree  Rating:               I was looking forward to this one. Not because I'm familiar with the HoneyWorks songs it's inspired by, or because I knew all that much about the premise or staff going in, though. No, what had me excited was just our main heroine's face. One look at those big, honkin' sausage eyebrows and I was ready to die for this girl. And now that I've actually watched the first episode, I'm also ready to kill for her, should the need arise.    Pretty much this whole episode is just about getting to know Hiyori as she ventures into the unfamiliar worlds of Tokyo and High School. We do eventually get to the hook – Hiyori gets a job as the manager-in-training for a duo of idol boys who are also in her class at school – but only in the final moments of this premiere. Everything before that is just about gradually showing us who our titular heroine is – what she loves, what she's bad at, how she makes (or doesn't make) friends, and just getting a strong dose of her lovable personality. It's super sweet, and a good chunk of that is down to just how expressive she is. Between her eyebrows, her high energy movement, and her body language it's hard not to be charmed as she bumbles her way through the ups and downs of high school life. Watching her slog through the endless cycle of job applications and interviews hit especially hard, and declaring her reason for applying is because “I need it to live!” had me ready to stan this doofus full-throttle.    The one downside there is that we don't yet have a good idea of the side characters, or what the dynamic of the show will be going forward. We know the main idols boys are far less gracious than their public personas, and seem to hate each other's guts behind the scenes, but we have no clue why. We meet several other characters who are presumably part of our extended cast, but most of them never interact with Hiyori, so how they're connected to anything going on with our central trio is largely a mystery. All those question marks don't need to be a problem, but in a show as character-driven as this one, it's a little uneasy to not know what our main characters' dynamic will be like going forward. Hiyori may be a wonderful bundle of chipmunk energy, but if everyone around her is a jerk, I don't know how entertaining that will be.    But for now, at least, this is a super charming beginning. It's well-paced, features lots of lovely and expressive animation, and more than made me want to see Hiyori clear the hurdles in front of her. That's plenty of motivation to keep following this one.       Rebecca Silverman  Rating:               I have heard Inori Minase in many roles where I have enjoyed her performance. Heroines Run the Show is, thus far, not one of them. I bring this up strictly because Hiyori's voice, which is somehow louder than everything else in the show, is like nails on a chalkboard to my ears. I'm not entirely sure why, but something about it made me wish I had a mute button just for her.    That's a shame, because this is actually looking like a pretty fun show. Hiyori's total disinterest in idols doesn't remarkably transform the moment she realizes that LIPxLIP, the hottest boy idol duo, are in her class at her new Tokyo high school; in fact, their behavior makes her go from “disinterest” straight to “disdain,” and that's absolutely deserved, because both Aizo and Yujiro are jerks, especially to her. Besides, Hiyori didn't come to the big city to gawk at hot guys; she's here to participate in her chosen sport, track, and nothing is going to prevent her from doing what she loves. Her go-getter attitude is another really fun piece of the story, because she truly is focused on what she wants to do and what she needs to do in order to get there. When her dad hurts his back, she decides to get a job so that her parents don't have to send money, but not even this can make her give up on her track aspirations. Yes, this makes job hunting harder, but it's also a very nice way to show how important it is to her without having her talk endlessly on the subject. There's no big surprise when the one job she gets involves her least favorite idols, but watching her win them over (or wear them down) while remaining true to herself would be a fun direction for this to go in.    I wouldn't be myself if I didn't also mention that the opening theme makes use of the fairy tale classified as ATU432, The Bird Lover. The most commonly known variant of this tale type is the French The Blue Bird, recorded by Madame d'Aulnoy in 1697. Basically, stories that fall under this heading involve a woman whose noble lover takes the form of a bird and falls into a trap; in the French version specifically called L'oiseau bleu, there's one prince and two princesses, a kind and an unkind one, along with an evil fairy godmother. If I had to guess, Hiyori is meant to be the kind princess Florine while her classmate Chizuru is either unkind princess Truitonne or the evil fairy, although I could also see it being that the idols are the princesses to Hiyori's prince. In either case, that's a neat break from the usual Beauty and the Beast or Cinderella, and it piques my curiosity for where this is likely to go. It's a shame about Hiyori's voice and the oddly old-school character designs that just look kind of uncanny, but if you're looking for romantic fluff and boy idols, this may be a good choice.

Community score: 4.0              What is this?   Hiyori Suzumi is a high school girl who becomes a manager-in-training for the high school idol unit LIP×LIP. Hiyori left her hometown to pursue her passion, track and field, by enrolling in Tokyo's Sakuragaoka High School. Looking for a part-time job in Tokyo, she ended up working as an apprentice manager for her classmates (and LIP×LIP members) Yūjirō Someya and Aizō Shibasaki.    Heroines Run the Show: The Unpopular Girl and the Secret Task is based on the Vocaloid creator unit HoneyWorks' song ""Heroine Tarumono!"" and streams on Crunchyroll on Thursdays.      How was the first episode?   Caitlin Moore  Rating:                The premiere of Heroines Run the Show reminded me of Akebi's School Uniform in a few ways, including its lush animation and excitable heroine, but this time, it actually feels like a shojo series rather than a seinen series using a shojo manga aesthetic. Never mind that it's based on a Vocaloid song rather than a manga running in a shojo magazine; I'm so starved for series aimed at a female audience that aren't about primarily male casts that I'm willing to overlook little details like that.    As a heroine, Hiyori doesn't offer much in the way of surprises. As the country girl who moves to Tokyo and quickly finds herself deeper in than she expected, she's a distinct type. She dreams of eating crepes and running into celebrities, but when she finds herself quite literally stuck in the middle of two actual feuding celebrities, they're nothing like she imagined. She has thick eyebrows and messy hair and a whole bunch of siblings and—well okay, I just described myself in high school, even though I'm a city girl since the day I was born. She also has a surprising amount going on. Not only has she moved to Tokyo all by herself, she's on the track team, has new friends in her class, and is now starting a job as the personal assistant of a pair of idols on top of all that.    These disparate elements all inform each other: she moved because of the track team, needs a job because her parents have to support her siblings, and ended up with this one because of the hours she needs to devote to track practice—but it's hard to know exactly how the show will manage to interweave them. For a person, having so much go on sounds like a recipe for burnout, and for a story, it risks feeling disjointed or compressed. Even so, I like that Hiyori has so much going on. Too often in shojo melodramas, the heroine has no friends or real hobbies outside of her abusive boyfriend, sorry, I mean primary love interest. Hiyori being a well-rounded person means having support structures and people to turn to when the boys act like buttheads, and buttheads they are.    There are a lot of ways for Heroines Run the Show to trip and fall, but I want so badly to see it succeed. I'm rooting for Hiyori and everyone around her.
